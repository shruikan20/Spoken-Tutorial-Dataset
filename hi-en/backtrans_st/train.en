Welcome to this tutorial on Vector Data Styling in QGIS.
In this tutorial we will learn to,
Style vector data using, Single symbol styling ,  Categorized styling, Graduated styling, and
Labeling features.
To record this tutorial I am using,
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with QGIS interface.
If not, For relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
To practise this tutorial, you need to download the folder given in the Code files link, located below the player.
Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.
Locate world.shp file in the extracted folder.
I have already downloaded the code file, extracted and saved in a folder on Desktop.
Double-click on the code-file folder to open it.
Right-click on world.shp file.
From the context menu, select Open with QGIS Desktop  option.
QGIS interface opens.
QGIS Tips dialog-box opens.
Click on OK button to close the dialog-box.
World map loads on the canvas in the default style.
You can see the world layer in the Layers Panel.
Right-click on the world layer.
From the context menu, select Open Attribute Table.
Attribute table for this layer opens.
Here we can see all the data of various features embedded in row and column format.
The country names are given in the ADMIN column.
Drag the slider at bottom of the table and navigate to POP_EST  column.
In this column population for various countries is listed.
Next, we will depict the population data shown here, in various styles on the world map.
Close the attribute table.
Right click on the world layer.
From the context menu select Properties option.
Layer Properties dialog-box opens.
Click on Style  tab from the left panel.
Various styling options are available in the Style tab.
Click on the drop-down button located on the top left corner of the dialog-box.
You will see various styling options here.
We will explore the first three in this tutorial.
Select Single Symbol option.
This option allows you to choose a single style.
The chosen style will be applied to all the features in the layer.
Click on add Symbol layer button available under Fill panel.
Various style options appear below Symbol layer type.
Since this is a polygon dataset, we have two basic choices.
You can fill the polygon with  color and fill style of your choice.
Outline color, style and width can also be changed.
Click on the drop-down arrow next to Fill drop-down.
Color triangle opens.
Rotate the color triangle to choose the required color.
Similarly, Select  Outline color.
I will choose yellow.
Fill style as Dense1.
Outline style, solid line.
Outline width, 0.46 millimeters.
Various other style options are available to explore.
After you have completed the styling,  click on OK button at the bottom-left corner of Layers Properties dialog-box.
On the canvas, you will see the new style applied to the layer with the style pattern you chose.
Now we will see how to map the population data.
The Single Symbol style is not very useful in mapping the population data.
Let us explore another styling option.
Right-click on world layer again and choose Properties option.
In the Layers Properties dialog-box, this time we will choose Categorized from the Style tab.
Categorized means, the features in the layer will be shown in different shades of a color.
These color shades are based on the unique values in the attribute fields.
Since we are trying to map population data, in the Column drop down we will select POP_EST.
Choose a colour ramp of your choice from the drop-down.
Click on Classify button at the bottom of the middle panel.
The panel in the middle shows various classes with corresponding values.
Click on OK button at the bottom right corner.
On the world map, you will see different countries appearing in shades of blue.
Scroll down the central mouse button to zoom-in and zoom-out the map.
Lighter shades represent lower population.
Darker shades represent higher population.
Once again open Layers Properties dialog-box.
In Style tab, click on drop drown button.
Let us explore the Graduated symbology.
Graduated symbology type allows you to break down the data in a column in unique classes.
We can choose a different style for each of the classes.
From the Column drop-down, select POP_EST.
We can think of classifying our population data into 3 classes, Low, Medium and High.
So, under Classes drop-down, select 3.
You will see that 3 classes show up in the panel with corresponding values.
Click on Classify button.
Click on Mode drop-down.
There are many Mode options available here.
To keep things simple, let us use the Quantile mode.
These modes use different statistical algorithms to break down the data into separate classes.
Also note that for an attribute to be used in Graduated style, it must be numerical field.
The numerical values can be Integer or Real values.
Attribute field with String type cannot be used with this styling option.
Now on the map you will see countries in 3 different shades of blue.
These color shades represents the population data for the country.
On the Layers Panel you will see 3 classes for this layer.
There are some more styling options available.
We can choose a different style and color for each of these classes.
Open Layer Properties dialog-box again.
In Classes tab, under Symbol column, double-click on the colored box.
Symbol Selector dialog-box opens.
In the Color drop-down option, click on the drop-down arrow. Color triangle opens.
Rotate the color triangle to choose the required color.
I will choose red color to indicate low population.
Click on OK button in the Symbol selector dialog-box.
Similarly change the color for other two classes.
I will choose yellow for the medium and green for high.
Double-click on the first row in the Legend column.
Type Medium for the second row.
Double-click on the first row under Values column to edit the selected ranges.
Enter class bounds text box opens. If you wish, you may edit lower value and upper value.
For now we will leave the values unchanged.
Click on OK button in the Layer Properties dialog box.
Observe the world map.
Now we have 3 different colors to represent low, medium, high population.
Observe the Layers Panel.
There are clearly marked class names and colors to represent our interpretation of the population values.
This style conveys a lot more useful map than the previous two attempts.
Let us learn how to label different features in a vector file.
For demonstration let us label the names of the countries.
Open Layer Properties dialog box again.
From the left panel, select Labels tab.
In the first text box drop-down, select Show labels for this layer.
ADMIN column in the attribute table has list of the names of the countries.
So in the Label with drop down, select ADMIN.
In the style menu, Select Buffer.
Check the Draw text buffer  check box.
Size of the text can be changed according to requirement.
Select a color from the color drop-down.
On the world-map we can see the names of countries displayed.
Let us summarize,
In this tutorial we have learnt to
Style vector data using,   Single symbol  styling,    Categorized  styling,   Graduated  styling, and
Labeling features.
Categorise the data set POP_EST into 5 classes.
Use Graduated styling method, Equal Interval mode.
Your completed assignment should look as shown here.

Welcome to this tutorial on Raster Data Styling in QGIS.
In this tutorial, we will learn, to style a continuous raster.
To write an expression in Raster Calculator.
About raster properties.
QGIS version 2.18
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with QGIS interface.
For the prerequisite tutorials please visit our website.
Download the folder given in the Code files link, located below the player.
Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file and save it in a folder.
Here is my Code files folder.
Double-click to open the folder.
In this folder you will find Population Density grid files for the entire world, for the year 2000 and 1990.
There are two files in ASCII format, with .asc file extension.
Let us open these files in QGIS.
Close the Code files folder.
Here I have opened QGIS interface.
From the drop-down select Add Layer.
From the sub-menu, select Add Raster Layer.
A dialog-box opens.  I will navigate to the Code file folder on the Desktop.
Select the two files with .asc file extension.
Press and hold the Ctrl key, click on both the files.
Click on Open button.
Coordinate Reference System Selector opens.
In some settings, CRS will be selected automatically.
In such a situation this window may not open.
If Coordinate Reference System Selector does not open, ignore this step and proceed with the next step.
Here I will select WGS 84 EPSG 4326 from the list.
Since we are adding two layers at the same time, Coordinate Reference System Selector opens once more here.
Again select WGS 84 EPSG 4326.
On the canvas you will see a world map rendered in grayscale.
Lighter pixels indicate higher population and darker pixels indicate lower population.
In the Layers Panel, you will see both the raster layers loaded.
Each pixel in the raster has a value of population density for that grid.
To see the value of the pixel, click on Identify Features tool on the top-right corner of the toolbar.
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in the map.
Click anywhere on the raster map.
The pixel value will be displayed in the Identify Results panel.
Observe that the lighter pixel has higher value and the darker pixel has lower value.
Close the Identify Results panel.
Zoom out the map. Click on Pan Map tool and adjust the map on the canvas.
Population density pattern can be better visualized with an appropriate type of styling.
Right-click on the 1st layer in the Layers Panel.
From the context menu select Properties option.
Layer Properties dialog-box opens.
In the dialog-box select Style tab.
Under Band Rendering section, change the Render type to Singleband pseudocolor.
Let the Interpolation be Linear.
In the Color drop-down, select Spectral.
Scroll down.
Select Mode as Continuous.
You will see 5 new color values created.
Click on Apply button and OK button at the bottom right corner of the dialog-box.
Back in the QGIS Canvas, you will see the raster map displayed in 5 classes of spectral color rendering.
Follow the same steps as shown for 1
For our analysis, we would like to find areas with largest population change between years 1990 and 2000.
For this, we need to find the difference between each grid’s pixel values in both the layers.
For these calculations, we will use Raster Calculator tool.
Click on Raster menu from the menu bar.
Raster Calculator dialog-box opens.
In the Raster bands section, the names of the bands are displayed.
Since each of our rasters have only 1 band, you will see only 1 entry per raster.
The raster calculator can apply mathematical operations on the raster pixels.
In this case we want to enter a simple formula to subtract the population density for the year 1990
Under Raster bands section, select the layer by double-clicking on the raster layer for the year 2000.
The expression is now added to the Raster calculator expression section.
From the Operators section, click on subtraction operator button.
Again from the Raster bands section, double-click on raster layer for the year 1990.
The formula for the calculation is now displayed in the Raster calculator expression section.
Under Result Layer section, you will see Output layer box.
In the box, type the name of your output layer as pop-change.tif.
In the Output format drop-down, select Geo TIFF.
Output CRS option is automatically selected.  Leave it as such.
Check the box next to Add result to project.
Click on OK button at the bottom of the dialog-box.
You will see the new layer load in Layers Panel.
To view the map for the 3rd layer,  in the Layers Panel uncheck the check boxes for pop-2000 and pop-1990 layers.
We can create a much more informative map by changing the style of this layer.
Right-click on the pop-change layer.
Layer Properties dialog-box opens.
We want to style the layer such that, pixel values in certain ranges get the same color.
Click on Metadata tab, scroll down to Properties section.
Note the maximum and minimum values.
Maximum value is close to 6000.
Minimum value is just above -2000.
Go to the Style tab.
Set the Interpolation to Discrete.
Scroll down.
This is a green plus symbol button located next to Classify button.
Click the Add Values Manually button 4 times to create 4 unique classes.
These values show-up in the middle panel.
Here we have to change the values in each row.
Population values lower than the value entered, will be given the color of that entry.
Double-click on the first entry in the Values column to change the value.
We have observed, the minimum value in our metadata analysis is just above -2000.
Double-click on the color-box and change the color.
Double-click on the Label column in the first row.
Similarly fill in all the values and labels as shown here.
In the 2
In the 3
Finally 6000 to denote Positive change.
Because our maximum value from the meta data analysis is close to 6000.
At the bottom-right corner of the window, click on Apply button and then OK button.
Now on the canvas you will see a much more powerful visualization of the population data.
Here you can see clearly areas which has seen positive and negative population density changes.
Areas colored in blue denote the positive population change.
Areas in green show negative change.
Areas in pink have not see too much population change.
Let us summarize,
In this tutorial we have learnt,
As an assignment
Hint: Use Raster Calculator, write an expression to select population change less than 0.
Your completed assignment should look as shown here.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Configuring Settings in KTouch.
Change the level of training Adjust the speed of typing.
Configure shortcut keys.Configure the toolbars.View typing metrics.
Here, we are using KTouch 1.7.1 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10.
Let’s open KTouch.
We are at Level 1. Let us move on to the second level that is 2.
To increase the level of the training to 2, click on the top triangle symbol, next to the Level field.
Notice what happens when we change the level to 2.
The characters in the Teacher’s Line change!
Look at the characters displayed under the New Characters in This Level field. They’ve changed too!
These are the characters that are to be practiced for the selected level.
Now, let’s start typing.
Now let us type a character that is not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The Student's Line changes to red.
What else do you see?
The percentage displayed in the Correctness field decreases.
Let’s press backspace and delete the mistake.
Let us learn to set Training Options.
What are Training Options?
We use 'Training Options' to change the parameters for typing speed and correctness (percentage of typing accuracy).
We can also customize the number of lines that can be typed in a particular level.
From the main menu, select Settings and click Configure KTouch.
The Configure – KTouch dialog box appears.
From the left panel of the Configure – KTouch dialog box, click Training Options.
The right panel now displays the various 'Training Options'.
Let’s set the upper limit for the Typing speed, Correctness and Workload.
Under Limits to increase a level, let us:
set the Typing Speed to 120 characters per minute, Correctness to 85%.
Finally let’s set Workload to 1.
This means that we need to complete only one line in each level.
We then will automatically move to the next level.
If you want to complete the training for a level before you proceed to the next level, check the "Complete whole training level before proceeding" box.
Let’s set the lower limit for the Typing speed and Correctness.
Under Limits to decrease a level, let us:
set the Typing Speed to 60 characters per minute and Correctness to 60.
Let’s check the box Remember level for next program start.
Click Apply. Click OK.
Changes we made are applied only when we start a new session again.
Click Start New Session and select Keep Current Level.
Let’s start typing again.
Notice that initially the speed is 0. It increases or decreases as we type.
Click Pause Session. When we pause the typing speed remains at the same count.
Let us resume typing.
As the speed drops below 60, notice that the red circle next to Speed is glowing.
This indicates that speed has fallen below the lower limit, that is 60, set for the speed.
Now, type the number 4 that is not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The 'Student’s Line' turns red.
The percentage of the Correctness drops too.
Can you see the spaces between set of characters or character given in the 'Teacher’s Line'?
Now, I shall not press the Space bar after this word.
The 'Student’s Line' has turned red again!
This means the spaces too must be typed in correctly.
Let us complete typing an entire line in the student’s line and then press Enter.
The Level has changed to 3!
Why does the level change to 3? This is because we have set the Workload to 1.
Therefore, when we complete one line for Level 2 and press Enter, we move to the next level.
Notice that the new characters are displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
Do you want to know the scores of our typing session?
Click Lecture Statistics. The Training statistics dialogue box appears.
Let’s click on the "tabs" and see what each of them indicate.
Click on Current Training Session.
This displays the general statistics details, rate of typing, accuracy of typing and details of the characters that you need to concentrate on.
The Current Level Statistics tab displays details similar to the one displayed in the Current Training Session tab.
The Monitor Progress tab displays a graphical representation of the progress of your typing.
Let us close this dialogue box.
You can also create your own "shortcut keys".
What are shortcut keys?
Shortcut keys are combinations of two or more keys which can be pressed from the keyboard, instead of using the menu options.
Let us configure a shortcut key to view Lecture Statistics.
From the main menu, click Settings > Configure Shortcuts.
The Configure Shortcuts – KTouch dialogue box appears.
In the Search box enter Lecture Statistics.
Click Lecture Statistics. Select Custom and click None. The icon changes to Input.
Now, from the keyboard, press the Shift and A keys together.
Notice that the icon now displays the letters "Shift+A". Click OK.
Now, press the Shift and A keys together. The Training Statistics dialogue box appears.
Click Close to exit.
KTouch also allows you to configure toolbars.
Let us say we want to display the Quit Ktouch command as an icon.
From the main menu, click Settings and click Configure Toolbars.
The Configure Toolbars – KTouch dialogue box appears.
In the left panel, from the list of option, select the Quit icon. Double-click on it.
The icon is moved to the right panel.   Click Apply and then click OK.
The Quit icon is now displayed on the KTouch window.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on KTouch.
In this tutorial, we learnt how to modify the training level, monitor the speed, and accuracy of typing.
We also learnt to configure keyboard short cuts and toolbars.
Under Configure KTouch, change the Workload to 2.
Check the "Complete whole training level before proceeding" box.
Now, open a new typing session and practice typing.
Finally, check your Lecture Statistics.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to catalog Serial subscriptions.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to catalog Serial subscriptions.
To practice this tutorial, you should have: Koha installed on your system.
If not, please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website.
Before we begin, let us understand- What are Serials module?
Serials module is used for managing subscription of-
Magazines and Periodicals   that are published periodically.
In this demo, I am going to catalog a serial publication -
Volume-57,
To do so, login with the Superlibrarian username and password.
On the Homepage, click on Cataloging.
Then click on +New record.
A new page Add MARC record opens.
Let us proceed to fill in the details below.
Notice that there are a few mandatory fields on this page.
Interestingly, Koha auto-generates values for a few mandatory fields.
Among the range of tabs from 0 to 9, we will start with tab zero.
Click inside the field for 000,  LEADER. By default, Koha shows this value.
Next, click inside the field for 005 DATE AND TIME OF LATEST TRANSACTION.
Koha auto generates this value  for my machine.
You will see a different value on your interface.
I will skip the fields for 006 and 007.
When 008 FIXED-LENGTH DATA ELEMENTS--GENERAL INFORMATION is clicked,
Next, go to the tab 022 ISSN.
Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 022 question mark.
Note that when you click on the ? (question mark) then the entire MARC 21 Bibliographic format for the respective tag 022 opens up.
Here, both the indicators are undefined.
Now, let us go back to the Koha interface.
So, I will skip the two blank boxes.
Next, locate the sub-field ‘a’ International Standard Serial Number.
Enter an 8 digit Journal ISSN.
However, you have to add the ISSN of the Journal that you have chosen to catalog.
I will skip the rest of the fields.
You may consider filling these fields as per the requirement of your library.
Next, go to the tab 040 CATALOGING SOURCE.
Here, both the indicators are undefined.
So, I will leave the two blank boxes as they are.
Go to sub-field c, Transcribing agency.
Type the name of the Institute/University or the Department here.
I will type IIT Bombay.
Now come to the tab 082 DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION NUMBER.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Drupal People Management.
In this tutorial, we will learn about:People Management and Setting up specific task-based roles.
To record this tutorial, I am using:Ubuntu Linux Operating System, Drupal 8 and Firefox Web browser.You can use any web browser as per your choice.
Let's learn about People management.
I have switched back to the ZIRCON theme and we will keep this theme for the rest of this tutorial.
People management is really very important.
It’s actually very complicated to get right.
We have to do it just once, but correctly.
Let’s click on People.
People in Drupal are given roles that have permissions.
Through the permission structure, Drupal allows us to control what people can see and what people can do.
Now it’s important to remember a few things here.
Remember that you are user no.1 - that is the super user.
Nobody can change your permissions.
There is a user below that’s called ADMINISTRATOR.
Administrators are generally given permissions to manage the entire site.
But still they are not as high as User No.1.
Authenticated Users are logged in people who have certain rights.
Lastly, Anonymous Users are visitors who are not logged in.
Usually, Anonymous Users can just view the content that’s not protected and do nothing else.
Another important thing to remember is, to set up roles that are specific to the tasks on the site.
Suppose we have a summer intern who is only allowed to update Events, not Articles or Pages or User Groups.
This summer intern needs to have his/her own role so that you can manage the permissions.
We will set that up shortly.
For now, let’s click on Permissions tab.
Scroll down slowly and see what’s available.
The list gets longer and longer and longer -for every Content type we add, for every Module we add and
for every View we build.
People management in Drupal is about what people can do.
Next, we will add a new role, give it some permissions and test it out.
Let’s click Roles.
Let’s add a new role here called "Summer Intern".
Drupal will give it a machine name, as always.
Click Save.
Now we have a new role Summer Intern, that doesn’t have any permissions yet.
I like to move my roles in the order of ability or permissions.
It just helps me to see the roles in a logical order - who has what permissions.
Let’s click Save order.
Now we need to give our new role some permissions.
Click on Permissions tab.
We can see that this page is the overview of everybody’s permissions.
Let’s go back for a second by clicking on Roles tab.
Click on Summer Intern and select Edit permissions.
Now, we just see the permissions for the Summer Intern and it’s a little bit easier.
Scroll down and locate the Content type called Events - it’s about half way down for me.
Here, let’s say the Summer Intern can- Create new events,Delete only their own events and Edit only their own events.
What we’re not going to allow the Summer Intern to do is -Delete other people’s content, Delete revisions, Edit any other events that they’ve not created.
We are also not going to allow them to revert back to an old version.
We will give our editors those particular powers.
This is a pretty limited role.
Now, scroll all the way down to the bottom and click Save permissions.
And notice again -they can’t edit views,
they can't edit books, they can’t even post comments without somebody approving it.
So, this is a very limited role. The third step is to add a person.
We have set up the roles, added the permissions.
Now, let’s add a user. And here, we can give a fake email address.
It just has to be in a valid format.
I’ll just say intern@email.com because we’re not going to actually email them.
In Username, we’ll type "Sam" and we’ll use 'sam' as the password also.
It is a very insecure password. But it is fine for now, as this is a local machine.
We need to change the Status to Active
and he should have the Summer Intern role.
We can add a picture if we want to.
For now, we will turn off the Personal contact form. Because summer interns don’t need to be contacted.
Lastly, click Create new account.
The success message tells us that our account is created for Sam and no email has been sent.
So, now on our user list, we can see Sam.
When we set up new users like this, a very important thing to do is to test.
Let’s logout and login as Sam and test.
But the problem is - what happens if Sam was a real user and he decides to change his password.
We can not just randomly change other people’s password when we need to test their accounts. That’s not ethical.
There is a fantastic module at drupal.org/project/masquerade.
The Masquerade module allows us to do exactly what it says - masquerade as somebody else.
We can masquerade as the Summer Intern to find out if we have set their permissions correctly.
I have already installed Masquerade module in my machine.
Please install it in your machine also.
You may refer to the tutorial “Adding functionalities using Modules” for installing new modules.
For your convenience, the Masquerade module is provided in the Code Files link in the webpage of this tutorial.
Please download and install it.
Once it is installed, you can see a new link Unmasquerade in the login area.
To use the Masquerade, go to the People page.
Click on the Edit drop-down of the user Sam and select Masquerade as.
Notice that as soon as we Masquerade as Sam, the toolbars are gone.
This is because the role of the user Sam does not have permissions to use administrator toolbars.
When we click on Add content, the only thing we are able to create is an event. So far so good.
If we click on Our Drupal Manual and then on Installing Drupal, we can’t edit.
There are no tabs.
Same thing if we go to the Forums.
And once again, we cannot edit.
We are able to leave a comment. But it won’t be automatically approved.
Once again, we can click on an event but we are not able to edit it or delete it.
It looks like our permissions are right.
Now, go back to the administrator role by clicking on Unmasquerade link.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about People Management and adding a new user.

Welcome to the 2nd part of our Change Password tutorial. In the last  one, we learnt how to check if our forms were submitted.
We’ve got our data values in here.
Please remember that inside our database, our passwords are encrypted.
So, as soon as these fields are coming in,  I will encrypt them into an md 5 hash.
Make sure you put the brackets.
What I have highlighted here is our parameter.
So, here we will have our "md5" encrypted passwords.
We will need to check this field to see whether they exist or not.
At the moment when we submit our form, we see that nothing really happens.
First I will say “check password against db” and then we have to connect to our database.
We have already connected to the database in several of these pages- like the login page.
You can put this into a separate file, say, “include” and include "connect .php”  with your one time login script in, so that you don’t have to keep typing it.
But for our tutorial's sake, I will keep typing it over and over again because this is a good way to learn.
We type here - "$connect = mysql_connect()".
And we will be connecting to our "local host" database, with my username as "root" and my password as nothing; I am going to select my database.
So, that is “phplogin” which is here.  Let's go there and you can see it here.
Our table is "users" which we can use later on.
Next we will create a query to get the passwords.
So I will type “ $query get” which is equal to mysql.......... "mysql_query" and here we will type "SELECT password" - We need to ascertain the password from the database "users".
You can see here.  This is the "users" table.
Then we type “WHERE username is equal to $user”. This is our session variable holding our user’s 'username'.
So, what we are doing is we are selecting our password hash from this table where the "username' is equal to the session name and that is equal to “Alex”.
So, that should be a successful query.  And you can type at the end or die "Query didn’t work”" - some error message.
You can be a bit imaginative with these error messages and type what you like.
Same here.  You can say or die.  You can add your own error message in here but to save time I am not going to, right now.
Now, we will use this slightly differently, before we use the while function to loop through every record in the database.
I was informed about this method through a comment someone posted.  I will say "$row = mysql_fetch_associative".  And that's "$query get".
We will set “$old password db” which is a new variable name. Don’t mistake this with the '$old password' that has been submitted.
Our old password inside the database will be equal to our '$row'.
Remember, this creates an array.
So, this value is  "password" because inside our database, this is “password” here. You need to use the labels.
So, from here on we can check our passwords.
Checking our old passwords and our new passwords is just a simple if statement.
Let's type - if the 'old password' is equal to the 'old password inside the database'.
These are both 'md5 hashes' because we converted them into an md5 hash earlier.
So, if they are equal then we’ll run a block of code, otherwise we’ll kill the page and say ” Old password doesn’t match!”.
So here, assuming we’ve got through the first stage of our validation, we checked the old password with the old password in the database. Now we need to  check our two new passwords.
So this is just as simple as typing if '$new password' is equal to '$repeat new password' then we can write a block of code; otherwise we can just kill the page and say “ New passwords don’t match!”.
So here, this is “success” and then we’ll say “change password in database”.
So now what I’ll do is echo out “success” and I’ll go back to my page.
I’ll type my password wrong on purpose. So, I’ll just type this.
My new password I’ll type as "abc" and then clicking on Change password, we get the message "Old password doesn’t match!".
If I type "abc" as my old password which it is and "123" as my new password and random letters in the next, we should get.....Oh "Old password doesn’t match!"
Let's go back and check the code.   Old password....row - password.... 'query get'...
And, what we can do here to debug is: just say echo '$old password db' with a break on the end and just say echo 'old password' with another break.
What we can do now is, run the script again. So, old password equals "abc", new password equals "123" and then random letters.
Okay, so let’s compare these. They both look the same to me, so we can see that we’ve got a problem here.
Again let's check the code.  Checking for the spellings.
Ok. I just found out the problem. If I go back to my database here, we see that I had added in this value myself and I had created this space at the end of this - you can see it highlighted in blue - I’ll just get rid of that quickly and I’ll come back to my page.
I’ll login again as usual and quickly change my password, I’ll put my old password in correctly and random text for my two new passwords.
You can see that my two new passwords don’t match.
We've echoed this out already, so now we can delete this.
Assuming my passwords do match, let me echo this success message.
So let’s just delete these. I put them for debugging.
I’ll just type in my old password, my new passwords 123 and 123, click Change password and we’ve got success.
So, I apologize for that last slip-up there.
So in the 3rd part of this tutorial, we will continue with updating the user's password and just making sure everything’s working properly.
Thanks for watching. This is Joshwa Mathew, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.

We have two objectives in this tutorial.
The first one is to explain how to create tables using the tabular environment; the second objective is to explain how to include tables in latex documents using the table environment.
A similar technique can be used to include figures also.
We have seen how to create the title page,
this one has title, author information, and Creative Commons, copyright information as explained in the tutorial on equations.
Let me delete these commands.
Let me do that here.
In the first line, the entries are "mango" and "mixed".
Two reverse-slashes indicate next line.
"Jackfruit".
"Kolli hills".
"Banana".
"Green".
Let me end this tabular environment.
Let me compile this.
And, this has appeared here.
We get the 3 by 2 table. There are three rows and 2 columns.
The two columns are right aligned as indicated by the 'r r' character.
To separate the two columns, we introduce a vertical line between the column alignment characters.
Save it,Compile it.
You see that a vertical line has come.
If you want vertical lines at the end also, put them at appropriate places.
Let me put them, save them, compile them.
So, these have come.
As a matter of fact, we can put more vertical lines.
Let me put one more vertical line at the beginning.
There you are! A second line has come.
See there are two vertical lines.
We will now try different alignments.
Let's put a ‘c’ here to say that the second column should be center aligned.
This is center aligned now.
Let us make the first column left aligned.
Right now, it is right aligned; let me make them left aligned.
'l',Save
Compile.
Now it is left aligned.
We will now separate the rows with horizontal lines as follows.
Let's put a h-line here.
Let us see what happens when we do that.
It puts a top line.
If I put another h-line here,
see a line has come,So, let me complete this.
Let me put h-line.
Here I have to put a break line with two reverse slashes and then h-line.
H-line begins from the beginning of the sentence.
So, now I have completed the horizontal lines.
Now, let us add three more columns and one more row.
So, what I do is- I come here, and 'c' , 'c', 'r'.
So, I have added three more columns, first two of them are center aligned the third one is right aligned.
And then here I want to say:
"fruit"
"type"
"number of units"
"cost per unit"
"cost rupees"
h-line.
So, "mixed"
"20"
"75" rupees
"1500" rupees.
"Jackfruit"
"10" of them
"50" rupees
"500" rupees.
"Banana green"
"10" dozens
"20" rupees a dozen and "200" rupees total.
So, let’s see whether we can compile this.
So, it has created the table.
See the need for right alignment, this is.. so that we can add these numbers.
Suppose, that we want to split the columns in two.
For example, here these two columns have fruit details and these three have cost calculations.
So, this is done with the help of what is known as multi-column command.
Let me do it as follows.
multi-column
take 2
center-aligned
Fruit Details.
First two are over then I put a tab to indicate the next column.
Go to the next line.
multi-column, three, also to be center-aligned.
Cost within braces – cost calculations
slash h-line.
So, there you are.
The first two have the title "Fruit details", the next three have the title "Cost calculations".
I don’t have the vertical lines that’s because I didn’t tell latex to do that. So let’s do that.
Here, I want two vertical lines, here I want one vertical line.
Before this, I already have the line here, so let me just put this here.
See what happens.
So, now the vertical lines have also come.
Because these 2 and 3 are single character arguments its possible to write them without braces.
Okay, same thing works.
Sometimes it is necessary to draw horizontal lines between only a few columns.
So, we explain this as follows.
Let me split this "mango" instead of "mixed", let me call this "Malgoa"
and then "18" kilograms
"50" kilograms.
Let me delete this.
okay,And here, let me say that it is "Alfanso"
"2" dozens
"300" rupees a dozen, and a total of 1500.
Let’s see what happens when I save this. Compile this.
So, I’ve got this. What happens is, this line comes here and as well as here and I don’t want this and this. So, this is taken care of by saying instead of this horizontal line, I want a 'c' line and between the columns 2 and 4.
So, I should have done this here.
So let me put this back here.
H-line here.
c-line 2 to 4.
Okay, so now I have the line between columns two and four only.
So, this central line has split the mangoes into two of the most popular mangoes in India.
We will conclude this example, conclude this table with a last row.
Let me total up as follows.
multi-column four
2 vertical lines, right-aligned
vertical separator
Total cost
Rupees.
Close this.
Next tab
2200
h-line.
So there you are.
So, this was the table that we started with at the beginning of this tutorial.
How do we work with the tables created using the tabular environment?
Latex treats the entire table created using the tabular environment as a single object.
For example- if you write,
This is
an
example
"This is an example table".
What happens is this table gets sandwiched between these two. "This is an" example to, "example table".
This table appears in a running sentence.
It is possible to include tables using a centre environment.
A more common approach is to include it in the table environment. As we show now.
begin
table
Close this.
So, what happens is now ‘this is an example table’.
This statement comes separately and whatever that appeared between this ‘begin’ and ‘end’ table have been placed separately as a table.
In other words, even though the table appears in between some text, it has been put separately.
This is not centered.
What I can do is, give a command here called ‘centering’
to place this at the center of the document.
Let us now create a caption.
Table caption is put before the table.
Let me put a caption here.
"Caption cost of fruits in India".
So, the caption has come.
This is too close; I want to leave a small space.
Let me do that by giving through this v-space command 1 ex.
That is the space equivalent of the ‘x’ character.
So, I have left this vertical space.
So, now it looks okay.
By default, Latex places tables at the top of the page.
This placement is done automatically.
The table is ‘floated’ to the next available slot.
To explain this, let me cut and paste some text from the bottom of this document.
Let me delete this.
Let me delete this.
Alright.
Now, there is some write up about these fruits.
Go to the top of this.
Paste it here.
Compile it.
So, as before, the table got placed at the top of this page.
Let me put some more text here.
Four copies.
So, now what has happened is-
this table has been floated to the second page and
there is nothing else here. So, it has been placed at the middle of this page.
Let me put one more copy of this, some more text.
So, now what has happened is-
this is the title page, this is the text page, the table has been floated, it has gone to the top of this page.
As in equations, we can also create labels and use them for referencing.
you give this command below the caption command.
You have to give it below the caption command because it is the caption command that creates the table number.
For example, here 'table 1' has been created automatically by this caption command.
If you put the label after this, this label will refer to the number created using the caption command.
So label
fruits.
So, let me just go back and say
let me add this line here.
The cost of these fruits is shown in Table reference, you have to give the label, it should be the same as this.
tab fruits
Let me compile it.
So there it is,On first compilation, this variable is not assigned.
So let me re-compile it, so now I have got this.
We can create a list of tables automatically
as we explain now.
After the make title, suppose we want this list of tables - one word, is the command.
So what has happened is
it has created a list of tables.
Typically one would have to compile twice to make sure the table number comes correct.
Here it comes, the table according to this list is in page two but we know that it is in page 3.
So, this is in page 3.
So, let's go back and compile it once more.
So there you are, it is in page 3.
So this has been explained before.
Alright, this comes to the end of this part in which we explained the tables.
We will now explain how to create figures using the command called include graphics.
So for this, we need to include this package called graphicx.
Okay! Suppose I go to the bottom of this,
and say, the command is as follows. begin figure
include graphics
width equals.
I have a file called iitb.pdf.
There you are.
I include it here with the width of this figure coming out to be equal to that of the line width.
Let me end this figure.
Compile this.
There you are.
So, it has also been put at the top of this page.
Alright! What I will do is, let me just, so this is for if I want to use the entire line width .
Suppose I want to use point 5, that is half a line width,
then it has been made small.
And note that it has been left aligned.
As in the table, I can say centering
which will center this at the middle.
I can also create a caption; figure captions are created after the figure is included.
Golden Jubilee logo of IIT Bombay.
Okay, as before I can create a label and refer to it using the ref command.
I can also make this list of figures appear along with the list of tables.
So, suppose I want list of figures also.
I will compile it.
I will compile it twice.
and there it is. List of figures also comes automatically.
All the figure captions will appear here.
There is one last thing that I want to show you here.
That is how to rotate these figures.
This is done by the angle option.
Suppose, angle... I want to rotate by 90 degrees.
So, let's go to this figure.
Let’s compile this.
So, this has been rotated by 90 degrees.
Rotate it by 'minus 90'.
Alright. So, this is the way to include the figures.
Here, I am assuming that iitb.pdf is available.
The beginners of latex should compile after every few changes to the source document and make sure that what they have entered is correct.
Thank you for listening to this tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Indexing and Slicing Data Frames.
Extract rows or columns from a data frame
Create a subset from a data frame
Retrieve data using double square brackets
To understand this tutorial, you should have knowledge about
Data frames in R
R script in RStudio and
How to set Working directory in RStudio
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.2.3
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use the data frame CaptaincyData.csv and a script file mydataframe.R.
Download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to the folder myProject on my Desktop.
I have also set this folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
Let us open the script mydataframe.R in RStudio.
For this, click on the script mydataframe.R.
Script mydataframe.R opens in Rstudio.
Here, we have declared a variable captaincy to store and read CaptaincyData.csv.
Also, View function is being used to see the contents of the file.
Remember, you may also use equal to sign in place of less than symbol followed by hyphen.
However, we recommend less than symbol followed by hyphen.
For this, there is a shortcut in RStudio.
Suppose we want to assign a value of 2 to a variable named testvar.
In the Console window, type testvar and then press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Then type 2 and press Enter.
Let us get back to the Source window.
Run the script mydataframe.R by clicking on the Source button.
Now let us extract the contents of the third row of the captaincy data frame.
Click on script mydataframe.R
In the Source window, type captaincy
Type capt and press Enter to make the variable captaincy autocomplete. Now within square brackets 3 followed by comma. And press Enter.
Press Enter key at the end of every command.
Remember one of the most important features of RStudio include intelligent auto-completion of function names, packages, and R objects.
We use a comma within square brackets when we wish to extract a row.
Save the script and execute the current line by pressing Ctrl+Enter keys.
The third row of the captaincy data frame is seen in the Console window.
Now, let us run the same command without a comma.
In the Source window, type captaincy then within square brackets 3.
Save the script and run this line only, as shown earlier.
The contents of the third column of the data frame, are displayed on the Console window.
So, to extract a column, we shouldn’t use a comma within the square brackets.
When we extract data using row number or column number, it is known as numeric indexing.
In the Source window, click on the captaincy data frame.
Let us now extract the contents of second and third rows of the captaincy data frame.
To retrieve more than one row, we use a numeric index vector. Click on the script mydataframe.R
In the Source window, type the following command and press Enter.
c function is being used to concatenate the second and third rows.
Save the script and execute the current line.
The second and third rows of captaincy data frame are seen in the Console window.
In the Source window, click on the captaincy data frame.
Now, we’ll find who has played 25 matches from the played column of captaincy data frame.
Extracting this type of information is known as logical indexing.
Click on the script mydataframe.R
In the Source window, type captaincy
Within square brackets captaincy dollar sign played equal to equal to 25 comma. Press Enter.
Remember, dollar sign allows you to extract elements by name.
Please note that there is no space between the two equal to signs.
Save the script and execute the current line.
The details of captain Dravid are shown in the Console window.
In the Source window, click on the captaincy data frame.
Now let us learn how to get the values of any particular attribute for all the players.
We will fetch the names of all the captains.
For this, we need to know the values in the first column.
Click on the script mydataframe.R
In the Source window, type captaincy and within square brackets 1.
Please note that I have not used a comma inside the square brackets.
Save the script and execute the current line.
The names of the captains are seen in the Console window.
Usually we use column names instead of column numbers.
To know the names of the captains, type captaincy.
Within square brackets inside double quotes names
Save the script and execute the current line.
Names of the captains are shown in the Console window.
Extracting data by column names is known as name indexing.
Clear the Console window by clicking on the broom icon.
In the Source window, click on the captaincy data frame
Now let us view the names of the captains along with the number of matches they have won.
Click on the script mydataframe.R
In the Source window, type the following command and press Enter.
Here c function is used to concatenate names and won.
Observe that names and won have been written within double quotes.
Save the script and execute this line.
The names of captains and the number of matches won are seen in the Console window.
Now let us extract a subset from captaincy data frame.
We will create a subset of captains, who have won more than 30% of their matches.
This is called slicing a data frame.
In the Source window, click on the captaincy data frame.
Please note that there is a column named victory in the captaincy data frame.
For required subset of captains, their victory should be greater than 0.3.
For this subset, we shall only show the
names
number of matches played
number of matches won
Click on the script mydataframe.R
I will resize the Source window.
In the Source window, type the following command
Now, press Enter after the comma followed by 0 point 3.
You can press Enter after a comma for better visibility.
The select parameter is used to select the required columns, names, played, and won.
In the Source window, type print within parentheses subData .
Save the script and run these two lines.
I am resizing the Console window to see the output properly.
The subData is shown in the Console window.
In the Source window, click on the captaincy data frame.
Finally, let us learn how to extract a particular entry from some column of a data frame.
We will extract the third value in the fourth column of the captaincy data frame.
Click on the script mydataframe.R.
In the Source window, type captaincy within double square brackets 4 within single square brackets 3.
Save the script and execute the current line.
The expected value 14 is seen in the Console window.
For more information on indexing and slicing data frames, please refer to the Additional materials section on this website.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to:
Extract rows or columns from a data frame
Create a subset from a data frame
Retrieve data using double square brackets
We now suggest an assignment.
Create a subset from captaincy data frame with the captains who have played more than(>) 20 matches and lost less than(<) 14 matches.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Ohm's law and its applications.
At the end of this tutorial you will be able to:
Verify Ohm’s Law.
Solve a numerical based on Ohm’s law.
Draw a graph to find the relation between voltage and current.
Solve a numerical based on series and parallel combination and
Calculate the value of current in the circuit.
Here I am using,
Firefox Web Browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For the pre-requisite tutorials please visit this site.
In this tutorial we will use
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
Right click on the ohmslaw_en.htm file.
Ohm’s Law App opens in the browser.
The App shows a simple circuit containing one resistor.
Green panel has two yellow buttons for resistance and two blue buttons for voltage.
Click on Increase resistance button.
Notice that as we increase the resistance, ammeter shows decrease in the current.
This increase in resistance, decrease the current in the circuit.
The value of current decreased from 0.03 Ampere to 0.02 Ampere.
Click on the Increase voltage button.
Change in voltage is shown by the voltmeter connected in the circuit.
The maximum voltage of a circuit is 10 V.
Click on the Maximal voltage drop down.
Here we can see various ranges for the maximum voltage.
We can vary the voltage between these measuring ranges.
From the Maximal voltage drop down select 100 V.
Note that we can vary voltage between 1 to 100 V.
Click on the Increase voltage button continuously.
Notice that the voltage increases in the steps of 10 V.
When voltage crosses the maximum voltage range, circuit prompts Maximum exceeded.
Note that the Maximal amperage range is 100 mA.
So when the current in the circuit exceeds 100 miliAmp, circuit shows Maximum exceeded below the ammeter.
Let us change the Maximal amperage to 300 miliAmp.
Click on the Maximal amperage drop down.
Select 300 milliampere from the drop down.
Now let us calculate current in the circuit using Ohm’s law.
Scroll down the screen.
Here the App has stated the Ohm’s law.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to restart the App.
Let us solve this numerical.
Please pause the video and read the numerical.
First let us change the values of the parameters according to the numerical.
For that we have to convert the value of current to milliampere.
1 Ampere = 1000 miliAmpere
So, 0.03 Ampere = 30 miliAmpere
Next from the Maximal amperage drop down select 30 miliAmpere.
Default value of resistance is 200 ohms.
Let us calculate the value of voltage using the formula.
Substitute the values of current and resistance into the formula.
The calculated value of voltage is 6 V.
It is same as the value shown in the App.
Let us find the relation between voltage, current and resistance using a graph.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to restart the App.
From the Maximal voltage drop down select 100 volts.
From the Maximal amperage drop down select 1 Ampere.
Next click on  Increase voltage button.
We can click on Increase voltage button to get the value of voltage in steps of 10 Volts.
Observe the change in the current as we change the voltage.
Now make a tabular column to note the values of voltage and current.
Go to the interface and check the value of current for 10 Volts.
The value is 0.05 Ampere.
Again click on Increase voltage button.
Note the value of current at 20 Volts in the tabular column.
Similarly I have noted the values of current in the table.
Here I have drawn the graph of current v/s voltage.
The graph is linear.
Voltage is directly proportional to current in a metallic conductor.
Here straight line shows the constant of proportionality, that is resistance.
Make a tabular column to note the values of voltage and current.
Change the voltage in the steps of 100 Volt.
Draw the graph and explain your observation.
Let us open the next App.
Open Combinations of Resistor App in a similar way as we opened Ohm’s Law App.
Combinations of Resistor App opens in the browser.
Here the App shows a simple circuit. It consists of a resistance and a battery.
Here we can see Voltage of the battery  and Resistance text boxes.
We can change the values of voltage and resistance using these text boxes.
The maximum limit of Voltage of the battery is 1000 Volts.
The maximum limit of Resistance is 1000 ohms.
Click on Reset button to get the default values.
In this App we will learn about series and parallel combinations of resistances.
To add resistor in series click on Add resistor in series button.
Notice that the added resistor is in series with the original resistor.
It also has the same resistance value, 100 ohms.
We can change the value of the selected resistor in the Resistance text-box.
Change the value of Resistance to 50 ohms.
Here we can see the values of Voltage, Amperage and Resistance of the circuit.
At the bottom of the green panel there are two check-boxes for meters.
Click on the Voltage check box.
Observe that voltmeter is connected to the resistor which is selected by default.
Uncheck the Voltage check-box.
Click on other resistance in the circuit.
Again click on Voltage check-box.
Now the voltmeter is connected to the selected resistance.
Next click on Amperage check-box to see the value of current.
Note that ammeter is connected in series and voltmeter is connected in parallel.
Ammeter is a device of lower resistance value.
So it allows current to pass through it.
Hence it is connected in series.
On the other hand voltmeter is a device with high resistance.
If we connect it in series it will resist the flow of current in the circuit.
That is why it is connected in parallel to allow the current to pass through it.
Click on the Reset button.
Change the value of Resistance to 250 ohms.
Next click on Add resistor in series  to add 2 more resistances.
Remember that we can only use three resistors in series.
Click and move the cursor on the resistors in the circuit.
This is the value of equivalent resistances in series.
Now let us know how to calculate the series and parallel resistances.
Next click on Add resistor in parallel  button.
Note that a resistor of 250 ohms is added parallelly to the series resistances.
Again click and move the cursor over the resistances.
Here the value of equivalent resistance is 188 ohms.
Let us see how the App has calculated the value of equivalent resistance.
The three resistance are in series combination, so we will add these resistances.
This gives the value as 750 ohms.
This 750 ohms resistance is connected in parallel with a 250 ohms resistance.
To calculate parallel combination we use this formula.
We will substitute the value of R1 as 750 ohms and R2 as 250 ohms.
I have solved the equation and got the value as 187.5 ohms.
Note that the calculated value is comparable to the observed value.
Let us solve a numerical based on series combination.
Please pause the video and read the numerical.
Now according to the numerical let us form a circuit on the interface.
Click on the Reset button.
Change the Voltage of the battery to 20 Volts and press Enter.
Enter 110 ohms in Resistance text-box and press Enter.
Click on Add resistor in series  button.
Change the value of selected resistor to 50 ohms.
Similarly add the third resistor and change the value to 180 ohms.
As the resistors are connected in series we will add the resistances.
So, the calculated value of resistance is 340 ohms.
Next to calculate the current in the circuit we will use the ohm’s law.
Rearrange the equation so as to calculate the value of current.
Substitute the value of voltage and equivalent resistance.
Click on the Amperage check-box to see the value of current.
As an assignment solve this numerical.
Let us summarize
Using these Apps we have,
Solved a numerical based on Ohm’s Law.
Drawn a graph to find the relation between voltage and current.
Solved a numerical based on series and parallel combination.
Calculated the value of current in the circuit.
These Apps were created by Walter-Fendt and his team.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Structures in C and C++.
What is a Structure.
Declaration of a structure.
Ubuntu Operating System  version 11.10,
Let us start with an introduction to Structure .
When one or more variables are grouped under one name, it is known as structure.
Structure is used to group different data into one object.
It is called as compound data-type.
It is used to group related information together.
Now we will see the syntax to declare a structure.
Here, the keyword struct tells the compiler that a structure is declared.
strcut_name is the name of the structure.
eg. struct employee;
You can give any name.
Now we will see how to declare a structure variable.
The syntax for this is:
struct struct_name and  struct_var;
struct_var is the variable of type struc_name.
example, struct employee addr;
addr is the variable of type employee.
Let us move on to our example.
I have already typed the program on the editor. So, let me open it.
Note that our file name is structure.c.
In this program we will calculate the total marks of three subjects using structure.
Here we have declared a structure as student.
Then we have declared three integer variables as English, maths and science.
Variables defined under the structure are called as members of the structure.
Here we have declared an integer variable 'total'.
Now we have declared a structure variable stud, stud is the variable of type student, it is used to access and modify the structure members.
Here we have modified the members
by assigning them values as 75, 70 and 65.
Here we calculate the total of three subjects.
This is our return statement.
Now click on Save .
Please open the terminal window by pressing
To compile, type gcc space structure.c space hyphen o space struct and press Enter.
To execute, type (dot slash)./struct. Press Enter.
Total is 210
Now we will execute the same program in C++ .
I will edit the same code.
First press Shift, Ctrl and  S keys simultaneously on the keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension .cpp
and click on save.
Let's change the header file as iostream.
Now include the using statement
and click on save.
Structure declaration in C++ is same as in C.
So, no need to change anything here.
At the end we will replace the printf statement with the cout  statement.
Delete the format specifier and (backslash n) \n.
Now delete the comma.
Type two opening angle brackets.
Here, delete the closing bracket
and type two opening angle brackets.
And within the double quotes, type \n (backslash n).
Now click on Save.
To compile, type g++ space structure.cpp space hyphen o space struct1 .
Here we have struct1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameters struct for the file structure.c .
To execute, type (dot slash) ./struct1. Press Enter.
Total is 210
You can see that the output is same as our C code.
Now let us go back to our slides.
We will summarize now. In this tutorial we learned,
Structure, Syntax of a structure
eg. struct struct_name;
To access members of a structure.
Eg: stud.maths = 75;
And to add the structure variables.
Eg: total = stud.eng + stud.maths + stud.science;
As an assignment, write a program to display  records of an employee.
Like name, address, designation, and salary.

Thank You for watching.
Hello friends. On behalf of CDEEP, IIT Bombay, I welcome you to this Spoken Tutorial.
This tutorial will explain the basics of how to edit a video using Windows Movie Maker.
Windows Movie Maker, a component of Microsoft Windows, is an editing software that is available for all the latest Windows versions – Me, XP or Vista.
If you do not have it on your PC, you can download it free of cost from the site 'www.microsoft.com/downloads'.
You will need a headset or speakers in order to listen to the audio of the movie clip.
Double-click on the Windows Movie Maker icon to run the program.
This will open an empty movie project on your screen.
Right at the top, you will see the Main Menu.
It contains many options which we will see in detail as we go along.
On the screen, you will see a Movie Tasks panel on the left hand side, a Collection panel in the middle and a Display panel on the right hand side.
If this is your first time using 'Windows Movie Maker', the Collection panel will be empty.
All the video clips, audio narrations and music files required for the project, when imported, will be displayed in the Collection panel.
If you have used the program before, the video and audio clips that were previously imported will appear in your Collection panel.
Select all the clips in the Collection panel by pressing Ctrl+A. Right-click on any clip and choose the Delete option.
Now that you have an empty movie project on your screen, you can import the files you require into Windows Movie Maker.
The Movie Tasks panel has several options – the main ones being Capture Video, Edit Movie and Finish Movie.
There is another option called the Movie Making Tips. Under Capture Video, you will see the option Import Video.
Click on it. Alternately, you can click on File in the Main menu and choose the Import into Collections sub-option.
Both choices will open the Import File Dialog-box. Here you can choose the video that you want to edit by specifying the path and the filename.
I will choose this video and click on the Import button. The selected video is being imported into the Collection panel.
If the video is too large then 'Windows Movie Maker' will automatically split it into smaller clips.
Select all of them by pressing Ctrl+A. Now right-click on any clip and choose Add to Timeline sub-option.
The clips will get added to the Timeline here, in the order they appear in the Collection panel.
If you want, you can also add the clips to the Timeline one by one by dragging the clip and dropping it on the Timeline. Let me put this back.
Vista users kindly note that Windows Movie Maker played in Windows Vista will not split the video into smaller clips.
It will be visible as a single clip in the collection panel. So again, right-click on the video clip and choose Add to Timeline option.
This will add the entire video to the Timeline in a single clip.
Notice the small blue rectangle at the top of the Timeline. This is called the frame-head.
It shows the current position of the video on the Timeline. By default, it is at the beginning of the Timeline.
Click on the first clip. The first frame or the beginning of the video will now be visible in the Display panel here.
When the video is being played, it will be visible in the Display panel. You will notice that there are VCR controls at the bottom of the Display panel.
Before I explain them, let me move the frame-head here.
The first button is to Play or Pause. When in the Play mode, the frame-head moves forward.
When in the Pause mode, the frame-head remains at the current position.
The second button is to Stop the playback.
When clicked, the playback will stop but the frame-head will go to the beginning of the Timeline.
Let me move the frame-head here. The third button is to Rewind one clip at a time.
Notice that the frame-head moves backward one clip at a time.
The sixth button is to Fast Forward one clip at a time.
Notice that the frame-head moves forward one clip at a time.
The fourth and fifth buttons are to Rewind and Fast Forward one frame at a time.
Notice that the frame-head is moving one frame at a time.
Now, this button here is called the Split button. It splits the clip into two clips at the current position - both the video and the audio clips.
Let me demonstrate this. I will move the frame-head here and click on the Split button.
Notice that the clip is now split into 2 clips at the current position. This is a powerful editing tool.
Now, let me explain the layout of the Timeline.
The Timeline is split into three categories – Video, Audio/Music and Title Overlay. Click on the plus-button next to Video.
This will expand the Video timeline and display the audio timeline therein. This is useful for dubbing purposes.
I have already explained about dubbing in another tutorial. You may want to watch it.
I will collapse the Video Timeline now by clicking on the 'minus' button next to Video.
Above the timeline, there are several icons that could help during the editing.
The Zoom-In button stretches the Video Timeline so that each frame of the video can be edited.
The Zoom-Out button collapses the Video Timeline so that you can view the whole video on the Timeline.
This button is the Rewind Timeline button.
Whenever you press it, the frame-head will move to the beginning of your video.
This is the Play Timeline button. Clicking on it will play the video in the display panel.
This Play button behaves exactly like the VCR control Play button.
For more information on the various features of Windows Movie Maker, the Movie Making Tips option in the Movie Tasks panel can be explored.
Now that I have explained the basic layout of the Windows Movie Maker screen, let’s come back to the Timeline and learn how to add or remove portions from a video.
I will zoom-in here. Once you have imported the video, play it from start to finish and make a note of the portions that you want to edit.
I want to remove a few seconds of video from here.
So, I will move the frame-head here and play the clip.
I will pause the playback here because this is the beginning of the part that I want to delete.
Now, I will click on the Split button.
Notice that the clip is now split at this position.
I will resume the playback and again pause at the end of the part that I want to delete.
Click on the Split button again. Notice that the clip is again split at this position.
I’ll just move it back, so you can see. Now, I will select the clip by clicking on it and press the Delete on the keyboard.
Notice that the next clip moves forward and joins the end of the previous clip.
Movie Maker does this on its own so that there is continuity in the video.
Always remember that whenever you delete a portion of a clip, both the video as well as the audio get deleted.
In this way, one can delete portions from a video.
Now, I will demonstrate how to add an extra clip to an existing video.
I have a small clip that I would like to include into my video.
So, I will import it into the Collection panel by clicking on Import Video.
This is the file that I want to import. So, I will select it and click on the Import button.
The clip is now being imported into the Collection panel.
The clip now appears in the Collection panel.
I will choose the clip by clicking on it and drag it to the position that I want it to appear on the Timeline.
I will release the mouse-button and my clip is added at the current position.
Please note that you can add a new clip at the beginning or at the end of another clip on the Timeline and not in between.
If you want to add in between then you will have to split the clip which is on the Timeline and add the new clip there.
In this way, one can add portions to a video. This procedure can be used to combine two or more videos.
Another feature that I would like to demonstrate is how one can extend the length of a clip or a portion of a clip.
This feature is particularly useful while dubbing.
Sometimes, the language in which one is dubbing may need more words to explain the same thing said in the original language of the video.
At such times, one may need to extend the time of the video clip to synchronize with the audio.
Select the portion of the video that you want to extend by following the procedure explained above about deleting portions.
I will demonstrate this. I will move the frame-head here. Split the video here. Play and pause, split the video again. Select the clipped part,  right-click and select Copy. Move the frame-head to the position where I want to paste it, right-click and select Paste.
Alternately, you can press Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste. In this manner, I have extended the clip by the required number of seconds.
It is always better to extend a clip to a longer duration and then cut off the portion that you do not require at the end of editing.
Ideally, choose a portion without mouse movement. Otherwise, there will be a repetition of the mouse movement in the pasted clip as well.
This could lead to confusion for the viewer.
So, that is something we need to keep in mind when we copy and paste to extend the video.
This covers the basic editing features of Windows Movie Maker.
So, use these features of Windows Movie Maker to edit your video.
As mentioned earlier, you may want to watch the tutorial on how to dub a video from one language into another.
Once you are conversant with basic editing and dubbing, you may want to watch yet another tutorial on how to add some cool video effects and transitions, titles or credits and audio or music to your video.
Viewers may also want to refer to our site- www.spoken-tutorial.org. This site contains all information related to the making, editing, dubbing of spoken tutorials for all operating systems.
Hope you find this information helpful. This is Nancy from CDEEP, IIT Bombay, signing off. Good-bye and thank you for watching.
Hello and welcome.  This is more of an explanation to video.
I will go through some of the common errors you might encounter when you are programming in PHP.
Most of them are self explanatory.
I would say a good 50% of errors that you encounter are when you either don't see something you have accidentally typed or you have missed out something.
Everyone makes such mistakes - missing either a semicolon or adding an extra bracket or something like that.
Now I have created a few pages here. These are some of the errors you are likely to encounter.
There are more. This list isn’t exhaustive.  This will just cover some of the basics.
I have got a context editor ready to take you through each error one by one.
So the first one I am going to explain is this "html".
I used a lot of html embedded in our echo command here.
If I try to run this page here, we get this error here.
It says Parse error and we get this message here.
You really need to look for these - "expecting either a comma or a semicolon".
It gives us a line number. So this will always return a line no. when we get one of these Parse errors.
It says here line 5.
So, if we come down to line 5 you can see here that is line 5 column 19 (Ln5, Col19); we get all the information.
Line 5 is here. Now there isn’t anything visually wrong with this.
The way php interprets a command like echo is that we get the starting point, our double quotes here and our ending point here. So this will be the start and this will be our end.
Now, what’s really happening here is that because we are embedding the 'html', we are using double quotes in between and this means that the echo command would be read as starting here and ending here.
I think I have explained this in my echo function tutorial.
Okay. So the reason that we are getting an error in this line is because this is the first occurrence of a double quotes where it shouldn’t be.
Now technically, php hasn’t picked this up; so this shouldn’t be here.
But what it was saying about expecting a semicolon was that when we end an echo, we use a semicolon. So, what it was looking for is that there.
But then, even after this, it becomes absolute rubbish.
So, what we need to do is use our single quotation marks instead.
Now if I were to save that, we will now get an error on line 6 because the error has come down to it, that changes to 6.
See, you know, you need to change something on line 6 or nearer line 6. You’ll see some of the other ones we will be doing; some don’t return the actual line error.
And there you go. So you have got that after running our 'html' code. There’s obviously no functionality. But we have covered that.
Okay. So the next one I'm going to do is the semicolon. This is one other common error.
We go back here and click on semicolon. We have got a parse error here "expecting a semicolon".
Now why are we expecting a semicolon? This code looks okay. We have got a variable here with "Alex".  We have another variable here with "Alex".
We are comparing these variables. We need double equals (==) in there.
If this condition is True, we will echo this message.
Now if we go here - line no. 9.
So obviously, this is a very simple code. If it were a bit more complex, you came to line 9 but this is in fact line 9.
Now looking at that, there is nothing wrong with line 9.
But in a way, there is something wrong with that line. What we have is the way php interprets the pages; it’s on a single line basis.
So the code we see here is the same as that.
That would actually compile and work but because this is down here and this is the same as up here, we are still expecting a semicolon after that.
If we do this, this is still a valid code. So, I have added a semicolon there, although to the human eye visually it should be there.
We can bring it down here. So, let me just re-run this code.
There you go. So we get a successful page.
Obviously if I were to put that up here, that would also be a valid code as would that.
So php doesn’t work on the basis that there’s an error on this line.
It usually says the current line can’t be run may be because of an error on previous line.
So, because of this error on this line without the semicolon, this line cannot run. Therefore the line has been returned as an error on line 9. You can see that there.
So that’s two basic errors that we have covered.
If you ever get things like that, just check and don’t necessarily check the line that the error has been returned on.
Check before, check after. No, not after but check before and see if you can fix anything.
Just scan through every single character if you have to.
I get a lot of emails from people who have made mistakes like that and I don’t mind helping people.
Feel free to ask but make sure you check your work once, twice or even thrice before you send me anything.
Okay. So, in the next parts we will cover the rest of the error pages. See you soon.  This is Evan Varkey, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project. (Script contributed by Antara Atrey)

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Biogas and its benefits.
In this tutorial, we will learn about biogas, how it is produced and its uses.
We will also learn in brief about the biogas plant.
So, what is biogas? Biogas is a gaseous fuel. It is a product of fermentation of remains of the bio-degradable organic waste.
The main component of biogas is Methane.
Biogas can be produced easily and for free, by using a biogas plant. This is what a family type biogas plant looks like.
Some of the benefits of using a biogas plant are listed as:
Installation of family type biogas plants in villages helps protect natural resources.
It also provides standard basic amenities to the rural population.
Biogas plants help reduce the drudgery of women, in collecting fuel wood from long distances.
It also helps in minimizing health hazards during cooking in smoky kitchens.
Once constructed, the lifespan of a biogas plant is approximately 25 years.
Biogas plants are easy to use and the maintenance is quite simple.
The raw materials used to produce biogas are- waste generated in the kitchen, like- vegetable and fruit peels, leftover food items, eggshells, bones etc.
Domestic wet waste like the water used for cleaning floors, spoilt milk or tea etc.
Plant materials like fallen leaves, flowers, stems etc.
We can also use waste generated on farms, solid waste of cattle, liquid waste of cattle and the solid and liquid sewage waste that goes into the toilets.
Let us briefly learn how biogas is generated.
This is the diagram of the family type Biogas plant.
What you see here is the mixing tank where we put the raw material.
The inlet pipe carries this raw material inside the Biogas plant.
And this is the digester tank where the biogas is generated due to fermentation of raw material.
It is also called as the compost tank. Here is the output valve from where the biogas is ejected out of the plant.
There is also an outlet pipe for the slurry.
The slurry collects in the slurry tank and can be taken into the fields, to be used as manure.
So, how much of space is required to build a family type biogas plant?
Typically, to build a family type biogas plant, we require 12 ft by 8 ft of land.
Now we will discuss about the budget for building a Biogas plant.
The minimum cost for building a biogas plant is from Rs 20,000 to Rs 23,000/-. This amount may however vary from place to place.
A few banks provide loans to build a biogas plant.
The government also provides subsidies on completion of biogas plant.
The government gives extra subsidies for the tribal areas through Zilla parishad and Gram Panchayat.
Additional subsidy of Rupees 1200 is given if the biogas plant input is connected to the toilet.
The details of the cost of building the biogas plant,
how to apply for the loan in a bank and the subsidy will be covered in other tutorials, in the same series.
Now let's see the benefits of biogas.
The use of biogas and biogas plant are extremely beneficial. Biogas is an eco-friendly, non-polluting, renewable source of energy.
Biogas is a very good replacement for LPG, kerosene and firewood.
It can be obtained free of cost, once the biogas plant is built.
Biogas plant helps in human and cattle waste management, agricultural waste management as well as kitchen and domestic waste management.
It also decreases soil and water pollution and plays a critical role in preventive healthcare.
Let us look at some of the time-saving benefits.
By using biogas, we can save a lot of time which is otherwise spent in collecting firewood.
Use of biogas is also very good for health as no smoke is produced.
Also, it is very hygienic as there is no charcoal deposition on the walls of the cooking area. This usually occurs when firewood is used.
Next, we will learn what are the other by-products of the biogas plant.
We can get nutrient-rich natural manure from the slurry generated by the biogas plant.
The wet slurry waste can be directly used as manure in the fields.
The slurry can also be dried and powdered and stored for use, later in the fields.
The dried slurry powder can be sold as natural manure to farmers, fruit orchard owners  and nurseries in the big cities.
This manure can also be used to make organic fertilizers with the help of earthworms.
This is easily done with a technique known as vermicomposting.
Using this organic fertilizer in the fields will save a lot of money for the farmers.
And, this organic fertilizer can once again be sold and become a source of income for the family.
Generally, biogas generated by a family type biogas plant is used for cooking.
It can also be used to heat large quantities of water for bathing  and other purposes.
Some rural small-scale industries use biogas to supply heat in various processes.
Let’s now watch a testimonial from a biogas user family.
Hello, my name is Subhash Balachandra Madgowkar and this is my wife Shubdha.
There are four members in my family and we also have three cattle.
Earlier we used to go very far to the forest to collect firewood.
Sometimes we also used to purchase firewood. Now we have been using biogas for past 10 years.
Ever since using biogas, we don’t have to go to far off places to collect firewood. We don’t have to purchase firewood.
We don’t have to inhale smoke while cooking and the kitchen looks neat and tidy.
Biogas is easy to use and is sufficient for cooking for my entire family.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial we learnt about biogas, how it is produced and its uses.
We also learnt about the biogas plant, cost of building a biogas plant and benefits of using biogas.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Exception and error handling in PERL.
When an error occurs, Exception handling deviates the execution of a program from the normal execution path.
Error handling helps to recover the program, without terminating the application.
We can identify and trap an error in a number of ways. We will see few commonly used methods in Perl.
The warn function only raises a warning message without taking further action.
The die function immediately terminates the execution and displays the error message.
Let us understand the die function using a sample program which I have already saved.
Go to the terminal and type: gedit die dot pl ampersand and press Enter.
This is the code in 'die.pl' file. Let us understand the code now.
Here, we have defined a function divide which takes two input parameters
At the rate underscore (@_) is a special variable used to pass the parameter list to the function.
If the denominator is zero, the die function will quit the script.
It will also display the error message for the user to read. Else, it will print the output.
These are the function call statements.
The first two times, the function is executed because the second parameter is not zero.
The third time, the denominator value is zero. So, the die function is executed.
The last divide function will not be executed as the die function quits the script.
Press Ctrl + S to save the program.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl die dot pl and press Enter.
The output is displayed as shown here.
This is the error message we have given in the program, in the die statement.
Next, we will see how to use eval function in error handling.
eval function is used for handling run-time errors or exceptions.
For example, built-in errors such as out of memory, divide by zero or user defined errors.
The general syntax for eval function is shown here.
The dollar exclamation($!) special variable holds the error message, if any.
Otherwise, dollar exclamation( $!) holds an empty string.  That means it is evaluated as false.
Let us understand the eval function using a sample program.
Type: gedit eval dot pl ampersand and press Enter.
In the eval dot pl file, type the following code as displayed on the screen. Let me explain the code now.
Here, in our example,open FILE invokes the die statement, if it has trouble in opening a file “test.dat”.
Perl gives the system error message from the last eval block to the variable dollar exclamation( $!).
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl eval dot pl and press Enter.
The system error message is displayed as shown here.
Let us see another example. This time, we will see an error message returned from eval function using '$@' (dollar at the rate).
Let us switch back to the eval dot pl file.
Type the code as shown on the screen.
We are passing $total, $count as input parameters to the function average.
We have a possibility of getting an error if the count is zero.
Here, that is handled with the die statement.
The error message returned from eval is displayed using $@ ( dollar at the rate).
If not, it will print the Average value.
Press Ctrl +S to save the file.  Let us execute the program.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl eval.pl and press Enter.
The output is as shown here.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to:
As an assignment do the following.
Change permission of 'emp.txt' to READ only.
Note: Go through the relevant Linux spoken tutorials on the spoken tutorial website for change permission option.
Write a Perl program to open the 'emp.txt' file in WRITE mode and add few employee names to it.
Using "eval", print appropriate error message if open/write operation fails.
This is Nirmala Venkat from IIT Bombay, signing off. Thanks for watching.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Including files or modules in a PERL program.
In this tutorial, we will learn to use:
'do()' method: These are simple ways to include the source code from other files into the current script file.
Let us understand how to use do() method.
Open a new file in your text editor and name it as datetime dot pl.
In the datetime dot pl file, type the following code as displayed on the screen.
From here onwards, remember to press the Enter key after every command on the terminal.
The current date and time are stored in a variable dollar datestring.
Here, I have a function by name "msgThanks" which returns a “Thank you” message.
Next, let us look at another Perl program which will make use of this file datetime dot pl.
Open a new file in your text editor and name it as main dot pl.
In the main dot pl file, type the following code as displayed on the screen.
Here, the first line prints the welcome message.
'do()' method is called with the filename from where we want to use the code.
Current date and time are stored in the $datestring variable of datetime dot pl file.
And at the end, we call the msgThanks() function from the same file.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl main dot pl and press Enter.
Observe the output on the terminal.
Next, we will learn how to use require() method and use() method in a Perl program.
These methods are used -  when we have collections of subroutines   that can be used in multiple Perl programs.
use() method is used only for the modules.
It is verified at the time of compilation.
There is no need to give the file extension.
require() method is used for both Perl programs and modules.
It is verified at the run time.
One needs to give the file extension.
The syntax of use method is: use module name semicolon.
Perl modules are the files which end with '.pm' extension.
Re-usability of code is implemented through modules.
These are similar to libraries in other (computer) languages.
Now, I will show a simple program with the use method to include a module in Perl code.
Open a new file in your text editor and name it as sum dot pm.
In the sum dot pm file, type the following code as displayed on the screen.
Here, I have a simple function which will calculate the sum of a given set of numbers.
We will write another Perl script where we’ll use this sum dot pm file.
Let me open the sample program app dot pl file which I have saved already.
In the app dot pl file, type the following code as displayed on the screen.
The first line shows the use method with the module name.
In our case, the module name is 'sum'.
We are passing 1, 7, 5, 4, 9 as input parameters to the function total() in sum dot pm file.
Again, in the next line, we are passing 1 to 10 as input parameters to the same function.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl app dot pl and press Enter.
Observe the output displayed on the terminal.
Let us see few more options in use method. Switch back to sum dot pm in the text editor.
At the beginning of the source code, add the lines  "use strict" semicolon, "use warnings" semicolon.
"use strict" and "use warnings" are compiler flags that instruct Perl to behave in a stricter way.
These are used to avoid common programming mistakes.
use strict forces the user to declare all the variables used in the program.
If there are errors, use strict will abort the execution.
use warnings will only provide warnings but continue with the execution.
Assume that we forgot to declare the variable $sum as my.
Let us now see how the same program is executed.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl app dot pl.
We can see that the program is aborted without executing the result.
The first set of lines displayed on the terminal are error messages generated by “use strict”.
The last two are the abort messages.
So, this is how the use method options work.
Next, let us see a Perl program where we use the require method.
Let me open the sample program commonfunctions dot pl which I have already saved.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen in your commonfunctions dot pl file. Let us understand the code now.
Here, we can see a collection of commonly used functions.
The first function, square(), returns the square of a number.
The second function, square underscore root(), returns the square root of a given number.
Next function, random underscore number(), generates a random number.
The last function random underscore range(), generates a random number between a lower range and upper range of numbers.
Note that we need the 1 semicolon (1;) at the end of the file.
This is because Perl needs the last expression in the file to return a true value.
Next, we will write a Perl program in which we’ll call these subroutines using "require" method.
Let me open the sample program callprogram dot pl which I have already saved.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen in your file. Let me explain the code now.
require reads the commonfunctions dot pl file, containing Perl code, and compiles it.
This program gives 4 options to the user. The user has to choose one option at a time.
1: (one) is to find the square of a number.
2: Two is for square root of a number.
3: Three is for a random number in the given range. 4: Four is to quit the program.
If option 1 (one) is typed, it will ask the user to enter a number.
The value is stored in $number. The value is passed to the function  square() in commonfunctions dot pl file.
The function returns the square of a number.
The print statement prints the square of a number as output.
If option 2 (two) is typed, the square root of a number is displayed as output.
The execution is followed as explained in the previous function square().
If option 3 (three) is typed, a random number is displayed as output in the given range.
Else, if option is 4 (four), the program exits. If any option other than the ones specified is given, the print statement says “Incorrect option”.
Note that in this program, we have called only three functions out of four from commonfunctions dot pl.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl callprogram dot pl.
I'll execute the program once again with a different option.
Type: perl callprogram dot pl.
Now, enter the option as 3.
Enter a lower range as 50.
Enter a upper range as 99.
We can see the random number is generated in the given range of numbers.
Try other options on your own.
In this tutorial, we learnt to use:
Note: "use" module is recommended over "require" module, because it determines module availability at compile time.
Here is an assignment for you. Write a Perl program reminder.pl where you will write a letter to the participants.
Prompt the user to enter To and From name.
Call the subroutines from Letter dot pm using ‘use’ method.
Write the below functions in Letter dot pm file.
LetterDate() function returns the current date and time.
To() function returns the names of the participants.
From() function returns the sender's name.
Lettermsg() function returns the contents of the letter.
Thanksmsg() function returns "thanks" and "regards".
The output should be displayed as shown here.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Control Statements in Ruby.
In this tutorial, we will learn to use:
'if' statement ,  'elsif' statement
'else, 'case' statements.
Ruby 1.9.3.
You must also have knowledge of Linux commands,  Terminal and  Text-editor.
Before we begin, recall that we had created “ttt” directory earlier.
Then to ruby hyphen tutorial control hyphen statements.
Now that we are in that folder, let’s move ahead.
The syntax of the 'if' statement in Ruby is as follows:
if “condition”
ruby code. end
Let us look at an example.
Name it if hyphen statement dot rb.
I have a working example of the  if statement.
I have declared an if statement in this example.
First, I declare a local variable  my_num and assign the value 2345 to it.
Then I declare an if statement.
The puts method declared within the if statement will display the output.
The if statement will check if the value of  my_num is greater than 0.
If it is, it will print out the specified  string.
Now, let us switch to the terminal and type:
ruby space if hyphen statement dot rb.
The output will display  “The value of my_num is greater than 0”.
This output proves that the if condition returned true.
You should now be able to write your own  'if' statement in Ruby.
Let's look at the  'if-else' statement next.
The syntax for using else is:
if “condition” ,  ruby code
else,  ruby code
end
Let us look at an example.
Create a new file in  gedit as shown in the basic level  Ruby tutorials.
Name it if hyphen else hyphen statement dot rb.
I have a working example of the  'if-else' statement.
I have declared an if-else statement in this example.
First I declare a local variable  my_num and assign the value of -1 to it.
Then I declare an if statement.
The 'if' statement will check if the value of 'my_num' is greater than 0.
If it is, it will print out the specified string.
If not, it will go to the else statement.
And it will print out the  string that is specified there.
Now, let us switch to the terminal and type:
ruby space if hyphen else hyphen statement dot rb
and see the output.The output will display  “The value of my_num is lesser than 0”.
This shows that the  else statement was executed.
You should now be able to write your own  if-else statement in Ruby.
Let's look at the  if-elsif statement next.
The syntax for using  elsif is:
if “condition”   ruby code
elsif “condition”   ruby code
else  ruby code
end . Let us look at an example.
Name it  if hyphen elsif hyphen statement dot rb.
I have a working example of the if-elsif statement.
I have declared an if-elsif statement in this example.
Here also, I have declared a local variable my_num and assigned the value -1 to it.
Then I declare an  if statement.
The  if statement  will check if the value of my_num is greater than 0.
If it is, it will print out the specified string.
If this is not  true, it will go into the elsif section.
It will now check if the value of  my_num is equal to -1.
If it is true, it will print out the string that is specified there.
If the value of my_num is neither greater than 0 nor equal to -1, it will go into the else section.
But, since the value of my_num = -1 it will not proceed to the else block.
And, it will exit the  conditional statement.
Now, let us switch to the  terminal and type:
ruby space if hyphen elsif hyphen statement dot rb
and see the output.
The output will display  “The value of my_num is -1 and is lesser than 0”.
Let's go back to our file and change the value of my_num to 5.
Let's save the code and execute it on the terminal.
So, now it fulfills the if condition and the specified string is printed.
"The value of  my_num is greater than 0".
Let's go back to our file and change the value of   my_num to -5.
Let's save the code and execute it on the terminal.
In this case, it fulfills the  else condition and the puts statement within the else block gets executed.
You should now be able to write your own  if-elsif statement in  Ruby.
Let us look at the 'case' statement next.
The 'case' statement is a  control flow statement based on a particular selection.
Let us look at the syntax of the 'case' statement in order to understand this statement.
The syntax for using case is:
case variable
when “value 1”
ruby code .  when “value 2”  ruby code
else  ruby code . end.
Let us look at an example.
Name it case hyphen statement dot rb.
I have a working example of the  'case' statement.
I have declared a case statement in this example.
Here, I have a print statement which will print a question on the terminal.
Then I call a gets which will accept a single line of data from the standard input.
Then I strip the input data of any new line characters using chomp.
I assign the result to a variable named domain.
Then I declare a case statement.
Within that, I declare a when statement .
This checks whether the specified string matches the value of  domain.
First, it checks whether the value of domain is “UP”.
If it is so, it will print out  “Uttar Pradesh”  and exit the case statement.
If domain is not  “UP”, it checks whether the value of  domain is  “MP”.
If it is so, it will print out  “Madhya Pradesh”  and so on.
It will continue checking the value of  domain if no match was found so far.
At this point, it will encounter the  else  statement
as none of the above conditions were true.
It will subsequently execute the  ruby code that follows the else declaration.
It will print  “Unknown” as per our example.
Now, save the file. Switch to the  terminal and type:
ruby space case hyphen statement dot rb.
“Enter the state you live in:” will be displayed on the terminal.
Type in  “UP” and see the output.
The output will display  “Uttar Pradesh”.
Next, execute the  Ruby file again, like before.
This time, at the prompt, type:  “KL” and see the output.
It will print  “Kerala”.
Next, execute the file one more time.
This time, at the prompt, type in  “TN” and see the output.
It will print  “Unknown”.
This is because none of the  cases were satisfied. So, the default else statement is executed.
You should now be able to write your own  case-statements in Ruby.
Let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to use:
if statement
else construct, if-elsif and
case statements.
As an assignment- write a Ruby program
that prompts a user to enter a number,
then use the appropriate control-statement
to check if the number is a multiple of 2.
If it is, then print: “The number entered is a multiple of 2”.
If not, it should check- if it is a multiple of 3.
If it is, then print: “The number entered is a multiple of 3”.
If not, it should check if it is a multiple of 4.
If it is, then print: “The number entered is a multiple of 4”.
If not, it should print: “The number is not a multiple of 2, 3 or 4”.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Congruency of Triangles in GeoGebra.
In this tutorial we will learn to,  Construct congruent triangles and
Here I am using,  Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Geogebra interface.
For the prerequisite GeoGebra tutorials, please visit our website.
First I will explain about congruency of triangles.
Two triangles are congruent if, they are of the same size and shape.
All the corresponding sides and interior angles are congruent.
We will begin with the Side Side Side rule of congruency.
This is the definition of Side Side Side rule of congruency.
I have already opened the GeoGebra interface on my machine.
For this tutorial, I will disable the axes.
I will increase the font size to 18pt for clarity.
Now let us draw a triangle ABC.
Click on the Polygon tool and a draw a triangle ABC, as explained earlier.
We will construct another triangle exactly same as triangle ABC.
Using the Move tool, I will drag triangle ABC to the left side.
This will create some space, for the new construction.
Click on the Circle with Center and Radius tool, then click on the Graphics view.
A Circle with Center and Radius text box opens.
In the Radius text box, type a and click on the OK button at the bottom.
A circle with centre D and radius a is drawn.
Using the Point tool, mark a point E on the circumference of circle d.
Using the Segment tool join points D and E.
Note that, in the Algebra view, segment DE is same as segment BC.
Select the Circle with Center and Radius tool and click on point E.
In the Radius text box, type b and click on the OK button at the bottom.
A circle with centre E and radius b is drawn.
Click again on point D.
A circle with centre D and radius c is drawn.
Now we have three circles in the Graphics view.
We will mark the intersection points of the circles g and e and circles d and e.
Click on the Intersect tool.
Click on the intersection point of circles g and e as F.
Then click on the intersection point of circles d and e as G.
Using the Segment tool, join the points D, F and F, E.
Here we are using the intersection point of circles g and e to get the required triangle.
If we use the intersection point of circles d and e, we will not get the required triangle.
Join the points D, G and G, E.
Compare the segment lengths in the Algebra view.
Now we will hide the circles to see the triangle DEF.
Right-click on circle d.
In the sub-menu, click on Show Object check-box.
Similarly I will hide the circles e and g.
Now we will compare the sides of the triangles ABC and DEF.
In the Algebra view, under Segment right-click on a.
From the sub-menu that opens, select Object Properties.
The Preferences window opens.
Notice that a is already selected.
While holding the Ctrl key, click on b, c, f,  h and i to select them.
In Show Label drop-down, choose Name & Value option.
Close the Preferences window.
Notice that AB = DF, BC  = DE and AC = EF.
Using the Move tool, let us move the points A, B or C.
Note that all the lengths change accordingly, as we drag.
This proves that, triangles ABC and DEF are congruent.
Now we will learn to construct and prove Angle Side Angle rule of congruency.
This is the definition of Angle Side Angle rule of congruency.
Let us open a new GeoGebra window.
Click on File and select New Window.
I will draw a triangle using the Polygon tool.
Next we will measure two angles of the triangle.
Click on the Angle tool and click on the points C B A and A C B.
The values of the angles alpha and beta are displayed in the Algebra view.
Using the Move tool, I will drag the triangle ABC to the left side.
This will create some space to construct the congruent triangle.
Click on Segment with Given Length tool and click in the Graphics view.
Segment with Given Length text box opens.
Type Length as a and click on the OK button at the bottom.
Segment DE is drawn.
Note that the length of segment DE is the same as segment BC.
Now we will construct angles which are same as alpha and beta for the congruent triangle.
Click on the Angle with Given Size tool, click on point E and then on point D.
Angle with Given Size text box opens.
In the text box delete 45 degrees.
Select alpha from the symbols table.
Notice that angle gamma equal to alpha is constructed at D.
Next click on point D and then on point E.
In the Angle with Given Size text box delete 45 degrees.
Select beta  from the symbols table.
This time choose clockwise radio button and click on OK button.
Notice that angle delta equal to beta is constructed at E.
Observe that, points E' and D' are drawn when angles gamma and delta are constructed.
Using the Line tool, we will join the points D, E prime and E, D prime.
After using a particular tool, click on the Move tool to deactivate it.
This will prevent the drawing of unnecessary points in the Graphics view.
The lines g and h intersect at a point.
Using the Intersect tool, mark the point of intersection as F.
We will hide the lines g and h, as we need only the intersection point of the lines.
Right-click on line g and click on Show Object check-box.
Similarly hide the line h.
Using the Segment tool join D, F and F, E.
The formed triangle DEF is congruent to triangle ABC.
In the Algebra view, compare the values of lengths and angles of the triangles.
The values indicate that the angles and side are congruent.
This proves the Angle Side Angle rule of congruency.
Now let us delete all the objects.
Then press Delete key on the keyboard.
Now we learn to construct and prove Side Angle Side rule of congruency.
Here is the definition of Side Angle Side rule of congruency.
Using the Polygon tool, draw a triangle ABC.
Let us measure the angle A C B.
Let us draw the base of the congruent triangle.
Click on Segment with Given Length tool and click in the Graphics view.
In the Segment with Given Length text box, type length as a.
Segment DE is drawn.
Let us copy angle alpha(ACB) at point E.
Click on the Angle with Given Size tool.
Click on point D and then on point E.
Angle with Given Size text box opens.
In the Angle text box, delete 45 degrees and select alpha from the symbols table.
Choose clockwise radio button and click on the OK button.
Angle beta which is same as angle alpha is constructed at point E.
Using the Line tool, let us join points E, D' prime.
Now we need to construct two segments with lengths same as b and c.
Click on the Segment with Given Length tool, and then click on point D.
Segment with Given Length text box opens.
In the Length text box type c and click on the OK button.
Segment DF with length same as AB is drawn in the horizontal direction.
Now click on the Circle with Centre through Point tool.
Click on point D and then click on point F.
A circle with centre at D and passing through F, is drawn.
Observe that circle d intersects line g at two points.
Click on the Intersect tool and click on the points of intersection.
Now we will hide circle d, line g, points D prime and F and segment h, to complete our drawing.
To hide, click on the blue dots corresponding to the objects in the Algebra view.
Using the Segment tool , click on points D G, G, E and D, H to join them.
Here we see the two triangles DGE and DHE.
Notice from the Algebra view that triangle DGE is matching triangle ABC.
Now we will compare the lengths of the sides.
Click on the Distance or Length tool.
Observe that AB = DG,
This indicates that all sides are congruent
The triangles ABC and DGE are congruent using SAS rule of congruency.
Let us summarise what we have learnt.
In this tutorial we have learnt to,

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of GIMP.
Before I start editing this image, I want to tell you in brief about using RAW for your real photography.
If I had shot this image in JPEG, I would have had 256 steps of brightness for encoding it.
You can see it’s nearly black and white, a bit bluish greenish tint and basically it’s only gray.
And with JPEG, you have 256 different values of gray -
zero for black and 255 for white.
And in this image there is no white and only a bit black.
So only a small space of this room is used.
I’ll show you how much later.
I had shot this image in RAW and my camera stores RAW images in 12 bit data format.
This is the image I have got out of the RAW converter after spreading the values and here I have 256 different values of gray and now I can start to edit the image.
In this image, there are more details saved as compared to the first one.
This is the first image I remember and this one I have got after conversion.
The second image is a good base for doing post processing which results in a picture which has the mood of the 1st image but looks better.
Now I have opened the two images in the GIMP. So let’s  have a look at the histogram of the 2 images.
The histogram is hidden in the image dialog.
But we have 3 different ways of reaching the image dialog, first way is on the tool bar.
Second way is to click on Access  the image menu here and  click on dialogs.
And the third way is simply right click into the image, then Dialog and Histogram.
Here’s the histogram of the first image.
Make it a bit bigger and here you see the distribution of different pixels of the different colors in the image.
Digital image is similar to painting by numbers.
When you zoom into the image, you see a lot of little tiles and each of these tiles has a different color which is called as a 'pixel'.
And each color is defined by a value and I can show you these values here with the help of Color Picker.
When I use colour picker, I get the values for red, green & blue.
In this image, the value of red is a bit less than green and blue.
Green and blue have nearly and exactly the same value.
Painting by numbers is digital photography.
In this image here, I have numbers from 0 to 255 and we have a really dark part here but I don’t think it will make into the final image.
I think, the real part of the image starts here  around 80 and the brightest part of the image is here at around 200.
So, we have room from 0 to 256, but we only use 120  which is less than half of data which we could use.
And because of that, a lot of information of the image is lost here.
Let’s have a look at the histogram of the second image.
As we can see here, there is more data in this histogram as compared to first one but the form of the curve is identical.
You compare these two histograms.
Details in the 2nd image is spread out. So the problem I have to solve here is to make the 2nd image compressed like the 1st one.
But it should have a bit more of  details and it should have a bit more of contrast like this one in the first image.
Before I start working with this image, I want to show you a thing that I found out about the GIMP user interface while recording the last tutorial.
When you press tab into the image window, the tool-box here vanishes and helps me in getting the image as big as possible and I can switch the tool-box 'On' and 'Off' as per my requirement.
So I can see it better what I am doing here and you can also see it better.
Before I start editing the image, I have to change some settings.
So, I go to File, Preference and here I go to Window Management and choose the option here,
Keep above for the toolbox and Keep above for the docks and leave the rest of options as it is.
After I press OK, the GIMP works as advertised.
I can select the tools from the tool box and get all options of the tool I have  selected.
I can click back into the image and use tab to switch the tool box on and off.
The first thing to do is to check if the image is leveled.
In this image, there are no reliable man made structures here. So I can’t use the grid method to check if the image is straight .
The surface of the water is a very good clue.
But we don’t see the horizon here and the streaks on the water are also a bit misleading.
This, here, is not the horizon but just a curve in the river.
So, I don’t have a real clue where to set a ruler and check the horizon.
I just have to rely on my eye which I don’t think is the worst way to do something in photography.
Now, I select the Rotate tool and I choose Normal Forward instead of Corrective Backward and I set in Preview as Image and not the Grid.
Ok, click into the image.
Here, in the center, there is a point called "center of rotation" and around that point the image will be rotated.
And here is the dialog where we can set the Angle about which we want to rotate the image.
Here I have a slider which can help me in rotating the image but you can see it is difficult to handle and I don’t think I have to tilt the image this much.
So let’s go back to zero here and now I just use the style here to rotate the image.
I think the image is bit tilted towards the right. So I have to rotate the image to the left i.e. counter-clockwise, so I have to get here negative values.
So, I keep on changing the Angle till I get the correct and straight image.
So, I set the angle for "-0.25°".
Pull this window in and click on rotate and wait for the result of this operation.
Next step: "cropping".
In the image, I want to have the ship, the water and these birds here.
And I don’t want to have in the image is this grass here, this part here and I m really not sure if I want to have this bank of the river in my image.
And I think I will crop this part of image because later I want to have the darkest part of the image.
i.e the birds here, the ship and then the trees, the bank behind the ship, and lastly the water and sky.
And this part of the image is too dark.
I want to zoom into this part of the image as I want to include as much as possible the part of the river but nothing of the bank.
So, I zoom into the part of the image here by pressing the hot key Z.
Here’s another bird flying.
So, I go to the left side and I pull over the ruler close to the bank and leave it here.
And press Shift + ctrl + E which brings me back to the image.
Now I have to select the Crop tool and set some options in it.
I want the Fixed aspect ratio 2:1.
And in Preview, I set Rule of thirds for little bit of help which will provide me some helpful lines.
Let me see, what all is included here.
Here, it is a group of birds and single bird appears here.
Now you can click the rulers away.
On the lower part of image, there is water but I think it’s not enough water in it and too much sky is included.
I can lose this single bird up here because I want this group of birds to stay in the image.
Now I simply pull this down and I think this looks quite nice.
To check my work, I select Rule of thirds.
My eye isn’t so bad because I divided the image into 3 different parts i.e the water, the trees and the sky.
The ship is one of the point of interest.
This group of birds is second point of interest and this one is nice 1/9th of the image.
I think this will work; so I click into the image to crop.
Press tab and shift + ctrl +E to enlarge the image.
I think we have started very well with the cropping of the image and what else to do with this image, I will show you in the next tutorial.
Before I say good bye, I should save the image which I should have done much earlier.
I save the image as Fog.xcf and ‘xcf’ is the extension of GIMP’s own file format and it contains lot of helpful information of layers and undo information and much more from the GIMP.
I would like to hear from you.
Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better by mailing me on to info@meetthegimp.org.

Hello Friends. Welcome to the tutorial on "Getting started with files".
At the end of this tutorial, you will learn to Open a file.
Read the contents of the file line by line.
Read the entire content of the file at once.
Append the lines of a file to a list and Close the file.
To practice this tutorial, you should know about
To open a file for reading or writing, we can use a built in function called open().
Open() function returns a file object.
Mode- This indicates how the file is going to be opened.
r is for Read mode
w is for Write mode
a represents Appending mode and r+  for both Read and Write mode
Let us open a file pendulum.txt in a text editor.
This file contains 2 data columns, length and time of pendulum.
The file pendulum.txt is available in the Code File link of this tutorial.
Let us clear the terminal.
Let us open the file pendulum.txt.
Type f is equal to open inside parentheses inside quotes pendulum dot txt
Here the mode is not specified. By default, it is ‘r’.
Let us type f on the terminal to see what it is.
The file object f shows the filename and mode of the file which is open.
'r' stands for read only mode.
Now let us learn to read the whole file into a single variable.
Type pend equal to f dot read open and close parentheses.
We use the read method to read all the contents of the file into the variable pend
To use read method we use the file object dot read method.
Now, let us see what pend contains, by typing print inside parentheses pend.
We can see that pend has all the data of the file pendulum.txt.
Type just pend to see more explicitly, what it contains.
We can see the newline characters as well, in the output.
Let us learn to split the variable pend into a list of lines in the file.
We use the method splitlines to split a file of data into list of lines.
For this we need to store this list in a variable, say pend_list
Type pend_list equal to pend dot splitlines open and close parentheses
Type pend underscore list
We got the data into list of lines.
pend_list does not contain newline characters like \n.
This is because the string pend is split on the newline characters.
Let us close the file opened into f.
Type f  dot close  open and close parentheses
It is a good programming practice  to close any file objects that we have opened
Pause the video here, try out the following exercise and then resume the video.
Re-open the file pendulum.txt with f as the file object.
Recall that we have closed the file earlier.
Let us now move on to reading files line by line.
To re-open the file again, type
Now, to read the file line-by-line, we iterate over the file object using the for loop.
Let us iterate over the file line-wise and print each of the lines.
Type for line in f colon press Enter
Here, line is a loop variable, and it is not a keyword.
We could have used any other variable name, but line seems meaningful enough.
Instead of just printing the lines, let us append them into a list, say line_list.
We first initialize a line_list as an empty-list
Type, line underscore list is equal to open and close square brackets.
Type the code as
four space line underscore list dot append inside parentheses line
Here, the for loop reads the file pendulum.txt line-by-line.
The append method will add each of the line to the list, line_list.
We could, as usual close the file using f.close() and re-open it.
But, this time, let's leave the file object f and directly open the file within the for statement.
This will save us the trouble of closing the file, each time we open it.
Let us see what line_list contains.
line underscore  list is a list of the lines in the file, along with the newline characters.
We can strip out the newline characters from the lines by using some string methods.
This will be covered in the further tutorial on strings.
Read the data in the files as a whole, by using the read method.
Read the data in the files line by line by iterating over the file object using the for loop.
Append the lines of a file to a list using the append method within the for loop.
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
1. The open function returns a
2. What does the function splitlines() do.
Displays the data as strings all in a line
Displays the data line by line as strings
Displays the data line by line but not as strings
And the answers are,
splitlines() displays the data line by line as strings
Thats it for the tutorial. This is Trupti Kini from IIT Bombay (or FOSSEE, if you wish) signing off.
Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer- Printing and Viewing documents.
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:
Viewing Documents.
Printing Documents.Here we are using GNU/Linux  as our operating system and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
So, let us start our tutorial by learning about the various viewing options in LibreOffice Writer.
There are basically two widely used viewing options in Writer.
They are Print Layout and Web Layout.
The Print Layout option displays how the document will look when printed.
The Web Layout option displays the document as seen in a web browser.
This is useful when you want to create HTML documents as well as when you want to view the document in full-screen mode for editing them.
To access the Print Layout option, click on the View option and then click on the Print Layout option.
In order to access the Web Layout option, click on the View option in the menu bar and then click on the Web Layout option.
Apart from both these options, one can also view the document in full-screen mode.
Click on the View option in the menu bar and then click on the Full Screen option.
The full-screen mode is useful for editing the documents as well as for projecting them on a projector.
In order to exit the full screen mode, press the Escape  key on the keyboard.
We see that the document exits the full-screen mode.
Now let us click on the Print Layout option in View menu.
Before proceeding further, let us add a new page to our document by clicking Insert >> Manual Break  and choosing the Page break option.
We will learn about this in more details, in another tutorial.
Another option for viewing the document is called Zoom.
Click on the View option in the menu bar and then  click on Zoom.
You see that a  Zoom and View Layout dialog-box appears in front of us.
It has headings namely- Zoom factor and View layout.
The Zoom factor sets the zoom factor to display the current document and all documents of the same type that you open thereafter.
It has useful options which we will discuss one by one.
On clicking the Optimal option, you get the most favorable view of the document.
The Fit width and height view fits the document across the entire width and height of the page.  Thereby it displays one page at a time.
It makes the viewing and editing of multiple pages of a document much easier.
Next option is Fit Width.  This fits the page to its width.
100% view will display the page in its actual size.
Next, we have the most important viewing option called the Variable.
In the variable field, you can enter the zoom factor at which you want to display the document.
For example, we enter the value as 75% in the Variable  field and then click on the OK button.
Likewise, you can change the zoom factor according to your need and convenience for viewing and editing the documents.
Another feature in the dialog-box is the View layout.
The View layout option is for text documents.
It is used to reduce the zoom factor to see the effects of different view layout settings in the document.
It has options like Automatic and  Single page for displaying pages side by side and beneath each other respectively.
For example: if we select the Fit width and height option under Zoom factor, then click on the Single page option under the View layout option and finally click on the OK button, we see that the pages are displayed one below the other.
Now, click on the Automatic option and then click on the OK button.
You see that the pages are displayed in side-by-side manner.
The three controls on the Writer Status Bar also allow to change the zoom and view layout of our document.
The View Layout icons from left to right are as follows: Single column mode, view mode with pages side by side and book mode with two pages as in an open book.
We can also drag the Zoom slider to the right to zoom into a page or to the left to show more pages.
Before learning about printing in LibreOffice Writer, let us learn something about Page preview.
Click on File and click on Page Preview.
The Page Preview bar appears when you view the current document in the page preview mode.
It basically shows how your document will look like, when it is printed.
You can see the preview of our 'resume.odt' file.
There are various control options in the tool bar of the preview page.
There are options to  Zoom In, Zoom Out, Next page, Previous page and Print.
After learning how to view documents in LibreOffice Writer as well as Page Preview, we will now learn how a Printer functions in LibreOffice Writer.
A printer, in simple words, is an output device used to print a document.
We will now see how to access the various options of Print.
Click on the Tools in the menu bar  and then click on Options.
Click on the arrow beside LibreOffice Writer and finally click on  Print.
A dialog-box appears on the screen, giving you options to select from.
So, we keep the default settings and then click on the OK button.
Now, to directly print the entire document, click on the Print File Directly icon in the tool bar.
This is known as Quick Printing.
You can have more control over printing any document by accessing the Print option and changing the default settings.
Click on the File menu in the menu bar and then click on Print.
The Print dialog-box appears on the screen.
Here, we select the Generic Printer option in General Tab.
The All pages option is for printing all the pages of the document.
If you want to print a range of pages you can select the Pages option and enter the range in the field. For e.g.- we will type 1-3 here. This will print the first three pages of the document.
If you want to print multiple copies of the document then enter the value in  the Number  of copies field. Let us enter the value 2 in the field.
Now, let us click on the Options tab in the dialog-box.
A list of options appears on the screen from where you can select and print in the document.
We see a check-box namely Print in reverse page order.
This option makes it easier to collect large outputs.
So, click on the check-box against it.
You can also take a print-out of your pdf document.
We have already seen how to convert a dot odt document to a dot pdf file.
Since we have already saved the 'pdf' file on the desktop, we will double-click on the pdf file.
Now, click on the File option and then click on Print.
Let us keep the default settings and then click on the Print Preview  button.
You see that the preview of the file on the screen.
Now click on the Print this document icon, in the preview page, in order to print it.
Viewing documents.
Printing documents.
COMPREHENSIVE ASSIGNMENT-
Write the text "This is LibreOffice Writer" in Writer.
Use the Full Screenoption to get a full screen view of the document.
Use the zoom option to have an optimal as well as Variable view of the document. Set the variable value as 50% and then view the document.
Have a Page preview of the document and print two copies of the document with borders on the page.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Categories in Joomla.
Learner of this tutorial should know how to create an article in Joomla.
If not, please refer to the relevant Joomla tutorials on the Spoken Tutorial website.
Let’s switch to the Joomla control panel.
Click on Article Manager in the left menu.
We currently have 2 articles - Vitamin A and Benefits of Sodium.
In order to understand categories in Joomla, let’s create a few more articles.
Open the assignment-text file provided with this tutorial.
Follow the instructions to create 4 new articles- Vitamin B:, Benefits of Nutrients:, Fish: and Green Vegetables:.
We now have 6 articles in Article Manager- Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Benefits of Sodium, Benefits of Nutrients , Fish and Green Vegetables.
The 2 articles on Vitamins are similar in content.
So, we should group them together.
Categories in Joomla help to organize the articles in a logical order.
Click on Categories in the left menu.
Alternately, click on Content Menu at the top and then on Category Manager.
Notice that the Category Manager has a similar layout as that of the Article Manager.
It has a Search box and Search Tools button to filter the Categories.
By default, we have one category called Uncategorized.
Recollect that all our articles appeared as  Uncategorized.
To create a new category, click on the New button on the top left.
The only mandatory field to create a category is the Category Title.
I will write Vitamin as the title in the title textbox.
Click on Save and Close
You can see that the new category has now been created.
To edit or rename a category, click on the title of the category.
I will rename the title to Vitamins.
This time let’s click on Save and New button.
We are prompted to add a new category.
Let’s type Minerals as the title.
Then click on Save and Close.
Now, Minerals and Vitamins are nutrients that our bodies need.
Let us put them in a broader category Nutrients.
Click on New and type Nutrients as the title.
Then click on Save and Close.
Let us put Vitamins and Minerals under the category Nutrients.
A category under another category is called subcategory.
Select the two categories by clicking the check-box to the left of the status column.
We can batch process these 2 categories.
Batch processing means working on things in groups.
Click on Batch button in the toolbar at the top.
A new window with the title Batch Process the Selected Categories opens.
It has many options.
For now, we are only going to change the parent category of these categories.
So, select Nutrients in the Select Category for Move/ Copy drop-down.
There are 2 radio buttons below the drop-down, namely: Copy,  Move.
Copy will make a copy of the selected categories, in the selected category.
Move will move the category from their previous category, to the selected category.
Let's select Move and then click on Process.
Notice a hyphen in front of Vitamins and Minerals categories.
This indicates that they are subcategories of the main category Nutrients.
Pause the tutorial here and do this assignment.
Create a new category Carbohydrates, click on Parent drop-down on the right and select Nutrients. Click on Save and Close.
Notice that this is another way to assign categories and subcategories to a parent category.
Now, we have a Category tree.
There are 2 main categories: Uncategorized and Nutrients.
Under Nutrients, we have 3 sub-categories: Vitamins, Minerals and Carbohydrates.
Now, let us learn how to organize various articles under different categories.
From Category Manager, click on Articles in the left menu.
Select the two vitamin articles by clicking the check-box to the left of the Status column.
Click on Batch button in the toolbar on top.
A new window with the title Batch Process the Selected Articles opens.
Select Vitamins in Select Category for Move/ Copy drop-down.
Let's select Move and then click on Process button.
Notice that the category for our articles Vitamin A and Vitamin B has changed.
Let us change the category of Benefits of Sodium to Minerals.
Click on the title Benefits of Sodium.
In the Category drop-down on the right, select Minerals. Then click on Save and Close.
Note that the category of Benefits of Sodium has been changed to Minerals.
Pause the tutorial here and do this assignment.
Now it’s time to check all these changes on the Digital India webpage.
Before that, ensure that Show Category is set to Show for the articles.
Click on Options button in the toolbar at the top right corner.
Set Show Category to Show and Link Category to Yes.
Click on Save and Close.
Now, click on the Digital India link at the top right.
Notice that the articles have different Category names in their header.
Click on the Category Nutrients in the article header of Benefits of Nutrients.
Observe that it lists one article and 2 subcategories – Vitamins and Minerals.
This is how we had organized the categories.
Note that the category Carbohydrates is not visible here.
A category having neither articles nor subcategories is an empty Category. And hence it is not visible on the web-page.
Can we relax this restriction?
Let us see how to change the settings to get the empty categories displayed.
Switch to the Article Manager web-page.
Click on the Categories in the left menu to go to the Category Manager.
Click on Options button in the toolbar on right.
Note that the Category Manager Options page is the same as Article Manager Options.
Even the title says Article Manager Options.
There are tabs in this page to control the settings of articles, categories, menus etc.
Click on the tab Category.
The tab will show the settings of the page which shows all articles under a particular category.
Scroll down to see the option Empty Categories.
Set this as Show.
Click on Save and Close
Switch to the ‘Digital India’ web-page and refresh it.
Look, the Carbohydrates subcategory is now visible.
Go back to the Category Manager web-page.
The subcategory Carbohydrates does not have any articles under it.
We can either: Unpublish it or delete it.
Let’s understand the difference between the two options.
When we unpublish a category, no new article can be assigned to that category.
All its subcategories are automatically unpublished and articles under the category are no longer visible on the website, even if they are published.
When we delete a category, it is moved to Trash, along with all the articles under it.
A deleted category can be restored again or the same could be trashed permanently.
Come back to the Category Manager web-page.
Since we are not using the category Carbohydrates, let's unpublish it for now.
Locate the category Carbohydrates from the Categories Manager page.
Now, select it by clicking the check-box to the left of the Status column.
Click on the Unpublish button in the toolbar on top.
Immediately, a success message appears.
Observe that the status of the category Carbohydrates has changed to Unpublished.
Let us go back to the Digital India webpage and verify this.
Switch to the Digital India webpage and refresh it.
Notice that the category Carbohydrates is no longer visible.
This is because it has been unpublished.
Here is an assignment for you: create a new category Food Sources.
Create 2 subcategories, Veg Sources and Non-veg Sources, under the category Food Sources.
Assign the article Fish to Non-Veg sources.
Assign the article Green Vegetables to Veg Sources.
Refresh the Homepage.
Observe the changes and understand what has happened.
Delete the category Veg Sources.
Try to restore it back.
Hint is, to use the filter to see Trashed categories.
Edit the category Vitamins to add a description.
Change the settings to show the description and number of articles in a category.
Refresh the Homepage. Observe the changes and understand what has happened.

Hello friends! Welcome to the spoken tutorial on "Multiple plots".
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
use the figure command,
use the legend command,
switch between the plots and perform some operations on each of them like saving the plots.
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to:
embellish a plot,
Let us create a set of points for our plot by using the command 'linspace'.
Type x equals to linspace inside the brackets 0 comma 50 comma 10.
Now, let us draw a simple sine curve using these points.
As we can see, this sine curve is not a smooth curve. What really caused this?
This happened because we selected few points that is 10, for this large interval of 0 to 50.
'Plot' function does not plot the analytical function.
It plots the points given by the analytical function.
Now, let us use linspace command to get 500 points between 0 and 50 and draw the sine curve again.
Type y equals to linspace inside the brackets 0 comma 50 comma 500.
plot inside the brackets y comma sin(y).
Now we see a sine curve with a smooth curve.
Notice, we will also have two plots one overlaid upon another.
In pylab, by default, all the plots are overlaid.
To distinguish between two overlaid plots we use the 'legend' command.
Type legend inside the brackets square brackets sin(x) comma sin(y).
The legend command takes parameter as a list of strings.
Then it assigns strings to plots in the order they were created.
Now, we can see the legends being displayed for the two sine curves on the plot area.
In the IPython terminal, now type clf() to clear the plot window.
Draw two plots, first plot being a parabola of the form y equals to 4x square,
and the second being a straight line of the form y equals to 2x plus 3 in the interval minus 5 to 5.
Use legends to indicate what each plot is doing.
Switch to the terminal for solution.
We can obtain the two plots in different colours using the following commands.
plot inside the brackets x comma 4 multiplied by inside the brackets x multiplied by x.
plot inside the brackets x comma 2 multiplied by x plus 3.
Now, we will add a legend to identify the plots.
Type: legend inside the brackets inside square brackets r inside inverted commas dollar y is equal to 4 x square dollar comma r inside inverted commas dollar y equals to 2x plus 3 dollar.
We can see the legend added to the plot.
Next we will learn to switch between the plots and perform operations such as saving the plots etc.
Let us see how to accomplish this. But, before we move on, let us clear our screen.
Type: x equals to linspace inside the brackets 0 comma 50 comma 500.
To accomplish more control over individual plots, we use the 'figure' command.
plot inside the brackets x comma sin(x) comma inside inverted commas b.
figure(2)
plot inside the brackets x comma cos(x) comma inside inverted commas g.
Now, we have two plots, a sine curve and a cosine curve, in two different figures.
The figure command takes an integer as an argument.
All the plot commands we run hereafter are applied to the selected plot.
For example, we can save each plot separately.
Type: title inside brackets inside inverted commas cos(x).
savefig inside the brackets inside inverted commas cosine.png
figure(1)
title inside the brackets inside inverted commas sin(x).
savefig inside the brackets inside inverted commas sine.png
The figures will be saved in current working directory.
Draw a line of the form y equals to x as one figure and another line of the form y is equal to 2x plus 3.
Switch to the terminal for solution.
Type: figure(1)
plot inside the brackets x comma x.
Now, use the figure command to create second plotting area and plot the figure.
Type: figure(2)
We will save the figure as follows.
Type: figure(1)
figure(2)
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:
use the figure command,
use the legend command,
switch between the plots and perform some operations on each of them like saving the plots.
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve-
What will be the command to identify sine and cosine curve?
And the answers are-
The legend command-  legend inside the brackets inside square brackets inside inverted commas sin(x) comma inside inverted commas cos(x).

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Viewing and Printing text documents.
In this tutorial we will learn how to
LibreOffice Suite version 6.3.5
Viewing options
There are basically two widely used viewing options in Writer.
They are Normal and Web.
The Normal option displays how the document will look when printed.
The Web option displays the document as seen in a web browser.
This is useful when we want to create HTML documents.
It’s also useful when we want to view the document in full screen mode for editing them.
Open the file “Resume.odt” which we have created earlier.
The file has been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Please download and extract the file.
Make a copy and then use it for practising.
To access the Normal option, click on View menu in the menu bar.
To access the Web option, click on the View menu in the menu bar.
Apart from both these options, one can also view the documents in full screen mode.
Click on the View menu in the menu bar and then on Full Screen option.
The Full screen mode is useful for editing the documents.
It’s also useful for projecting them on a projector.
Press either the Full Screen button.
We are back to the Writer window.
Now, let’s click on the View menu once again and then on the Normal option.
Before proceeding further, let us add a new page to our document.
Click the Insert menu in the menu bar, then on the Page break option.
We are moved to a new page in the document.
Press Ctrl+Z keys to undo this change.
Let me demonstrate another way to add a new page.
Click on the Insert menu in the menu bar then on the More Breaks option.
The Insert Break dialog box opens up.
Here, select the Page break option.
Then click on the OK button in the dialog box.
Let’s now type some sample text on a few lines in this new page.
We’ll add one more page by pressing Ctrl+Enter keys together.
And type this sample text in the new page.
Press Ctrl+Enter keys once again and create one more new page.
And type this sample text in the new page.
Now, let’s learn to use the Zoom option.
The easiest way to zoom or magnify a document is to use the Zoom slider.
This is located at the bottom right corner of the Writer window.
We can use the plus and minus icons on either side of the slider, like this.
Or we can drag the Zoom head to increase or decrease the magnification, like this.
Let's learn another way of zooming.
Click on the View menu in the menu bar and click on Zoom.
A few options are displayed in the context menu.
We’ll skip these and click on the Zoom option.
Zoom & View Layout dialog box opens up.
It has 2 headings namely - Zoom Factor and View Layout.
The Zoom Factor sets the magnification in which to display the document.
Under Zoom Factor we see many options.
Click on Optimal and then on the Ok button at the bottom right.
On doing so, we get the most comfortable magnified view of the document.
Again open the Zoom & View Layout dialog box.
Click on Fit width and height and then on the Ok button at the bottom right.
This view fits the document across the entire width and height of the page.
Next option is Fit Width. This fits the page to its width.
100% view will display the page in its actual size.
Try out these 2 options on your own.
Next we have the most important zoom option called the Variable.
Here, we can type the zoom factor at which we want to view the document.
For example, let’s type the value as 75% in the Variable field.
Observe how the text is zoomed.
Another feature in the dialog-box is View Layout.
We see 2 options here - Automatic and Single page.
Automatic option displays pages side-by-side.
Single page displays pages one below another.
Let’s try out some combinations now.
For example- we’ll select Fit width and height option under Zoom Factor
Then click on the Automatic option under the View Layout
We see that the pages are displayed side-by-side.
Open the Zoom & View Layout dialog box once again, as shown here.
This time we’ll select Single page under View Layout and click on the OK button.
We see that the pages are displayed one below the other.
Let’s use the zoom slider and bring the Zoom head to the centre of the slider.
There are 3 more controls on the Writer Status Bar that can be used for page displays.
These also allow us to change the zoom and view layout of our document.
The icons are as follows:
Single-page view, Multiple-page view and Book view.
Book view displays two pages adjacent to each other, as in an open book.
Let’s click on Single page view and bring the Zoom head to the centre of the zoom slider.
Next, we will learn about Print Preview.
Click on the Toggle Print Preview icon in the Standard toolbar.
The Print Preview bar appears when we view the document in preview mode.
It basically shows how the document will look like, when it is printed.
Scroll down to see all the pages in the document.
From this screen, one can proceed to printing the document, by clicking the Print icon.
Click on the Close Preview button to close the preview.
We can also click on File menu in the menu bar and click on Print Preview.
Next, we will learn how to print our LibreOffice Writer document.
Please, ensure that the printer connection is configured correctly on your machine.
To directly print the entire document, click on the Print icon in the Standard toolbar.
We can have more control over printing our document by using the Print option.
Click on the File menu in the menu bar and then click on Print.
The Print dialog box appears on the screen.
There are 2 tabs with different settings in this dialog box.
We can either leave these as default or change the setting as per our printing requirement.
Under Printer drop-down, let’s select Print to File option.
This option is used predominantly to print the document into PDF file format.
The button at the bottom of the dialog box says Print to File.
Choose the location to save and type a filename for the new document.
The document will be printed to the file
Press Ctrl+P keys on your keyboard.
This time under Printer, we will select our configured printer’s name.
Under Range and Copies,
Finally, click on the OK button to start the printing.
The pages and copies we mentioned will now get printed.
Next, we will see how to access other Print options.
Click on the Tools menu in the menu bar and then click on Options.
Click on the arrow beside LibreOffice and then click on Print.
A dialog box appears on the screen, giving us several options to select from.
Choose these options as per requirements.
These settings are now valid for all prints from LibreOffice Writer, in the future.
I will keep all the default settings and then click on the OK button at the bottom.
Save our file by pressing Ctrl + S keys.
Then close it by clicking on the X icon at the top right.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:

The video at the following summarises the Spoken Tutorial project
We conduct workshops using spoken tutorials and give certificates.
Post your timed queries in this forum.
The Spoken Tutorial project is funded by MHRD Govt of India.
This tutorial was originally contributed by DesiCrew Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in 2011
This is Pratik Kamble along with the Spoken Tutorial team from IIT Bombay signing off.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Table with primary keys.
data redundancy,
To follow this tutorial, you should have good understanding of basic computer concepts and
working knowledge of any programming language.
Let us open pgAdmin.
Ensure that you have connected to the localhost server.
Click on the 'students' table  and then click on Columns node.
We can see the students table with 5 columns which we created earlier.
Let us learn how to insert some data into this table.
Right-click on the students table.
The SQL Editor window opens up with the basic syntax for an Insert statement.
Insert statement inserts one or more rows into a table.
The values to be inserted must match the order of the columns and the datatype of each column.
That is - column 1 takes the value 1 and column 2 takes the value 2 and so on.
Type the values as shown.
The order of the column name should match the values.
Note that character data type values are always enclosed in quotes.
Next we will execute the insert statement.
Click on the triangle icon in the toolbar to execute the query.
We can see the message 'Query returned successfully: One row affected'.
This indicates that one row of data is inserted into the students table.
I’ll insert one more record.
Execute the query.
Let us now retrieve the data which we have inserted, from the table.
Click on the “Clear edit window” icon in the toolbar to clear the previous statement.
Then type: Select asterisk from
Here we have to specify the table name. Press Ctrl and spacebar together.
A list of available tables appears as shown.
Here, Select is a query command which is used to retrieve data from the tables.
Asterisk means all the rows from the table.
This statement will fetch all the values from the students table.
Now click on the triangle icon in the toolbar to execute the query.
We can see the output in a tabular form, in the output pane.
Next I will demonstrate how to add multiple student details at the same time.
The syntax to insert multiple rows is shown here.
We can insert multiple rows in a single insert statement.
Here, I have entered the information of the students 'Ram', 'Kishore' and ‘Pooja’.
Let us save the script of this Insert statement for future use.
To do so, click on the Save file icon on the toolbar.
Enter the name of the file as insertscript hyphen student.
Select the folder where you want to save the file. I'll select Desktop.
By default, the file will always be saved with 'dot sql' extension.
As before, click on the triangle icon in the toolbar to execute the query.
In the output pane, we can see the message “3 rows affected”.
Once again we will retrieve the data from the students table.
To do so, click on the Previous queries drop-down box.
Click on “Select asterisk from students” from the list.
Now execute the query.
We can see there are two students with the same name ‘Ram’ but the other column values are different.
How will the institute or organization identify a particular student Ram’s details?
Each student is unique and they need to be identified with some unique attribute.
Therefore in our example student id can be the ‘primary key constraint’.
Primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table.
Follow these rules when you define a primary key for a table.
A table should have only one primary key.
A primary key can be a single column or a set of columns.
The combination of values in these multiple columns must be unique.
For example-
here, there is a duplicate row of data for the student name ‘Kishore’.
By mistake, I have entered the student Kishore’s details twice.
First, I demonstrated to insert a single record 2 times and then I inserted 3 records.
Data redundancy, that is data repetition will affect the performance of the database.
More information on Data redundancy is given in the Additional material link of this tutorial.
How can we prevent insertion of duplicate data?
Now I’ll show how to add a primary key.
Let’s go to the pgAdmin main screen.
Let me copy the script of create table statement and paste in the SQL Editor.
This is the code which we executed to create the students table.
Can we add a student name column as the primary key to identify each student?
No, student name cannot be assigned as a primary key as there may be many students with the same name.
We have to identify a column with unique values.
So, we will add a student id column to this table to identify each student.
Type the code as shown on the screen.
I have added a new column called studentid which will store a unique code for each student.
I have defined studentid as the primary key.
We can see an error saying  "relation 'students' already exists".
This means we tried to create a table with the same name students.
Two objects cannot have the same name in a database.
First we will drop the students table along with the data which we inserted now.
Then we will again create the students table with primary key constraints.
Go to the pgAdmin main screen.
Right-click on the students table.
A pop-up window for Drop table appears.
This removes a table definition and all its associated data.
The syntax to drop a table is DROP TABLE tablename.
We can also type the statement in the SQL Editor and execute the query.
Switch to the SQL Editor window.
Now, let us create the students table with student id as primary key.
Execute the query.
I'll insert the data from the insertscript hyphen student.sql file which we saved earlier.
Click “Open file” icon in the toolbar and select the insertscript hyphen student file.
The file is opened in the SQL editor window.
Next I’ll pass a unique id for each student.
I’ll add another record for student Ram with unique student id as shown.
We can see that four records have been successfully inserted.
What will happen if we try to insert the same set of data into the students table again?
Let us try that. Execute the insert statement one more time.
We can see the error message “duplicate key value violates unique constraint”.
It shows an error which indicates the duplication of data.
Next, let us retrieve the inserted data.
We can see there is no duplication of data.
With this we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
data redundancy,
As an Assignment, drop the Emp table which was created in an earlier assignment in this series.
Create the Emp table with empno as primary key.
Insert few records into the Emp table.

Welcome back.  In the first part of this tutorial, I showed you how to take out specific properties of our uploaded file using this form here.
Now I'll show you how to upload this file and move it to the "uploaded" folder here which is currently empty.
If you recall, we're referring to a temporary area that is being stored on our web-server.
It's not of much use right now.
We have all our properties here, so I'll say "properties of the uploaded file", so we know what we're doing.
We have all our specific properties here.
I've given all of them easy to remember variable names; so we don't need to comment each of these individually.
First thing we will do is, create an if statement to check if there are any errors.
Here, if error code is bigger than zero meaning it has been issued by an error code then I'll say 'die'.
And I will give an error message out "File couldn't..."
Or "Error uploading file! code $error".
This will give the user an error code.
Now the else part.
I'll add these curly brackets to keep that simple and in a single line.
So else, I want to use a function called 'move_uploaded_file()'.
Then we'll take the temporary name 'temp' which is the first parameter of this function and the second parameter is the destination which is 'uploaded folder'.
So, I'll type 'uploaded' and a forward slash.
And at the end of that we'll concatenate the name of the file that we've uploaded.
So, here it would just be '$name'.
This shows the user just adding the inter variables here.
Otherwise we would have to type these, for example - "temp_name".
Then go here and place it like this.
It gets quite messy and hard to read.
So, it's easier to just keep these variables here.
Okay, so now I'll get rid of these or rather I'll keep these.
And lastly echo out a message saying "Upload complete!".
I logon to our page and pick our file - 'intro to avi'.
I'll click on upload and we can see that "Upload is complete!".
Let's check my file.
Upload folder and click on my "uploaded" sub directory, you can see that the file is here whereas before it had been stored in the temporary directory on my web-server.
So we've successfully uploaded our file here.
There are a few more things that we need to do.
Undo another if statement or undo this if statement.
We are going to check for specific file types that we don't want uploaded.
So for example let's say, I don't want 'avi' files to be uploaded.
What I could do here is, say - if error is bigger than zero, don't upload files.
Otherwise I'll start a new if  statement inside the else.
And I'll create a block here.
And these are the conditions for the file.
I'll say - if the type of file - that's our $type variable, t-y-p-e, 2 equal to signs, equals video slash avi.
As you saw in the first part of this, as I echoed it out, it was equal to video slash avi.
And then we're saying that if it is equal to video slash avi then upload the file.
I'll just move it down here and I will put that into the else block.
So now I have - if the video is equal to avi then die and the message is "That format is not allowed!".
Okay, so now I'll delete this from our uploaded directory and I'll come back to my initial uploaded file.
I'll choose 'intro dot avi' and when I click Upload, it says that "That format is not allowed!".
And if you go to my 'uploaded' directory, you can see that the folder is empty.
Nothing has been uploaded.
Now instead of 'avi' let us say I want to ban 'images with png' extension.
I'll change it here and upload my file again.
You can see that because it's an accepted file format, we get the message "Upload complete!" and it's been transferred to my 'uploaded' folder.
Let's delete that again.  Oh! I canceled it.  Let's delete that again.
Okay. So what we've seen here is how to specify a specific type.
What we also can do is specify a specific file size.
I'll say 'or' using this or operator and I'll say or the $size is bigger than half a megabyte.
This is half a megabyte which is five hundred thousand bits, sorry bytes.  I think I made a mistake and said bits instead of bytes.
So that's five hundred thousand bytes which is equal to 0 point 4 megabytes. I'll just say half a megabyte for now.
This will evaluate the size and say is it bigger than half a megabyte.
Then it will say this "Format is not allowed".
So I'll change this message to accommodate "Format not allowed or file size too big".
So, you can create an if statement for each of these that is for evaluating your $type and evaluating your $size.
You just need to take this condition and put it in another if statement.
So, I go back here and I'll choose my file again.
Just making sure it's there.
Click Upload and it'll say "Format not allowed...".
Now if you go back to our code, this is not in 'png' format but it is exceeding the size limit.
Let's change this to 2 million which is 2 megabytes.
Refresh and send that.
We can see that our upload has been completed because this is only one megabyte in size.
That's all I have on File Upload for now.
This is all you need to know to use this to keep out specific file types and file sizes that are too large for your web-server.
If you don't want big files on your web server, this is a good way to control it.
It's very easy to create as you've seen.
Practice this and you'll be quite impressed with how useful this can be.
If you've got any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
Also please subscribe, if you want to be notified on any updated videos or new videos.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Slide Master and Slide Design in LibreOffice Impress.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply: Backgrounds for slides Layouts for slides.
Background refers to all the colors and effects applied to the slide which are present behind the content.
LibreOffice Impress has many background options that help you create better presentations.
You can even create your own custom backgrounds.
Let’s open the presentation "Sample-Impress.odp".
Let’s create a custom background for our presentation.
We shall also apply this background to all the slides in the presentation.
We shall use the Slide Master option to create this background.
Any change made to the Master slide is applied to all the slides in the presentation.
From the Main menu, click View, select Master and click on Slide Master.
The Master Slide appears.
Notice that the Master View toolbar is also visible. You can use this to create, delete and rename Master Pages.
Notice that the two slides are displayed now.
These are two Master Pages that have been used in this presentation.
From the Tasks pane, click on Master Pages.
The "Used in This Presentation" field displays the Master slides used in this presentation.
The Master slide is like a template.
You can set formatting preferences here which are then applied to all the slides in the presentation.
First, from the Slides pane, let’s select Slide 1.
Let’s apply a white background to this presentation.
From the Main menu, click on Format and click Page.
The Page Setup dialog-box appears.
Click the Background tab.
From the Fill drop-down menu, select the option Bitmap.
From the list of options, select Blank and click OK.
The slide now has a white background.
Notice that the existing text color doesn’t show up very well against the background.
Always choose a color that is visible distinctly against its background.
Let’s change the color of the text to black. This will make the text clearly visible against the white background.
First select the text.
From the Main menu, click Format and select Character.
The Character dialog-box appears.
From the Character dialog-box, click Font Effects tab.
From the Font Color drop-down, select Black.
The text is now black in color.
Now, let’s apply a color to the slide.
Right-click on the slide for the context menu and click Slide and Page Setup.
From the Fill drop down menu, select the option Color. Select Blue 8 and click OK.
Notice that the light blue color we selected is applied to the slide.
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment. Create a new Master Slide and apply the color red as the background.
Let’s now learn how to add another design element to this presentation.
For example, you can add a logo to your presentation.
Look at the Basic Shapes toolbar in the bottom of your screen.
You can use it to draw a variety of basic shapes such as circles, squares, rectangles, triangles and ovals.
Let’s draw a rectangle in the Title area of the slide.
From the Basic Shapes toolbar, click on Rectangle.
Now, move the cursor to the top left corner of the slide, in the Title area.
You will see a plus sign with a capital 'I'.
Hold the left-mouse-button and drag to draw a small rectangle.
Now, release the mouse button.
You have drawn a rectangle!
Notice the eight handles on the rectangle.
Handles or control points are the small blue squares that appear on the sides of the selected object.
We can use these control-points to adjust the size of the rectangle.
As you hover your cursor over the control point, the cursor changes to a double-sided arrow.
This indicates the directions in which the control point can be moved to manipulate the basic shape.
Let’s enlarge this rectangle so that it covers the title area completely. <Pause>
We can format these shapes too!
Right-click on the rectangle to view the context menu.
Here, you can choose various options to modify the rectangle.
Click on Area. The Area dialog-box appears.
In the Fill field, from the drop-down menu, choose Color.
Choose Magenta 4 and click OK.
The color of the rectangle has changed.
The rectangle has now covered the text.
To make the text visible, first select the rectangle.
Now right-click to open the context menu.
Click on Arrange and then Send to back.
The text is visible again!
Here the rectangle has moved behind the text.
In the Tasks pane, click on the preview of the Master Page.
Right-click and select Apply to All Slides.
Close the Master View by clicking on the Close Master View button.
The formatting changes made in the Master are applied to all the slides in the presentation now.
Notice that the rectangle is also displayed in all the pages.
Let us learn to change the layout of the slide.
What are Layouts? Layouts are slide templates that are pre-formatted for position of content with place holders.
To view the slide layouts, from the right panel, click Layouts.
The layouts available in Impress are displayed.
Look at the layout thumbnails. It gives you an idea of how the slide will appear after the layout has been applied.
There are layouts with titles and two-column formats, layouts where you can position text in three columns and so on.
There are also blank layouts.  You can apply a blank layout to your slide and then create your own layouts.
Let’s apply a layout to a slide.
Select the slide Potential Alternatives and delete all text.
Now, from the Layouts pane on the right-hand side, select Title 2 Content over Content.
The slide now has three text-boxes and a title area.
Notice that the rectangle we inserted using the Master page is still visible.
This rectangle can only be edited using the Master slide.
The settings in the Master-slide override any formatting changes or layouts applied to slides.
Let’s enter content in these boxes now.
In the first text-box, type: "Strategy 1 PRO: Low cost CON: slow action".
In the second text-box, type: "Strategy 2 CON: High cost PRO: Fast Action".
In the third text-box, type:  "Due to lack of funds, Strategy 1 is better".
You can similarly choose the layout type that is most suited to your presentation.
This concludes this tutorial. In this tutorial, we learnt how to apply:Backgrounds for slides Layouts for slides.
Create a new Master Slide.
Create a new background.
Change the layout to title, content over content.
Check what happens when you apply a Layout to a Master slide.
Insert a new slide and apply a blank layout.
Use text-boxes and add columns to it.
Format these text-boxes.
Enter text in these boxes.

This tutorial has been contributed by DesiCrew Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installing Joomla on Windows.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: obtain Joomla,  create database and  install Joomla.
To install Joomla in your system, you should have a system supporting:
Please note that MySQL 6 and higher versions are currently not supported.
Web server distributions give you Apache, MySQL/MariaDB and PHP bundled in one.
You can either install these separately or use a web server distribution like XAMPP, WAMPP or LAMPP.
To record this tutorial, I will be using:  Windows 8 OS,  Joomla 3.7.2,  Apache, MySQL and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.28.
First of all, let us check if XAMPP is installed on our machine.
Click on the Windows icon on the keyboard and type: XAMPP.
If you do not get any result, XAMPP is not installed.
You have to do the XAMPP installation.
Refer to the XAMPP installation tutorial in the PHP & MySQL series on this website.
Follow the instruction given in this tutorial to install the latest version.
While recording this tutorial the latest version is 5.6.28.
I have already installed XAMPP on my machine.
Click on XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking on START button on the respective services.
To stop the services, we have to click on STOP button.
“Apache shutdown unexpectedly”.
Or,  “Port 80 in use for Apache Server'”.
Or,  “Unable to connect to any of the specified MySQL hosts for MySQL database.”
This is because the default ports allotted for Apache and MySQL is taken by other software.
To change these ports, refer to the XAMPP Installation tutorial in the PHP & MySQL series on this website.
Allot proper port numbers before proceeding further.
Once you have installed and started XAMPP, switch to the browser.
In the address bar, type: localhost to see your XAMPP home page.
In the menu on the top right of the page, click on phpinfo().
Now, press CTRL+ F key and search for DOCUMENT underscore ROOT.
It will be something like C:/xampp/htdocs depending on where XAMPP is installed in your machine.
Please make a note of this because we will need to install Joomla in this particular folder.
Now, let us download Joomla.
Go to Joomla official website:
Click on Download & Extend in the top menu.
Click on Joomla Downloads and then click on “Download Joomla 3.7.2 Full Package, ZIP”.
Immediately, a small dialog box will open.
Here click on Save File option. Then click on OK button.
This will download Joomla.
At the time of making of this tutorial, latest stable version is 3.7.2.
I have already downloaded this file and it is in my Downloads folder.
Let us go to the Downloads folder. Here, is the file which we downloaded.
Right-click on the zip file and select Extract All.
Then click on ‘Browse’ to choose the destination.
Now, we have to paste the folder in the webservers root directory.
Browse to the location C:\xampp\htdocs.
Click on ‘Make a new folder’ and type: ‘Joomla’.
Click on OK. Then click on ‘Extract’.
This will create a new folder by name Joomla and extract the contents of the zip file.
Before we go ahead with the installation, we need to create a database for Joomla.
We will do this in phpmyadmin.
Phpmyadmin is the graphical user interface for MySQL.
And it comes along with XAMPP installation.
Switch to the browser and go to the XAMPP homepage.
On the top right of the XAMPP page, you can see a link to phpmyadmin. Click on that.
Click on User accounts in the top menu. Scroll down and then click on Add User account.
Enter a username, say, Joomla hyphen 1
From Host dropdown list, select Local.
Enter a password in the Password text-box, say joomla123.
You can enter any password of your choice.
Enter the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Please do not respond to Generate Password prompt for now.
Under Database for user account, we can see the option,“Create a database with the same name and grant all privileges.”
We will check that option and scroll down to the bottom of the page.
Click the button Go at the bottom right of this page.
This will create a new database with the name Joomla hyphen 1 and  with a user Joomla hyphen 1.
These will be required later to complete the Joomla installation.
To have different names, you can first create the database and then create a user for that database.
We are now ready to install Joomla.
We have XAMPP running and our database is ready.
And we have extracted Joomla into the folder joomla, in DOCUMENT underscore ROOT.
Go to the browser.
In a new tab, type: localhost slash Joomla.
Please note that Joomla is the folder into which we extracted.
Press Enter and you will see the Joomla installation page.
By default, we are in step number one, that is, Configuration.
Joomla can be installed in multiple languages.
We will select English (United states) here.
Scroll down to see the Main Configuration section.
Enter the Site name that you want your website to have.
I will have it as "Digital India".
We will leave the description blank.
Email-id is a compulsory field. Please enter a valid email-id here.
I will give the id as "priyanka@spoken-tutorial.org".
Next, enter the username that you want for the Joomla Administrative page.
I will enter the username as admin.
Enter a password for the Joomla Administrator.
I will enter admin123 as my admin password.
Re-type the password in the confirmation box.
In Site Offline (Yes/No), please select No.
Now, click on the Next button at the bottom-right.
So, we come to the Database Configuration page now.
Select "MySQL" as the Database Type.
Enter "localhost" as the Host Name.
Now, we have to enter the username, password and database names.
These are the ones we created earlier, in phpmyadmin.
I will enter Joomla hyphen 1 as the username.
Note capital letter J in joomla.
Then joomla123 as the password
and Joomla hyphen 1 as the database name.
Leave the Table Prefix as it is.
In Old Database Process, select Backup.
This is to take backup of tables with identical names as in the database, when Joomla is upgraded.
Click on Next button at the bottom right.
We are now in the Finalisation and Overview page.
In the Finalisation section, locate Install Sample Data.
By default, one of the radio buttons will be selected.
The options listed here, will install some sample articles, menus, plugins etc. on the site.
These are useful for a beginner to understand Joomla.
You may choose one of the options, when you are installing Joomla for the first time.
I do not wish to do so. So, I will choose the None option.
Scroll the page below and check the Overview information displayed here.

Hello everybody.
Welcome to this tutorial on Control Execution in KTurtle.
'while' loop  and
'for' loop.
We assume that you have basic working knowledge of Kturtle.
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website:
In the Search bar, type: "kturtle".
Click on the option. KTurtle Application opens.
Let me first explain about what is control execution.
Control execution is controlling the flow of a program.
Different conditions are used to control program execution.
Loop is a block of code,  executed repeatedly till a certain condition is satisfied.
e.g. “while” loop and  “for” loop.
Let's begin the tutorial with “while” loop.
In  the “while” loop, the code inside the loop repeats till Boolean evaluates to "false".
Let me explain the structure of “while” loop:
I already have the code in a text-editor.
Let me copy the program from text editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred.
It means, this line will not be executed while running the program.
reset command sets “Turtle” to its default position.
$x=0 initializes the value of variable 'x' to zero.
Message in a program is given within double quotes after the keyword  "message". “message” command takes string as input.
It shows a pop-up dialog-box containing text from the string.
while $x<30 checks the “while” condition,
$x=$x+3 increments the value of  variable $x by 3.
fontsize 15  sets the font-size used by print command.
forward 20 commands Turtle to move 20 steps forward on the canvas.
print $x displays the value of variable 'x' on the canvas.
Let me click on the Run button to run the program.
Multiples of 3, from 3 to 30, are displayed on the canvas.
Turtle moves 20 steps forward on the canvas.
Let's next work with “for” loop.
“for” loop is a counting loop.
Every time  the code inside for loop is executed,
variable value is incremented till it reaches the end value.
Let me explain the structure of “for” loop.
for variable = start number to end number { Statement}
Let me clear the current program.
Let me type "clear" command and run to clean the canvas.
Let me copy the program from text-editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred.
$r=0 initializes the value of variable 'r' to zero.
for $x= 1 to 15 checks “for” condition  from 1 to 15.
$r=$x*($x+1)/2 calculates the value of variable 'r'.
print $r displays the value of  variable 'r'  on the canvas.
forward 15 commands Turtle to moves 15 steps forward on the canvas.
go 10,250 commands Turtle to go 10 pixels from left of canvas and 250 pixels from top of canvas.
“Turtle” displays all print commands without any time gap.
“Wait 2” command makes Turtle to wait for 2 seconds, before executing next command.
“print” command displays the string within double quotes and also displays variable '$r'.
Let me click on the  Run button to run the program.
A series of sum of first 15 natural numbers and  "Sum of first 15 natural numbers" are displayed on the canvas.
Turtle moves 15 steps forward on the canvas.
In this tutorial, we have learned to use
“while” loop and “for”  loop.
As an assignment, I would like you to write programs to evaluate-
Multiples of 2 using “while” loop.
Multiplication table of a number using “for” loop.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Conditional statements in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
How to execute a single statement
How to execute group of statements.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10.
Let us start with the introduction to conditional statements.
A statement in a program controls the flow of program execution.
It helps to make decision on what code is to be executed.
We can check the conditions, whether true or false.
We can execute a single statement or a group of statements.
Let us understand the flow of if statements.
Here, if the condition is true then statement 1 will be executed.
If the condition is false then statement 2 will be executed.
Now we will see the flow of else if statement.
Here, if condition 1 is true then statement 1 will be executed.
If condition 1 is false then it will check for another condition that is condition 2.
If condition 2 is true then statement 3 will be executed.
And If condition 2 is false then statement 2 will be executed.
Now Let us move on to our program.
Note that our file name is ifstmt.c.
In this program we will calculate the sum of two numbers and will check a few conditions.
Here we have declared three integer variables a, b and sum.
Here we are asking for user input.
User will enter the values of a and b.
The values will be stored in variable a and variable b.
The scanf() function reads data from the console.
It then stores the result in the given variable.
The format specifier in the scanf() helps to know the type of data.
Like here we have %d, it denotes that we are dealing with integer data type.
Here we add the values of a and b.
We will store the result in sum.
This is our if statement.
Here, we check the condition whether sum is greater than 20.
If the condition is true, then we print Sum is greater than 20.
Now let me comment out these lines.
This is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
First we will see the execution of if statement.
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
To compile, type gcc space ifstmt dot c space  -o space if and press Enter.
To execute,  type ./if (dot slash if). Press Enter.
It is displayed as Enter the values of a and b.
I will give the values as 10 and 12.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 22. Sum is greater than 20.
We will check another condition.
Let me remove the comment from here.
I will give the comment here.
Now click on Save.  This is our else-if statement.
Here, we check another condition whether Sum is greater than 10.
If the condition is true then we print 'Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20'.
It is displayed as
Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 10 and 2.
The output is displayed as: Sum of a and b is 12.
Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20.
I will remove the comment from here and here. Now click on Save.
If both the above conditions are false then we print 'Sum is less than 10'.
This is our else statement.
Now let us execute and see.  Come back to our terminal.
Here it is displayed as Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 3 and 5.
The output is displayed as sum of a and b is 8.
Sum is less than 10.
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.
Suppose, here at the end of if statement I will type a semicolon (;).
Let us see what will happen. Click on Save.
We see an error:  'else' without a previous 'if'
Come back to our program. It is a syntax error.
if statement will never terminate with a semicolon.
And the else if statement will never work without an if.
Let us fix the error. Delete the semicolon (;) here.
Now Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to the terminal.
Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 3 and 6.
Sum of a and b is 9. Sum is less than 10.
NOW WE WILL SEE HOW TO EXECUTE THE SAME PROGRAM IN C++.
Press Shift, Ctrl and S  keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension dot cpp and click on  Save.
We will change the header file as iostream.
Let us include the using statement here.
Now click on the Search for and replace text option.
Let us replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Click on Replace all and click on Close.
Now delete the closing brackets here.
Replace the scanf() statement with the cin statement.
Type cin and two closing angle brackets >>.
As we use cin >> function to read a line in C++.
Now delete the format specifiers.
Delete the comma and ampersand &.
Delete the comma here and type two closing angle brackets.
Again delete the ampersandand the closing brackets. Now click on Save.
Here delete the closing bracket and the comma.
Now delete the backslash n (\n) and format specifier.
Now type two opening brackets.
Again type two opening angle brackets  and within the double quotes type backslash n “\n”.
Here also we will delete the closing bracket.
Now again delete the closing bracket here and here.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute.
Come back to the terminal. Let me clear the prompt.
To compile, type g++ space ifstmt.cpp space -o space if1
Here we have 'if1' because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter if for the file 'ifstmt.c'.
Now Press 'Enter'.To execute type ./if1 (dot slash if1) and press Enter.
Enter the value of a and b. I will give the values as 20 and 10.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 30
Sum is greater than 20
Now come back to our slides.
In this tutorial we learned 'if' statement eg. if(condition),
And 'else if' statement eg. else if(condition).
As an assignment, Write a program to check 'a' is greater than 'b' or less than 'b'.
Hint: use 'if' statement.
Write another program to check which value is greater 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
Hint: use 'else-if' statement.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Creating Curves and Polygons in LibreOffice Draw.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to work with Polygons and Curves in Draw.
For this tutorial, you should have basic  knowledge of LibreOffice Draw. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit this website.
Here, we are using:Ubuntu Linux, version 10.04 and LibreOffice Suite, version 3.3.4.
What are polygons? The term poly means many. A many-sided figure is called a polygon.
We will learn how to a draw a map as shown in this slide. This map shows the route from the house to the school.
At the end of this  tutorial, you will be able to create a similar diagram by yourself.
Let us switch to Draw. I have named this file as "RouteMap" and saved it on the Desktop.
First of all, let us enable the Grid view. To do so, click on View, select Grid and choose Display Grid.
Before we begin drawing, let us set the Page margins and the Page orientation.
Place the cursor on the Draw page and right-click for the Context menu.
Select Page and click Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog-box appears.
Click on the Format drop-down and select A4. Select Orientation as Portrait.
The Left, Right, Top and Bottom margins are set to 1. Click OK.
Let us set the default font size to 24.
From the Main menu, select Format and Character.
The Character dialog-box appears.
Click the Font tab and in the Size field, scroll down and select 24. Click OK.
This will ensure that the text we type inside the shapes are clearly visible.
Now, let us begin by drawing the house.
Let’s insert a square to show the house and type "Home" inside it.
Next, let’s draw the park to the right of the house.
The park is an odd-shaped rectangle; the width on the left side is greater than the right side.
Let’s use a polygon to represent it. To draw a polygon, go to the Drawing toolbar.
Click on Curve and then click on the small black arrow next to the icon.
Now, select Polygon filled.
Place the cursor on the Draw page. Hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor down. Release the mouse button.
We have drawn a straight line. Drag the mouse to the right until the shape is that of a right triangle.
Click the left mouse button and drag the mouse upward. Now, double-click the left mouse button.
You have drawn a polygon. Let’s type "Park" inside it.
Next to the Park, there is a Commercial Complex. This too is an odd-shaped polygon. Let’s draw it!
Go to the Drawing toolbar. Click on the small black arrow next to the Curve icon and click on Polygon filled.
Place the cursor on the Draw page. Hold the left mouse button and drag it down.
Now, release the mouse button. You see a straight line. Move the mouse to the left until the shape is that of a triangle.
Click the left mouse-button and drag the mouse upward. Now, hold down the Shift key and drag the cursor inwards.
Double-click the left mouse-button.
You have drawn yet another polygon. Let us type the text "Commercial Complex" inside it.
Following the previous steps, let's draw a parking lot. From the Drawing toolbar, let’s select Polygon filled. And then place the cursor on the Draw page and draw the polygon.
Now, let us type the text "Parking Lot" inside it.
Remember, you can draw a polygon with as many sides as you want.
Pause this tutorial and try this assignment. Draw five-sided, six-sided and ten-sided polygons.
A Residential Complex is right next to the house and is rectangular in shape.
From the Drawing toolbar, select Rectangle.
Then, place the mouse on the Draw page and drag to draw a rectangle.
We will name it "Residential Complex".
There is also a Play Ground in this locality. This is in the shape of a really long rectangle.
From the Drawing toolbar, select Polygon 45 degree Filled.
Place the cursor on the Draw page. Click and drag the left mouse-button down and release it.
Click and move the mouse to the right and release it. Now, click and drag the mouse upward to complete the rectangle.
Double-click the left mouse-button.
You have drawn yet another polygon!
Let us type the text "Play Ground" inside it.
Now, let’s draw the Lake next to the playground.
From the Drawing toolbar, select  Freeform Line filled.
In the Draw page, press the left mouse-button and rotate the mouse in an anti-clockwise direction. Release the left mouse-button.
We have drawn a lake. Let’s type "Lake" inside it.
The last building in this area is the School.' The School campus is also in the form of a polygon.
Let’s draw this on our map now. Again from the Drawing toolbar, let us select Polygon 45 degree filled.
Next, let us place the cursor on the Draw page and draw the polygon. Finally, let’s double-click the mouse when the polygon has been completed.
Let’s type "School Campus" inside it.
Let’s insert a text-box and type the text "School Main Gates" inside it.
Let’s rotate the text-box and place it in the correct position.
Now, from the Main menu, select Modify and click Rotate.
Notice that the handles change to the color red. This implies that we are in the Rotate mode.
Can you see the small arc with arrows on either side? We use this to rotate the box.
Let’s place the cursor over the last handle on the top right corner of the text-box.
The Rotation curve appears.
Press the left mouse-button. Drag the curve in a clock-wise direction until it is placed in the correct position.
Now, click anywhere on the Draw page to exit the 'Rotate' mode.
Let’s also show the side entrance to the school.
Like in the previous step, let’s draw a text-box, enter the text "School Side Entrance" inside it.
Now, let’s draw directions using arrows. From the house, we have to turn right.
From the Drawing toolbar, let’s select Line Ends with Arrow.
Let’s move to the Draw page and draw the line.
Then walk past the Residential Complex and take a left.
Let’s draw another line to show this route.
Then, next to the Play Ground take the right, walk down.
Then take a right again to reach the School’s main gate.
We have drawn our first route. You would have noticed that two types of curves and polygons can be drawn.
One is using the Filled option and the other is without a fill. When you use the Filled option, the curve is filled with color.
You would have also noticed that each of the options in the Curve toolbar has a different method of mouse operation to draw the curve.
Here is an assignment for you. Draw curves and polygons using all the options in the Curve toolbar.
Notice, how the shape of the cursor and the mouse operations change with each selection of the curve or the polygon.
Check if you can change the fill color in the option Filled.

And now that's pretty easy to spot.
For example - let's put an "a" in front of that.
Now the next one I will show you is the "missing page".
And this is the purpose of indentation and the usefulness of indentation.
So, if you miss out characters, you will find that you get weird places for the errors.
I have used the error_reporting(E_ All) just to demonstrate this.

Welcome to this tutorial on Build an Atom simulation.
In this tutorial, we will
Java version 1.7.0
Firefox Web Browser Version 53.02.2
Using this simulation, students will be able to: Build an atom using protons, neutrons and electrons.
Identify an element and its position on the periodic table.
Determine whether an atom is neutral or an ion.
Determine the mass of an atom or ion.
Determine the stability of atom or ion created.
Represent the atomic symbols.
Create isotopes of an element.
Atoms are fundamental building blocks of matter.
Each atom consists of a small, dense, positively-charged nucleus.
Nucleus is surrounded by much lighter, negatively-charged electrons.
Nucleus may also contain neutrons.
Neutron has same mass as proton but it has no charge.
Number of protons in the nucleus of an atom defines the chemical element.
Chemical properties of an element arise due to number & arrangement of electrons.
Let us get started.
I have already downloaded Build an Atom simulation to my Downloads folder.
To open the simulation, right click on build-an-atom html file.
Select Open With Firefox Web Browser option. File opens in the browser.
This is the interface of Build-an-Atom simulation.
The interface has 3 screens-
Let us begin our simulation with Atom screen.
Click on Atom screen.
Using this screen, students can- build atoms, determine the identity, net-charge and mass of an atom.
Atom screen shows a Bohr's model of an atom.
It shows position of nucleus and 2 orbits.
At the bottom of the screen, there are 3 containers with  Protons,  Neutrons and Electrons.
On the right-side, there are 3 panels- Element, Net charge and Mass Number.
To open the panel, click on the green plus sign located on top-right corner on each panel.
This allows you to view the changes as you change the number of particles.
At the bottom of the screen, you will see Show box.
The top left corner of the screen shows a box.
It shows the number of Protons, Neutrons and Electrons, we have used to create the atom.
Let us start by building Hydrogen atom.
From the Proton container, click on the Proton.
Drag and drop on the X mark, which represents the nucleus of an atom.
Simultaneously observe the changes in each of the panels.
Hydrogen atom is the simplest of all elements.
It has one electron in the first orbit and one proton in the nucleus.
Drag an Electron and place in the first orbit.
By default, the orbits are shown as circular dashed lines.
Under Model heading, click on Cloud radio button.
This will show the orbit as electron cloud.
Click on Orbits radio button to show the default orbits.
Observe all the panels on the screen.
Element box shows Hydrogen as Element.
Net charge is zero and is labeled as neutral atom.
It also shows that the atom is Stable.
Now add one more Proton to the nucleus. The atom is shown as Unstable Helium Ion.
Add one more Electron in the 1st orbit.
Now it is a Neutral atom but the atom is still labelled as Unstable.
Add a Neutron to the nucleus. The atom is now Stable.
The Mass Number shows 3, but we know that atomic mass of helium is 4.  So, add another Neutron to the nucleus.
This completes the atomic structure of Helium atom.
Helium atom has 2 Protons, 2 Neutrons and 2 Electrons.
We can add Neutrons to the nucleus, to create isotopes of the same element.
Atoms of the same element that differ in neutrons are called isotopes.
Isotopes of same element have same chemical properties.
Remove one Proton, one Electron and 2 Neutrons from the Helium atom.
Now we have hydrogen atom, also called Protium.
Let us create isotopes of Hydrogen.
Hydrogen has three isotopes. Protium, Deuterium and Tritium.
Nucleus of Protium contains only one Proton.
Deuterium has one Proton and one Neutron.
Tritium has one Proton and 2 Neutrons.
Add one Neutron to the nucleus. Deuterium atom is created.
It is Stable. Add another Neutron to the nucleus to create tritium.
Tritium is unstable, as shown here.
As an assignment: Create a neutral carbon atom. Show isotopes of carbon.
Click on reset button at the bottom-right corner.
This will reset the screen to default settings.
Next, click on Symbol screen at the bottom of the interface.
Using this screen, students can interpret atomic symbols.
Notice that a Symbol panel is added on the screen.
Atom of every element is represented by a symbol.
It gives information about atomic number, mass number and charge.
The subscript number is called the atomic number.
The superscript number is called the mass number.
Charge on the atom is shown on the top-right corner.
The number of protons in an atom is its atomic number.
The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is its mass number.
Add Protons, Neutrons and Electrons to the atom.
Observe the Symbol panel.
Note the change in name of Element, atomic number, Mass Number and charge.
Now we will move on to the Game screen.
Click on Game screen at the bottom of the interface.
Four different games are available.
These games will test the knowledge gained using this simulation.
A timer and a sound button are provided at the bottom-left corner of the screen.
Click on the timer button to enable the timer before the game starts.
We can also control the sound by clicking on the sound symbol.
Click on each game screen and explore.
In this tutorial, we have learnt: how to use Build an Atom, interactive PhET simulation.
Using this simulation, we have learnt to - Build models of Hydrogen and Helium atoms.
Add or remove electrons to create ions.
Add or remove neutrons to create isotopes.
As an assignment: create a neutral oxygen atom.
Add two electrons to the neutral atom.
Observe the change in parameters on various panels.
Try to remove electrons from the inner shells, observe the results.

Hello friends. Welcome to the tutorial on Other types of plots
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to -
To practice this tutorial, you should know how to
Let us initialise the pylab package. Type percent pylab and press Enter.
In a scatter plot, the data is displayed as a collection of points.
Each point determines its position on the x and y axes
Plot a scatter plot showing the percentage profit of a company A from the year 2000 to 2010.
The data for the same is available in the file company hyphen a hyphen data dot txt.
company hyphen a hyphen data dot txt file is available in the code file link of this tutorial.  Please download and use it.
Let us see the content of the file company hyphen a hyphen data dot txt.
So type,cat company hyphen a hyphen data dot txt. and press Enter
The data file has two columns with a set of values in each column.
The first column represents the years. And the second column represents the profit percentage.
To produce the scatter plot, we first need to load the data from the file using loadtxt command.
So Type
unpack equal to True returns the transposed array of data
scatter() function is used to generate the scatter graph
Syntax: scatter within parentheses x comma y
Let us use scatter function to plot scatter graph for data stored in year and profit.
So Type scatter within parentheses year comma profit and press Enter.
Notice that we passed two arguments to scatter() function.
The First one being the values in x-coordinate that is year. Second, the values in y-coordinate, the profit percentages.
Pause the video here, try out the following exercise and resume the video. Read the documentation of scatter.
Plot a scatter plot of same data in company hyphen a hyphen data dot txt with red diamond markers.
Solution to Exercise Clear the plot window by typing clf parentheses and press Enter
Now type
Thus, we got our scatter plot. Now let us see another kind of plot.
A log-log plot is a two-dimensional graph of numerical data.
It uses logarithmic scales on both axes.
Graph appears as straight line due to non-linear scaling
Syntax
Plot a log-log chart of y equal to 5 times x cube for x from 1 to 20.
Before we actually plot, let us calculate the points needed for that.
Type  x equalto linspace within parentheses 1 comma 20 comma 100 and press Enter
Then, y equal to 5 into x raised to 3 and press Enter
Clear the plot window by typing clf parentheses and press Enter
Type loglog within parentheses x comma y and press Enter
We see the required plot
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial we learnt to,
scatter within parentheses x comma y comma color equal to within single quotes blue comma marker equal to within single quotes d
and plot within parentheses x comma y comma color equal to within single quotes b comma marker equal to within single quotes d
does exactly the same?
And the answer, False. Both functions do not produce the same kind of plot.

Write Set operations
Write Factorials and
Cross reference equations by numbering.
For this, let us first open our example 'Writer' document that we created in our previous tutorials "MathExample1.odt".
Here, let us go to the end of the document and press Control, Enter to go to a new page.
And type “Set Operations: ” and press  Enter twice.
Now, let us call Math.
Before we go ahead, let us increase the Font-size to 18 point.
Change the Alignment to the Left.
Let us now learn how to write Set operations.
Math has separate mark up to represent Sets which are collections of distinct elements.
Let us write four (4) example sets, in the Formula Editor window, as shown on the screen:
Set A with 5 elements,
Set B,Set C,
and Set D with elements each.
Notice that to write the brackets for sets, we can use the mark up: lbrace and rbrace.
Now, we can write set operations such as unions and intersections.
First, let us write a union operation.
The mark-up for B union C is the same as we read it;
and the resulting set is 1, 2, 6, 4 and 5 which includes all the distinct elements in both sets.
The markup for an intersection operation is again the same as we read it.
The intersection includes only the common elements from both the sets.
So, the result of B intersection D is 6.
And we can also write: set C is a subset of set A, as every element in 'C' is in set A.
The mark up for this is C subset A.
You can learn to write more set operations by exploring the Elements window, by clicking on the third icon there.
Go to View > Elements > Set Operations.
Let us save our work now.
Click on File > Save.
Now, let us write Factorial functions.
We will designate numbers 1 to 3 for the three formulae we are going to write shortly.
These will help to cross reference them anywhere within the Writer document.
Let us go to a new page by clicking three times slowly, outside the Writer gray box.
Press Control, Enter.
Type: “Factorial Function: ” and press Enter twice.
Now, we know how to call Math.
But, there is another way to bring up the Math object into the Writer.
For this, simply write ‘f n’ on the Writer document and press F3.
We are now seeing a new Math object that says E is equal to m c squared
and along with that the number one (1), within parentheses, on the right.
Meaning- we can cross reference this formula with the number 1, anywhere in this document.
We will learn the details of how to do this later.
For now, let us double-click on the Math object.
And do the formatting. Font size 18 and 'Left' Alignment.
Okay, let us now write an example for Factorial.
The mark up ‘fact’ represents the factorial symbol.
So, let us overwrite the existing formula with ours:
5 Factorial = 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 = 120.
Let us write our next formula in a new Math object here.
For this, let us first click outside this Writer gray box three times slowly.
Press the down-arrow key two or three times to go to the end of this page.
And type ‘f n’ and press F3 to bring up the second Math object.
Again, we will repeat the formatting
and overwrite the existing formula with the factorial definition:
n factorial is equal to prod from k = 1 to n of k.
Notice the mark-up ‘prod’ which denotes product, similar to sigma for summation.
Now, let us introduce a third Math object just like the first two
and rewrite the factorial definition as two conditional formulae, as shown on the screen.
Notice the mark up ‘binom’ which displays a vertical stack of two elements and helps with better alignment.
Let us now see how we can cross reference these formulae.
For this, let us go to a new page
and type: "An example of factorial is provided here:"
Now, let us click on the Insert menu and on Cross reference.
In the new pop-up, let us select Text in the Type list.
Then choose the first item in the Selection list denoting the first factorial formula we wrote.
Now choose Reference in the ‘Insert reference to’ list and click on Insert once and close.
So, the number one (1) in parentheses has appeared next to our text. And we are done.
Let us test it by simply clicking on this number
and notice that the cursor has jumped to the location where we wrote the first formula.
So, this is how we can cross reference Math formulae anywhere within the Writer document.
Let us save our work.
Here are some reference links for Math:

Welcome to this tutorial on Plotting bar charts and scatter plot.
Plot bar charts
Plot scatter plot
Find the correlation coefficient between two objects.
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Data frames in R
Basics of Statistics
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A data frame moviesData.csv
A script file barPlots.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to Plots folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set Plots folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
Open the script barPlots.R in RStudio.
Run this script by clicking on Source button.
movies data frame opens in the Source window.
It has 600 observations of 31 variables.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
This will enable us to see the remaining objects of movies data frame.
Now, we will learn how to draw a bar chart of the object named imdb underscore rating in  movies.
A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars with length of the bar proportional to the value of  the variable.
R uses the function barplot to create bar charts.
Let us switch to RStudio.
For the sake of simplicity, we are considering only the first 20 observations of movies to  draw a bar chart.
Click on the script barPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
Let me resize the Source window.
moviesSub with 20 observations is loaded in the Environment.
Now, we draw a bar chart of imdb_rating for these movies.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have used the following arguments:
moviesSub dollar sign imdb underscore rating is the data for plotting
ylab and xlab for adding labels to the respective axes.
col to set the color of bins
ylim to set the range of values on Y-axis
main for adding a title to the bar chart.
Run the current line.
The bar chart is displayed with Movies on X-axis and their imdb_rating on Y-axis.
In the Plots window, click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
This particular movie has an IMDB rating of approximately 6.
Similarly, this particular movie has an IMDB rating of approximately 8.
However, we do not know the name of the movies.
So, we will add more arguments in barplot function to show the names of movies on X-axis.
Close this plot.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have used the argument names.arg and set it to title.
Remember, title column in moviesSub contains the names of movies.
Run the current line.
In the Plots window, click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
Now, the names of movies are displayed on the X-axis.
But not for all movies.
This is due to the point that the names are too long to be accommodated.
That’s why, we will make these names perpendicular to X-axis.
Close this plot.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have used las argument.
las equal to 2 produces labels which are at right angles to the axis.
Run the current line.
In the Plots window, click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
Now the names for all the movies are displayed on X-axis.
For example, Filly Brown has an IMDB rating of approximately 6.
However, longer names are being truncated.
We can add more arguments to barplot function for adjusting labels.
For more information, please refer to the Additional Material section on this website.
Close this plot.
In the Source window, click on movies.
Let us analyze the relation between imdb underscore rating
and audience underscore score.
For this, we will draw a scatter plot with these two objects by using plot function.
Remember, we have already learnt how to plot a single object.
Scatter plot is a graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along two axes.
The pattern of the resulting points reveals the correlation.
Let us switch to RStudio.
In the Source window, click on the script barPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have kept imdb underscore rating on the X-axis and audience underscore score on the Y-axis.
As imdb underscore rating of any movie varies between 0 and 10,
we have set the range of values on X-axis from 0 to 10.
Similarly, we have set the range of values on Y-axis from 0 to 100.
Save the script and run the current line.
In the Plots window, click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
We can observe that the movies having higher imdb underscore rating has a high audience underscore score.
Close this plot.
Now we will learn how to calculate the correlation coefficient between imdb underscore rating and audience underscore score.
For this, we use cor function.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
The correlation coefficient between imdb underscore rating and audience underscore score is evaluated as 0.865.
The value of correlation coefficient is always between -1 and +1.
A positive value indicates that the variables are positively related.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to:
Plot bar charts
Plot scatter plot
Find the correlation coefficient between two objects
We now suggest an assignment.
Read the file moviesData.csv.
Create a bar chart of critics underscore score for the first 10 movies.
Create a scatter plot of imdb underscore rating and imdb underscore num underscore votes to see their relation.
Save both the plots.
Please contact us.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on POST variable. Here I am going to use the same code as that of the get.php page, the same one that I have done in my GET variable tutorial.
If you have not seen that already, please do so and then go through this tutorial. You will be able to know  all these codes about.
If you already know these codes about and you have not seen the GET tutorial, you are welcome to join us.
I have got my page with my get as previous.
I have got a new file called 'post.php'
Actually, what I want to do is change this as POST and post it as a post variable.
So, quite simply and logically I will just go through this and change this to POST
and here is what we call 'POST' instead of 'GET' and this will work.
Let me show you my post page.
There is nothing here. There is no question mark.
Let me type "Alex" and click here. But nothing has come up.
That is why,
do you remember if you are working with another file, you need to change the action.
Let's refresh it.
I can see "Alex". Let me click here and this is "Hello, Alex".
Next, we are in the 'post.php' font and there is no question mark.
Something has been taken across. It has been stored inside a post variable.
But why it is not showing two users?
This will be absolutely brilliant if we can say 'password'. Let's call this 'password'.
I'll say here "Thanks for your password" and let's go back.
And now, as you can see, this is a password field;
so I'll type 123 as my password and I click here.
It says, "Thanks for your password".
It has been stored. so it can be used. I can use it, if I want to.
I'll just change that; so it makes more sense.
Let's do a refresh and resend the data.
123, click here and it's not displaying. That's why
you should check these things. It is easy to make mistakes.
Let me type 123. Let me click here and it says "Thanks for your password" and it has given me my password.
It proves that it has been carried across, it has been stored in a post variable.
But it hasn't shown the user which could have made sense
because there would be no point having these as blocks. They are not readable in any way.
And here, there would no point having it because people can read our password.
So, it will be very easy for people to look through your internet history
and see you have typed your password. But people might get access to your account with that.
So you can see this post. These are used for functions, also the amount that can be sent through it.
So, if for example, my password was really long say over 100 characters, it will still be accepted
but in the 'get' variable you have a hundred character limit.
So, the post thus seems to be useful. But if you are evaluating things, like trying to sort out some things, you can use the get variable
just to see if your data is being passed through.
So basically that's post variable.
You would be using it a lot on projects for form submissions. This brings us to the end of this tutorial
This is Siddarth for the Spoken Tutorial Project. Thanks for watching.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
This is our main function.
Now click on Save.
Let us delete this.No need to initialize a and b here.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Inclined Plane.
In this tutorial we will learn to,
Simulate the motion of a load on an inclined plane.
Resolve the vector components using basic trigonometry.
Calculate the vector components.
Here I am using,
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For the pre-requisites tutorials please visit this site.
Let us define an inclined plane.
An inclined plane, is a flat supporting surface tilted at an angle.
It has one end higher than the other.
It is used for raising or lowering a load.
Use of an inclined plane provides greater mechanical advantage.
Examples of an inclined plane are ramps, slides, stairs, water slides and others.
Use the given link to download the Apps.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
After downloading, html5phen folder appears in the Downloads folder.
Double click on html5phen folder.
Now double-click on the phen folder.
In this folder, we see Apps in java script and htm format.
We will use the Apps with htm file format.
To open Inclined Plane press Ctrl, F keys simultaneously.
In the search bar type inclined plane.
Right click on inclinedplane_en.htm file.
Select the option Open With Firefox web Browser.
Inclined Plane App opens in the browser.
This is the interface of Inclined plane.
The green panel shows different parameters that we can change.
Reset button on the top of the green panel helps to edit values.
The yellow Start button is a toggle button for Start/Pause and Resume.
Slow motion check-box is used to observe the motion steadily.
Then we have Springscale and Force vectors radio buttons.
Click on Start button.
Notice that a load is pulled by the springscale.
Click on the Pause button.
Now select Force vectors radio button.
Observe that there are five arrows pointing in different directions.
We can change the values of: Angle of inclination, Weight and Coefficient of friction in the white colour boxes.
Note that these values can be changed within certain limits.
Click on Reset button.
Here we can change the Angle of inclination from 0 degrees to 90 degrees.
Let’s change the Angle of inclination to 45 degrees and press Enter.
Now click on Start button.
When the load reaches the middle of the inclined plane click on Pause button.
Notice that the pink vector shows the force of gravity(mg).
It tries to pull the load towards the center of the Earth.
The blue and red vectors are the resolution vectors of gravity.
The red vector is perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane.
The blue vector is parallel to the surface of the inclined plane.
If theta(θ) is 45 degrees, then this angle is 90 degrees.
From the triangle’s geometry this angle would be (90-θ).
To calculate the magnitude of the forces we need to know theta value.
Now these two lines are parallel and if we assume that this line is a transversal line.
Recall that red vector is perpendicular to the inclined plane.
Here the angle would be 90 degrees.
Let us assume this angle as x.
So 90 minus theta plus 90 plus x equals to 180
Using basic trigonometry we can resolve the parallel and perpendicular components.
Here the blue parallel component is equal to the black line.
Parallel force is Sin theta.
Sin theta equals to F(parallel) upon mg.
Let’s rearrange the equation.
Similarly we can resolve the perpendicular component.
F(perpendicular) equals to mg cos theta.
Let us solve this numerical and verify the answers with the ones shown in the App.
Click on the Reset button to reset the App.
In the App change the values according to the numerical.
First let us convert 1.02 Kg into Newton and enter the value in the Weight box.
Next change the Angle of inclination to 30 degrees and press Enter.
Now click on Start button.
Again click on Pause button when the load reaches the center of the inclined plane.
Observe that the App has calculated the parameters.
Next we will calculate using the formulae.
Calculated value of the parallel component is 4.99 Newton and that of normal component is 8.65 Newton.
And the necessary force is equal to the parallel force but in the opposite direction.
Let us compare the answers with the ones shown in the App.
Observe that the calculated values are comparable to the measured values.
Let's observe the effect of friction.
Click on the Reset button.
In the Coefficient of friction box type 0.5 and press Enter.
Click on the Start button.
When the load reaches the middle of the inclined plane click on Pause button.
Notice that a black vector is added to the blue vector.
In the green panel Force of friction is measured as 4.3 Newton.
Notice that the Necessary force required to pull the load has changed to 9.3 Newton.
This is because the total necessary force is, sum of parallel and frictional forces.
As an assignment solve this numerical and compare your answer with the ones shown in the App.
Let us summarise
Using this App we have  Simulated the motion of a load on an inclined plane.
Resolve the vector components using basic trigonometry.
Calculated the vector components.
These Apps are created by Walter-fendt and his team.

Hello friends and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on how to generate biogas.
In this tutorial, we will learn: * When to add raw material to the Biogas plant.
Quantity of raw material to be added to the biogas plant.
Use of slurry that is generated from the biogas plant and Biogas burner and its connection process.
You will also see testimonial of biogas users.
Recollect, an earlier tutorial that mentioned the raw materials to be added to the biogas plant which were household food waste and cow-dung.
Cow-dung forms a favorable anaerobic environment for generation of biogas.
So, when should the raw materials be added in the biogas plant?
Once the civil work is over, the plant is left for curing for 17 days. On the 18th day, first load of raw materials can be fed into the plant.
As shown in this image, raw material should be fed into the mixing tank through the inlet pipe.
At this point, the important question is how much raw material should be added to the biogas plant?
The answer is- for the first time production of biogas, add approximately 600 kgs of cow-dung.
And, leave it for fermentation for 4 days. After 4 days, add at least 25 kilograms of raw materials daily to the plant.
Along with this, add equal proportion of water. Which means, a ratio of 1:1 has to be maintained.
For example, for 25 Kgs of raw material, 25 litres of water should be added.
Next, we will learn how to add the raw material into the inlet tank.
To add the raw material into the inlet tank- first, mix the raw material and water properly in the ratio of 1:1. And then put this mixture into the feeding tank which is connected to the digester.
Once the digester is completely filled with the mixture, leave the plant for fermentation.
Note that the time required for fermentation depends upon the climatic conditions of the respective region where the biogas plant is set up.
For e.g. fermentation in warmer regions will be quicker as compared to the cooler regions.
So, in warmer regions, leave the raw material in the digester tank for 4-5 days.
Once the fermentation is completed, two things happen simultaneously. Gas being lighter, starts accumulating in the upper part of the dome.
And, pressure generated by the gas pushes the slurry outside.
The different ways to use this slurry are as follows.
It can be directly sent into the farms through drains. It can be manually poured into the nearby fields.
And it can also be dried in drying pits to be used as dry manure.
Next, we will talk about choosing the right burner for using the biogas.
The gas that is generated in the plant is conveyed through the main gas pipe. This main gas pipe should further be connected to an appropriate burner.
So, which burner should be used?
The two types of burners available are- biogas burner and LPG burner.
Please note, an LPG burner should not be used for biogas.
The reason is LPG burners are specifically used for high compression LPG only.
Hence, LPG burners are not advisable for biogas usage.
For using biogas, it is best to buy a burner made of cast-iron due to its durability.
It is to be noted that like LPG stoves, biogas stoves are also available in single and double burner models.
Single burner stove is of 8 cubic feet size
and Double burner stove is of 16 cubic feet size.
So, where to procure biogas burners from?
To buy the biogas burner, one needs to contact the concerned-state office of Khadi & Village Industries Commission, also known as KVIC.
You can get the further contact details in the downloadable section.
To confirm the generation of biogas, do the following.
Light the burner and check the flame for the biogas.
The gas generated will be sufficient for the cooking needs of a family of 4-5 members.
Some Do’s and Dont’s for running a biogas plant are-
On a daily basis, check flow of the waste from the mixing tank into the Digester tank. Check that the slurry is flowing out of the slurry tank.
Do not keep the mixing tank and slurry tank uncovered.
Some safety measures to be followed when using the biogas burner are:
After every 4-5 days, drain out condensed water, if any. In case, gas is not going to be used for a long time, switch OFF the safety valve.
This will ensure that the gas makes its way out from the outlet tank along with the slurry.
Now you will see testimonial of some happy users. They will mention about how convenient it is to use biogas for cooking
which saves time, money and helps in improving health and hygiene.
Hello, my name is Suresh Sahadev Manjrekar and this is my wife Supriya Suresh Manjrekar. We are a family of five people and we have 2 cows.
Every day I put  25kgs of cow dung mixed in equal quantity of water into this mixing tank of the biogas plant. I have also connected the toilet to the Biogas plant.
You can see the toilet just behind me. Using biogas is very easy. It saves time and money.
Earlier, I used to walk 25 minutes to collect firewood. Now I don’t go anywhere to collect firewood. Also, the slurry that comes out of the plant is collected in a pit which is 2-1/2 feet deep.
The slurry is then directed in a drain towards the fields.  I am very happy using biogas.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt-When to add raw material to the biogas plant Quantity of raw material to be added to the biogas plant.
Different ways to use the slurry Different types of biogas stoves.We also saw testimonials from biogas users.
This video was created by the Spoken tutorial team with inputs from Rural-ICT team, IIT Bombay.
More information on these projects can be found at these links.
This is Bella Tony along with the animation team of the Spoken Tutorial project, signing off.
Hello friends. On behalf of CDEEP, IIT Bombay, I welcome you to this tutorial.
This tutorial will help you master CamStudio through a step-by-step process.
Learning is more effective when animation and narrations are presented simultaneously.
Audio-video demonstrations can illustrate features with maximum clarity.
CamStudio is a screen-recording software that records all activities which you see on your computer screen and allows you to play them back later on.
Which means that you can use CamStudio to -
demonstrate features of a new software
create audio-video tutorials for schools and colleges
create video movies used in user trainings
show how to perform an activity
convert 'AVI' files to 'Flash (SWF)' files and many other uses.
The uses of this little known software are limitless.
CamStudio can be used with Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000 or XP versions.
All you need is a 400 MHz processor, 64 MB of RAM and 4 MB of hard-disk space for program installation.
Camstudio is an open source software and can be downloaded free of cost from the internet. Go to the site:  www.camstudio.org.
This will open the CamStudio website. Scroll down and click on the link to download.
Follow the instructions and you will have downloaded CamStudio on your PC.
Once you have installed CamStudio, double-click on the icon to run it. This will open the CamStudio dialog-box.
You will see the Main Menu right at the top of the window. Under File, you have the option to Record, Stop, Pause and Exit.
You will find the corresponding buttons in the dialog-box as well- the Red button to record, the Grey button to pause and the Blue button to stop the recording.
It is recommended that you set the capture region before recording by defining the area of capture. Under Region, there are 3 capture options.
If you select Region and click on Record then you can draw a rectangular region on your screen within which the capturing will occur.
If you select Fixed Region then you can specify the capture region in pixels.
If you select Full Screen then the entire screen will be captured.
The Enable Autopan feature is a unique feature of CamStudio.
If this option is selected, the capture region will follow the cursor wherever it goes during recording.
This has the effect of making the screen capture to occur at the region with the most action.
You can also set the speed of panning here.
Under Options, you have Video Options where you can select a compressor for the recording so that the video file size is small.
By default, the compressor is Microsoft Video 1.
But, you are free to choose any of the compressors or codecs given in the drop-down box here.
Alternately, you can even download the codecs from the internet depending on your requirement.
Setting the video options allows you to optimize your video recordings by choosing between the file size, quality and frame rates of your video files.
To set the values for Key Frames, Capture Frames and the Playback Rate, first uncheck the Auto Adjust button.
Now, you can set the values according to your requirement. To record this tutorial, I have used 'Microsoft Video 1' as the compressor with 'Key Frames' set to 5, 'Capture Frames' set to 200 and 'Playback Rate' set to 5. I have reduced the Quality to 50.
By trial and error and various permutations and combinations, I have personally found these values suitable in terms of output quality and file size.
Setting cursor options can help focus on the activity you are recording by drawing attention to the area where the action happens.
Under Options, click on Cursor Options in which you have the choice to either hide or show the cursor. By default, Show Cursor is checked.
There are 3 choices of cursors here – the Actual Cursor, the Custom Cursor (you can select from the drop-down box here) or you can load the cursor from the cursors folder present on your computer.
Next, you can highlight the area around the cursor by checking this box.
You can set the size, the shape and the colour of the highlight. Click on OK.
You will not see any change in your cursor but the recorded video will have a custom highlighted cursor. Let me demonstrate this for you.
By default, CamStudio does not record audio. You can record audio from the microphone – a very powerful feature to make audio-video tutorials – by checking this option.
You will need a sound card with an attached microphone to use this option.
You can also record audio from the speakers attached to your computer by checking this option.
There are other options like Program Options which have these sub-options.
Use these options to customize the way  CamStudio behaves when it starts or stops recording.
Ideally check the option to 'Minimize program on Start Recording'.
This will minimize CamStudio onto the system tray which is at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
Right now, you will see 2 CamStudio icons on the system tray.
That’s because I myself am recording this tutorial using CamStudio.
'Record to Flash Options' has these sub-options.
Keyboard Shortcuts is where you will set the HOT KEYS for record, pause, stop and the rest.
You are free to choose any of these.
So, I hope I have given you sufficient information to get you started on CamStudio.
Use this software to make audio-video tutorials and online visual learning modules of your own.
Once you have mastered the basics of CamStudio, you may want to watch the next edition on its advanced features.
Till then, this is Nancy from CDEEP, IIT Bombay, signing off. Thank you for watching.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Pendulum Lab simulation.
In this tutorial we will demonstrate, Pendulum Lab PhET simulation.
Here I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
Firefox web browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial, Learner should be familiar with topics in high school physics.
Using this simulation, we will, Describe simple harmonic motion.
Demonstrate the oscillations of a pendulum.
Investigate the factors that affect the oscillations of a pendulum.
Explain Conservation of energy during motion of the pendulum.
Demonstrate the oscillations for a pair of pendulums.
Demonstrate the oscillations of a pendulum on other celestial bodies.
A simple pendulum has a fixed string attached to a bob.
Now we will define simple harmonic motion.
Simple harmonic motion arises when the force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from its mean position.
That is F α -x .
In SHM there is a continuous interchange of kinetic and potential energies.
Here, mechanical energy is conserved.
I have already downloaded the simulation to my Downloads folder.
Right click on pendulum-lab_en.html file.
Select the option Open with Firefox Web Browser.
Pendulum Lab simulation opens.
In the Pendulum lab simulation, we have three screens Intro ,Energy  ,Lab
Click on Intro screen to open it.
In this screen we have, A blue coloured pendulum.
A Protractor to show the changes in the angle of the pendulum.
A ruler to measure the distance from the fixed point to the centre of mass.
Length and Mass sliders to change the length and mass of the pendulum.
Gravity and Friction sliders to change gravity and friction.
At the bottom left corner of the screen we have grey coloured box.
It has the following check boxes.
A Ruler ,A Stopwatch and A Period Trace.
At the bottom of the screen we have, A Pendulum and a Pair of pendulum buttons.
Stop button to stop the oscillations of the pendulum.
Play/Pause and Step buttons.
Normal or Slow radio buttons to change animation speed.
And a Reset button to reset the simulation.
For the pendulum, reference line on the bob is the centre of mass.
Pendulum’s angle can be changed from 180 to -180 degrees.
Drag the pendulum to a particular angle say 30 degrees and allow to oscillate.
Here, default length of pendulum is 0.70 m.
Now click and drag the Length slider towards left till 0.30 m.
Observe that as we decrease the length, pendulum oscillates faster.
Drag it back to 0.70 m.
The default mass of pendulum is 1 kg.
Click and drag the mass slider towards left till 0.50 kg.
Observe that as we change the mass, it does not affect the oscillations of the pendulum.
Note that Friction slider is at None.
Now click and drag the Friction slider towards Lots.
Observe that the oscillations of the pendulum slow down.
After sometime pendulum stops oscillating.
This is due to increase in friction, as friction damps the oscillations of the pendulum.
Now let us measure time for 10 oscillations at different lengths.
We will make a tabular column, to show length and time for 10 oscillations of a pendulum.
Next select the Stop watch to record the time for 10 oscillations.
We will count 10 oscillations for length 0.70 m.
Click and drag the pendulum at an angle of 30 degrees to count number of oscillations.
Now we will count the 10 oscillations.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Note the value in the table.
To find the mean time taken for 10 oscillations, we need to measure the time for 0.70 m again.
Click on Reset button of the Stop watch to take the count of next 10 oscillations.
Click on Stop button to stop the oscillations.
Change the length to 0.60 m.
Follow the same steps to count 10 oscillations for length 0.60 m.
Here I have already taken the observations for two different lengths.
As an assignment, Change the length of the pendulum to 0.50 m, 0.40 m and 0.30 m.
Count for 10 oscillations.
Note down the time.
Next we will move on to Energy screen.
Click on Energy screen button at the bottom of the interface.
In this screen we will explain how energy is conserved during the oscillations of the pendulum.
Energy screen has almost same tools as that for Intro screen except for the Energy Graph.
Click and drag the pendulum to 60 degrees and allow it to oscillate.
Observe the graph.
From the drop down below Gravity select Jupiter.
Observe the change in graph.
Click on the Slow radio button to see the change in graph during the oscillations of the pendulum.
Here, we observe that at the extreme positions the potential energy is maximum.
At the mean position the kinetic energy is maximum.
Therefore, the total mechanical energy is conserved during the motion.
Click on the Normal radio button.
Now we will see the effect of friction in the graph.
Click and drag the Friction slider towards Lots.
Observe that due to increase in friction there is sudden increase in thermal energy.
After sometime total mechanical energy equals thermal energy.
This is because friction damps oscillations of the pendulum.
Now we will move to Lab screen.
In this screen we have the same tools that are included in previous screens.
Additionally we have velocity and Acceleration check boxes at the top left corner.
And Period Timer instead of Period Trace.
Select the pair of pendulums.
Here, we can see that on the top right corner,  there are two lengths and two mass sliders.
The default length of second pendulum is 1 m.
Default mass is 0.50 kg.
Drag the blue pendulum to 60 degrees and allow it to oscillate.
Similarly, drag the red pendulum.
Note that green colour is for Velocity vector.
And yellow is for Acceleration.
Select Velocity check box.
Select the Slow radio button to observe the velocity vector carefully.
Here, we observe that velocity is maximum at its mean position.
It decreases at the extreme positions.
This is due to maximum kinetic energy at the mean position.
Similarly, let us select Acceleration vector and observe the change in acceleration.
As an assignment, Explain why acceleration is maximum at extreme positions?
Using the pendulum, we will compare calculated and measured Time period for different lengths.
Let us make a tabular column for Length L, Time period T (Calculated) and Time period T (Measured).
We can calculate the time period using formula: T=2π√(l/g)
Where ‘l’ is length and ‘g’ is acceleration due to gravity.
Value of g = 9.81 m/s^2.
Select Period Timer.
On the right side of the screen a Period Timer appears.
Note down 0.70 m in the length column.
Here I have already calculated the time period using the formula.
We will measure the time period from the simulation.
Now click and drag the pendulum to 40 degrees.
Click on the start button of the Period Timer.
Value for time period appears on the screen.
Note the time period in the measured column.
Now change the length to 0.60 m.
Again click on the Period Timer.
Note the value in the table.
As an assignment, Change the lengths of the pendulum to 0.50 m, 0.40 m, and 0.30 m.
Note down the measured Time period.
Calculate the time period using the formula.
Compare the calculated and measured time period values.
Next Reset the simulation.
Drag the pendulum to 30 degrees to oscillate.
Note that acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.81 meter per second square.
Now select Jupiter from the drop down list.
Observe the change in oscillations of the pendulum.
Note that value of acceleration due to gravity on Jupiter is more than that on Earth.
As an assignment, Observe the oscillations on other celestial bodies.
Let us summarise

Welcome to this tutorial on Photoelectric Effect, PhET simulation.
In this tutorial, we will learn- how to use interactive PhET simulation, Photoelectric Effect.
To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with topics in high-school science.
Java version 1.7.0,
Using this simulation, students will be able to-
2. Determine Threshold frequency.
3. Find Stopping potential and Work function.
4. Study the factors affecting current and energy of electrons.
When light of a particular frequency strikes a metal surface, electrons are ejected.
Ejected electrons are counted by a detector that measures their kinetic energy.
I have already downloaded the Photoelectric Effect simulation to my Downloads folder.
Open the terminal.
Then type: java space hyphen jar space photoelectric_en.jar and press Enter.
Photoelectric Effect simulation opens.
Do not close the terminal, it will kill the process.
Click Cancel to continue.
This is the interface of Photoelectric Effect simulation.
This screen has a menu bar with menu items- File, Options and Help.
Options menu has two options, Show photons and Control photon number instead of intensity.
Screen has a lamp to shine light on the metal surface.
We can change Intensity and wavelength by dragging the respective sliders.
We can also input Intensity and wavelength values in their respective boxes.
Photoelectric effect is carried out inside a vacuum chamber.
A vacuum chamber consists of a metal surface and a detector to measure kinetic energy of electrons.
A battery and a current indicator are connected in the circuit.
Battery is provided with a Voltage slider.
A Play/Pause and Step buttons are at the bottom of the screen.
On the right side of the screen, we can see a Target drop down box to choose metals.
By default, Sodium is selected as Target metal.
For accuracy in results, let's move the Intensity slider to 50%.
In Options menu, click on Show photons option.
Observe that light is shined in the form of photons.
Un-check Show photons option.
By default, the wavelength slider is at 400 nano-meter.
Electrons are ejected as soon as light falls on Sodium metal surface.
There is no time lag between incident radiation and electrons emission.
These electrons flow towards a detector.
For 0 V (zero voltage), value of current is shown as 0.071.
Under Graphs, we have the following check boxes -
Current Vs battery voltage,
Current Vs light intensity,
Electron energy Vs light frequency.
Click on Current vs battery voltage check box.
We see a graph of current vs battery voltage.
Notice a red dot on the graph.
Drag the voltage slider slowly from 0 to 6.00 volts.
Notice that current remains constant as we increase the voltage.
This is indicated by the red line.
As we increase the voltage, speed of photoelectrons increases.
Let us see how intensity of light affects the current.
Click on Current vs light intensity check box.
Drag the Intensity slider upto 90%.
Notice that current increases linearly with the increase in intensity.
This is indicated by the green line.
Increase in intensity of light increases the magnitude of photoelectric current.
Now Current value is shown as 0.127.
Drag the Intensity slider back to 50%.
Now, click on Electron energy Vs light Frequency graph check box.
Drag the wavelength slider towards UV region.
Notice that energy increases linearly with the increase in Frequency.
This is indicated by the blue line.
Observe the change in current.
Increase in frequency, increases the energy of photoelectrons.
As frequency increases, energy transfer from photons to electrons increases.
This results in increase in the kinetic energy of ejected electrons.
Now click on a Camera icon.
A snapshot window opens.
It gives information about Graphs and Experimental Parameters.
Using this snapshot, we can compare graphs with different settings.
Close the snapshot window.
Now we will discuss how to calculate the Threshold Frequency.
Each metal has a characteristic minimum frequency to cause photoelectric emission.
This frequency is, Threshold Frequency, denoted by ʋ
Below the Threshold Frequency, Photoelectric Effect is not observed.
Drag the wavelength slider towards visible region.
Observe the wavelength at which electron ejection stops.
Notice that at 540 nm no more electrons are ejected from Sodium.
Let's type 539 nm in the wavelength text box and observe.
At 539 nm electrons start ejecting from sodium metal surface.
It means that, 539 nm is threshold wavelength for Sodium.
Here, value of current is 0.00.
Now let us calculate the threshold frequency value.
Here wavelength is shown in nano metres(nm).
I will convert it to metres by multiplying with 10 to the power of -9
Threshold frequency can be calculated using following formula.
Threshold frequency of sodium is 0.56 x 10 to the power of 15 </sup>Hz.
Now let us select Platinum as Target.
Click on drop down arrow and select Platinum.
At this wavelength we do not see ejection of photoelectrons.
Drag the slider to UV region untill electron ejection starts.
Drag the wavelength slider to lower wavelength region.
Notice that a large number of electrons with different energies are ejected.
To view electrons with highest energy, click on Show only highest energy electrons check box.
Uncheck the box to show electrons with different energies.
As an assignment, calculate the Threshold Frequency of Platinum.
We will move on to the calculation of work function and stopping voltage.
Work function is minimum amount of energy necessary to start photoelectric emission.
Different metals have different values of work function.
It is denoted by ϕ
Work function is given by ϕ
Elements with low ionization enthalpy values have low work function.
Let us calculate the work function for Sodium.
Work function is calculated by using following formula.
Work function for Sodium is 2.31 eV.(electron volts)
Similarly work function for Calcium is 2.9 eV (electron volts)
Stopping Potential- It is a negative voltage required to stop electrons from reaching the other side.
At Stopping Potential, photoelectric current becomes zero.
Let's see how to determine the stopping potential for Sodium.
Change Sodium as target metal.
Drag the wavelength slider to threshold wavelength of sodium.
Drag the voltage slider to negative voltage.
At which voltage, electrons will bounce off from detector?
At -0.01 V(volts), electrons start to bounce off from detector.
Observe, at -0.04 Volts, no electrons are ejected from sodium.
As an assignment, calculate the work function for Zinc, Copper and Calcium.
Determine the stopping potential for the same metals.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial we have learnt about,
Using this simulation, we have learnt  about: Photoelectric Effect,
to determine Threshold Frequency,
to find Stopping Potential and Work Function and
study the factors affecting current and energy of electrons.

This tutorial is a continuation of the previous tutorial on Database Design.
And we will learn the following topics here:
7. Refine the database design
8. Apply the normalization rules
9. Test the database design.
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to set up primary keys and foreign keys to establish table relationships.
Let us now continue with the process of 'database design'.
First, we will refine our database design.
Now that we have a preliminary design, we can create and populate the tables with sample data.
We can create sample queries, forms and reports and see if all our initial questions are answered.
We can check for unnecessary duplications and eliminate them by altering the design.
We can add columns that we may have forgotten.
Also, we can include Business rules to the Library database to enforce Database Integrity.
For example, the Price column in the Books table has to be numeric.
Another business rule can be: the Return Date should be one month after the date of issue of a book.
Or, when a specific action occurs, further actions should be triggered.
So, if a book return date is overdue then we should set up actions in the database to send an email reminder to the member.
So, as we redesign, we may introduce- new tables, columns, rules or constraints
and we have to go all  over the previous steps to ensure that the Data Integrity is not lost.
Next, we can apply the normalization rules.
These are used to see if our tables are:
a) structured correctly and
b) free of any modification anomalies that we saw earlier.
The process of applying the rules or normal forms to a database design is called normalization.
Let us see the first three Normal forms in our tutorial.
Let us first see the First Normal Form.
For example, each cell in the Price column in the Books table should have only one value.
Meaning, the column should hold only the price of that book and nothing else.
Similarly, each First Name cell in the Authors table should have only one author’s first name.
First Normal form also says that there are no repeating groups of columns.
As an example, we will suppose that a Publisher has published 3 books.
And the Publishers table structure has the following columns:
Publisher Id, Publisher, Book1, Author 1, Book 2, Author 2, Book 3, Author 3.
Notice the repeating groups: 'Book' and 'Author' three times.
So, if we see such repeating groups, we should revisit our design.
Now, if the publisher publishes ten more books, we are forced to change the table structure by adding 20 columns.
So, we see that the table design is not stable as data changes.
Also, searching and sorting the table by book or author will become cumbersome.
So, we solve this flaw by splitting the table into two or three tables.
In our example, we will split the above table into Publishers, Books and Authors as shown in the image on the screen.
This design brings the table to the First Normal Form
and keeps the table structures stable as data on publishers and books keep changing.
Let us see the Second Normal Form now.
A 'table' is said to be in Second Normal Form or 2NF, if it is in 1NF
and every non-key column is fully dependent on the entire primary key.
This rule applies when we have a primary key that consists of more than one column.
For example, let us consider the BooksIssued table with the following columns.
BookId, MemberId, BookTitle and IssueDate with 'BookId' and 'MemberId' forming the primary key of the table.
Now, notice the BookTitle column.
We can get the 'BookTitle' by looking up the 'BookId' in the 'Books' table.
In other words, 'BookTitle' is dependent on 'Book ID' only and not on 'Member ID'.
So, it is not dependent on the entire primary key.
To bring this table into Second Normal Form, we must remove 'BookTitle' from this table
and retain only those columns that are fully dependent on both the 'primary key' and columns.
IssueDate column will be retained here, as it is fully dependent on both the 'primary key' fields.
Now, let us see what the Third Normal Form is.
A table is said to be in Third Normal Form (3NF), if it is in 2NF
and if all the non-key columns are independent of each other.
For example, let us assume the BooksIssued table with columns as
BookIssueId (serving as the primary key), BookTitle, Member, IssueDate and ReturnDate.
And assume that the Library’s policy of return date is one month after the Book Issue Date.
Now, Base can calculate the Return Date by using the 'IssueDate' column which is a non-key column.
Meaning, 'ReturnDate' is really dependent only on 'IssueDate' column and no other column.
Also, if we enter a different date in the 'Return Date' field then it will violate our Library’s policy.
So, to keep the table in the 'Third Normal Form', we will remove the 'ReturnDate' column from the table.
So, now we know how to apply the first three Normal forms.
Usually, our database design can stop at 3NF.
For more information on Normal forms and database design, visit the websites shown on the screen.
Finally, let us test our database design, as we have gone over the database design process.
We can create the database structure.
Here we will create the Tables, Relationships, Rules or Constraints, Forms, Queries and Reports.
And we can test the database with real data and users.
Use the forms for performing data additions, updates or deletes to the database.
Run reports to see if the report results are correct and accurate.
As the database gets ready for use, we can check the performance in terms of speed.
We can add Indexes to the tables for faster retrieval of data.
And we should perform periodical database maintenance to keep our database application running successfully.
Now that we are done, here is an assignment for you:
Add a new entity called Media to the Library database design.
'Media' consists of DVDs and CDs and they can be either audio or video.
Just like books, DVDs and CDs can also be issued to the Library members.
Follow the database design process.
And apply the first three Normal forms to your design.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on the third part of Database Desin in LibreOffice Base.
To summarize, we learned the following topics on database design:
7. Refine the database design.
8. Apply the normalization rules.
9. Test the database design.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Java Servlets and JSPs.
Web server  Web container.
We will also learn to create a simple Java Servlet  and JSP.
HTML.
If not, for relevant tutorials please visit our website.
Before moving onto Servlets and JSP, let us first understand a web server.
A web server is a system that delivers content to end-users over the Internet.
It is also known as Internet server.
A web container is a component of the web server that interacts with Java servlets.
It is also known as servlet container.
The servlet container allows the servlets to execute inside it.
Now, let us learn how to write a simple servlet.
Switch to the Netbeans IDE.
Click on the Project tab on the left hand side of the IDE.
Earlier, we had created a simple Project named MyFirstProject.
You can see it here, on the left hand side of the IDE.
Let us now create a simple servlet inside this Project.
So, right-click on MyFirstProject.
Go to New and click on Servlet.
A New Servlet window opens.
Type the Class Name as MyServlet.
Type the Package name as org.spokentutorial.
Click on Add information to deployment descriptor (web.xml).
We can see that the Class Name is org.spokentutorial.MyServlet.
We can see that the Servlet Name is same as that of the Class Name which is MyServlet.
Note that the URL pattern is the same name as that of the Class Name. i.e MyServlet.
We can change it to MyServletPath.
The source code created by the IDE for MyServlet.java is seen in the Source Editor window.
We see MyServlet.java is created in the package org.spokentutorial.
Notice that the servlet is just like any other Java class
except that the servlet does not have a main method.
Now, let us learn something about Glassfish Server.
A servlet is deployed in a servlet container.
We are using Glassfish as our server.
Servlet container is a component of Glassfish that interacts with servlets.
Now, let us come back to Netbeans IDE.
Note that MyServlet extends the HttpServlet.
At the bottom of the code, we can see HttpServlet methods.
Click on the plus sign on the left to view these methods.
We see the methods - doGet, doPost and getServletInfo methods.
We can override these methods.
We can see that there is one more method named processRequest at the top.
We will delete processRequest and getServletInfo methods to avoid confusion.
So, we are left with two methods doGet and doPost.
For now, we will look at the doGet method.
doGet is the default method for any simple URLrequest.
So, we will type some code inside the doGet method.
We had already deleted processRequest method.
So, remove the method call for processRequest method.
Also remove it from the doPost method.
Now, let us come to the doGet method
We can see that there are two parameters that are passed to the doGet method.
One is the request and the other is the response object.
Also notice that request is of type HttpServletRequest.
And response object is of  type HttpServletResponse.
We will use the response object to send the HTML response back to the client side.
For that, we will have to create a PrintWriter object.
Notice that the PrintWriter class is already imported.
So, inside the doGet method type: PrintWriter space writer equal to response dot getWriter open and close brackets semicolon.
On the next line, type:
writer dot println within brackets and double quotes Welcome.
Then, press Ctrl S to save the file.
Now, let us run the servlet.
So, on the left hand side, in the Projects tab right click on MyServlet dot java.
Then, click on Run File.
We get a Set Servlet Execution URI dialog box.
Click on OK.
When the browser window opens, look at the URL.
It is localhost colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject slash MyServletPath.
Here, MyFirstProject is the context name and MyServletPath is the URL pattern that we had set.
We can see the text Welcome printed on the browser.
Now go back to the Netbeans IDE.
In the println method, we can pass html code.
For example, put Welcome in h3 tag.
Now, save the file.
Since we deployed this servlet earlier, we need not run it again.
The web container automatically detects it.
So, we can go back to the browser.
Refresh.We see the message Welcome in a different format.
Now, come back to the IDE.
Thus, we have successfully created a servlet.
We can create any web application using servlets.
We used the servlet to display an HTML code.
Notice that we have HTML code inside the Java code.
Even though this is possible, it is difficult to do for large web applications.
And hence not a recommended practice.
It would be better to replace this using JSP or Java Server Pages.
We will see the use of servlets and JSPs.
Servlets and JSPs are used together to separate presentation from content.
Servlets act as the controller and JSPs act as the view .
Servlets contain HTML code inside Java code.
JSPs contain Java code inside HTML code.
We will learn more about these in the coming tutorials.
We will now create a simple JSP page.
So, right click on MyFirstProject.
Go to New and click on JSP.
A New JSP window opens.
Type the Filename as welcome.
And then click on Finish.
Click on the Projects tab  on the left hand side.
We can see that Welcome.jsp is under Web Pages folder.
Now, in the editor, change Hello World to Welcome.
Notice that Welcome is within  "h1" tags.
Now, save the file.
Come back to the browser.
In the url, after MyFirstProject slash, type: welcome.jsp.
We see the output Welcome.
Therefore, for presentation purpose JSP is preferred.

If not for relevant tutorials please visit our website.
Here I am using
ChemCollective Vlabs version 2.1.0
Here I have opened a virtual chemistry lab application window.
Go to File->Load homework option.
Click on Temperature and solubility of salts option.
Click on problem description in the stockroom explorer.
Please pause the video here and read the problem description.
The problem has 3 sections.
In Second section: Observe whether dissolution of Potassium chloride and Cerium sulphate is exothermic or endothermic.
In the Third section: we have to explain the observations in section 1 and 2 based on a chemical principle.
Click on Workbench.
From the Stockroom explorer, Click on Potassium chloride, Cerius sulfate and Distilled water icons.
Click on glassware icon.
Again click on glassware icon.
We need two copies of 250 mL Erlenmeyer Flasks.
Use Duplicate option from the context menu to make the copies.
Click on select tools icon.
We need two copies of Weighing boats.
Use context menu and rename the Erlenmeyer Flasks as 1 and 2.
Now place each set of apparatus separately on the workbench.
Drag the Distilled water tank over to graduated cylinder.
In the Transfer amount input bar, type 50.
Transfer 50 mL of Distilled water to flask 1 using Precise Transfer.
Keep the graduated cylinder aside.
Drag the weighing boat 1 and place it on the scale.
Drag the Potassium chloride bottle over to weighing boat 1.
Type 5 in the transfer amount input bar. Click on Pour.
Keep Potassium chloride bottle aside.
Drag the weighing boat 1 and place it on  Flask 1.
In the transfer amount input bar,  Type 5.
Keep the weighing boat aside.
In the Solution Info Panel, click on Solid radio button.
Observe, Species and grams columns.
Since all the potassium chloride is soluble in water, there is no solid Potassium chloride in the flask.
This indicates that potassium chloride is readily soluble in water.
Let us keep on adding Potassium chloride to flask 1 until undissolved Potassium chloride remains in flask 1.
Place the weighing boat 1 back on the Scale. Click on TARE.
Drag and place Potassium chloride bottle over  weighing boat 1
Type 15 in the transfer amount input bar. Click on pour.
Keep Potassium chloride bottle aside.
Change the Transfer Bar to Realistic Transfer using Tools menu.
Drag and place weighing boat 1 over flask 1.
Observe the Solution info panel.
Observe grams column, approximately 2 grams of Potassium chloride remains undissolved.
Let us now check if increase in temperature increases or decreases the solubility.
Click on Select tool icon, choose Bunsen Burner.
Bring the Bunsen Burner close to flask 1.
Place flask 1 over Bunsen Burner.
The flask gets heated quickly and undissolved potassium chloride dissolves completely.
Observe the temperature, as temperature increases potassium chloride dissolves.
At approximately 40
We can turn off the flame of the Bunsen Burner when not required.
Click on the Burner. Two black arrows pointing up and down appear.
Now I will demonstrate the solubility of Cerium(III) Sulphate.
Note that solubility of Cerium(III) Sulphate is much lower than potassium chloride.
Transfer 50 mL of Distilled water to graduated cylinder  using Precise transfer.
Now transfer 50 mL of Distilled water to flask 2 using Precise transfer.
Drag  Weighing boat 2 and place it on the Scale.
We will begin by dissolving just 1 gram of  Cerium(III) Sulphate.
Transfer 1 gram of Cerium(III) Sulphate to Weighing boat 2.
Keep Cerium(III) Sulphate bottle aside.
Transfer 1 gram of Cerium(III) Sulphate from Weighing boat 2 to Flask 2.
In the Solution Info panel, observe Species and grams columns.
Since all the Cerium(III) Sulphate is soluble in water, it indicates zero grams.
Let us add more Cerium(III) Sulphate to flask 2 to check the solubility.
Place the Weighing boat 2 back on the Scale. Press TARE.
Change the transfer bar to Realistic Transfer.
Drag and place Weighing boat 2 over flask 2.
Observe the Solution info panel.
Observe grams column, approximately 3 grams of Cerium(III) Sulphate remains undissolved.
Let us now check if increase in temperature increases or decreases the solubility.
Bring the Bunsen Burner close to flask 2.
Click on the up pointing arrow to turn-on the burner.
Observe that  grams column shows increase in value.
Turn-off the Burner.
For potassium chloride, solubility increases with increase in temperature.
For Cerium(III)Sulphate, solubility decreases with increase in temperature.
Click on Problem description window.
Click on Workbench.
Let us delete Erlenmeyer Flasks from the workbench.
Click on the flask and press Delete on the keyboard.
Click on glassware icon.
We need two copies of Foam Cups.
Rename Foam Cups as 1 and 2.
Change the Transfer Bar to Precise Transfer.
Transfer 50 mL of Distilled water to graduated cylinder  using Precise transfer.
Place Foam cups  at a convenient location on the workbench.
Transfer 50 mL of Distilled water to Foam cup 1 using Precise transfer.
Click on Foam cup 1.
Foam cups act as Calorimeter for measurements made at constant pressure.
Heat exchange does not happen easily as it is a better insulator than glass.
Place the weighing boat 1 on the Scale. Press TARE.
Weigh 5 grams of potassium chloride.
Keep potassium chloride bottle aside.
Bring weighing boat 1 over to Foam cup 1.
Again click on Foam cup 1.
Dissolution of potassium chloride in water absorbs heat, hence temperature decreases.
It is an endothermic process.
Now let us repeat the same procedure for Cerium(III) Sulphate.
Fill the graduated cylinder with  50 mL Distilled water.
Transfer 50 mL of water from graduated cylinder to Foam cup 2.
Click on Foam cup 2.
Place weighing boat 2 on the Scale. Press TARE.
Weigh 2 grams of  Cerium(III) Sulphate.
Drag Weighing boat 2 over to Foam cup 2.
Type 2 in the transfer amount input bar.
Keep the Weighing boat aside.
Again Click on Foam cup 2.
Dissolution of Cerium(III) Sulphate in water releases heat, hence temperature increases.
Let us now analyse the results.
For an exothermic process, solubility decreases as temperature increases.
Observed that solubility of, potassium chloride is Endothermic and
Explain why heat is absorbed or evolved during a reaction.
Determine whether dissolution of Sodium Chloride is exothermic or endothermic.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Java Interfaces.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Creating an interface
Creating  Implementation classes and  Usage of  Interface.
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE.
You should also have the knowledge of subclassing and Abstract classes in Java.
First let's understand what is an interface.
An Interface contains a set of abstract methods and static data members.
It defines the signatures of a set of methods without the body.
It is declared using the interface keyword.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called InterfaceDemo.
Here, we will create the necessary classes and interface to demonstrate the usage of interfaces.
Right-click on src folder and click New > Interface.
Type the name as Animal and press Enter.
Note that the “interface” keyword is used for defining an interface.
Now type the code as displayed on the screen.
Here, the interface name is Animal.
It contains three abstract methods talk(), see() and move().
All such methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
An interface can also contain constant variable declarations.
Here, the constant string value “Mammal” is assigned to the variable “type1”.
And “Reptiles” is assigned to the variable “type2”.
All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static and final.
Next we will see implementation class for an interface with an example.
Here, Human is a class which implements the Animal interface.
So, it must provide implementations for the methods talk(), see() and move().
A class can also implement multiple interfaces.
As shown in the example, the class Human implements two interfaces Animal and Action.
Note that a comma operator used in the syntax is to identify the different  interfaces.
Now this class should provide implementations to all the abstract methods in both Animal and Action interfaces.
The figure here represents an implement relation.
The Animal class is an interface.
The Human and Snake classes are the two implementation classes.
The Human class provides its own different implementations for talk(), see() and move() methods.
And, the Snake class provides its own different implementations for talk(), see() and move() methods.
Let us understand the usage of interfaces with a sample program.
Right-click on the default package and create a class called Human.
Now, to make this an implementation class of Animal, type: implements Animal.
Now, we can see an error comes up in the Eclipse IDE.
This error indicates that we should provide an implementation to the Animal interface.
Let us see how to rectify this error.
Now let us define the methods talk(), see() and move().
So, type: public void talk( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes "I am a human and I belong to".
Now we can use the value of the static, final variable type1 declared in the Animal interface.
So, type: + Animal.type1+ within quotes "family" semicolon.
Let us now implement the see() method.
So, type: public void see( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes "I can see all colors" semicolon.
We should also define the move() method.
So, type: public void move( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes "I move by walking" semicolon.
Note that the error disappears, once all the methods are implemented.
Next we will see how to define the Snake class.
I have already created it in my project.
Please create the snake class in your project and type the following code as displayed on the screen.
Now let us go through the code.
We can see that all the methods of the Animal interface- talk(), see() and move() are implemented inside this class.
Here, the talk() method prints “I am a snake and I belong to”.
Then the value of Animal.type2 is to be printed and then “family”.
Here, the see() method prints “I can see only in black and white”.
The move() method prints "I move by crawling".
Note that the Human class has its own implementations of talk(), see() and move() methods.
And, the Snake class has its own implementations of talk(), see() and move() methods.
Now, right-click on the default package, click new >  class and then type the name as Demo.
Inside this class, we will have the main method.
So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method.
In this line, we instantiate the  Human class using the Animal interface.
This is represented as Animal h equals new Human();
Now we can invoke the different methods using this object as h.talk(); h.see();   h.move();
Next, we instantiate the Snake class using the Animal interface.
Now we can invoke the different methods using this object as shown.
Now, let us run this Demo program.
So, right-click on the class  Demo and then select Run as > Java Application.
We can see the output.
These are printed by the talk(), see() and move() methods invoked using the human class object h.
These are printed by the talk(), see() and move() methods invoked using  the Snake class object s.
Now, let us explore the differences between an interface and an abstract class.
All the methods in an interface should be abstract.
Within interface, there should not be any  constructors,
concrete methods,  static methods and main method.
But an abstract class can have all these inside it.
The variables in an interface should be static and final.
There are no such restrictions for an abstract class.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about: * Creating an Interface
* Creating an implementation class and
* Usage of interfaces.
As an assignment, create an interface Vehicle which contains the methods brake() and run().
Create another interface Fuel which contains the following methods.   fill(String type,int quantity), pay(int quantity,int price).
Create a subclass Car which implements both interfaces Vehicle and Fuel.
Here, brake method should print "Car Applies Power brake".
And the run method must print "Car is running on 4 wheels".
Similarly fill() method can print the type and quantity of the fuel filled.
For example: 10 Litres of petrol.
pay() method can be used to print price to be paid. For example: Pay Rs. 640
Create another subclass Bike which again implements both the interfaces Vehicle and Fuel.
Here, brake method can print "Bike Applies hand brake".
And the run method can print “Bike is running on 2 wheels”.
Next, implement the fill() and pay() methods as explained earlier.
Finally create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results.

In this tutorial, we will learn the following:
Inserting tables in Writer.
Inserting hyperlinks in Writer.
We will start by learning how to insert an image file in LibreOffice Writer.
Let us open our 'resume.odt' file.
In order to insert an image into the document, first click inside the resume.odt document.
Now click on the Insert option in the menu bar, then click on Picture and finally click on From File option.
You see that an Insert picture dialog-box appears.
Now you can select a picture if you have saved it on your system by writing the name of the file in the Location field.
Since we have not saved any, we will insert a picture from among the options which are provided by default.
So, click on the Pictures option on the left hand side of the dialog-box.
Now, click on one of the images and finally click on the Open button.
You see that the image gets inserted into your document.
You can resize this image and drag it to the top right corner of the resume.
So, click on the image first. You see that colored handles appear on the image.
Place the cursor on one of the handles and press the left mouse button.
Resize the image by dragging the cursor. After the resizing is done, click on the image and drag it to the top right corner of the editor.
Other popular methods of inserting images are by using clipboard or scanner and from the gallery.
Next we will learn how to insert tables in Writer.
Tables in 'LibreOffice writer' enable users to store their information in a tabular form.
To insert a table into your document, you can either click on the Table icon in the toolbar and select the size of the table or you can do so through the Insert option in the menu bar.
So, in order to insert a table below the heading "Education Details", place the cursor below this heading.
Now, click on the Insert menu in the menu bar and then click on the Table option.
It opens up a dialog-box with several fields.
In the Name field, let us give the name of the table as "resume table".
Under the heading Size, let us keep the number of Columns as 2.
Click on the upward-arrow in the Rows field and increase the number of Rows to 4.
Hence you can increase or decrease the size of the  table using the up and the down arrows in the columns and rows fields.
Now, click on the AutoFormat button in the dialog-box.
This opens a new dialog-box where you can select the format of the table you want to insert.
Writer provides several options to choose from. We click on the Noneoption under Format and then click on the OK button.
Again click on the OK button.
You see that the table with two columns and four rows gets inserted below the heading.
Now we can write any information in tabular form inside the table.
For example, click inside the cell in the first row and first column of the table.
We type here "Secondary School Examination".
Now, click on the adjacent cell and write 93 percent. So, this shows that Ramesh scored 93 percent in the secondary school examination.
Likewise, we can type further educational details in the table.
Click on the cell just below the cell where we typed "Secondary School Examination".
We write here "Higher Secondary School Examination" and in the adjacent cell, we write the score as "88" percent.
Click on the first cell in the third row to access the next cell. Alternately, you may press the Tab key to move from cell-to- cell.
So, let's press Tab and type "Graduation". Type the score as "75%" in the adjacent cell.
Finally, in the last row, we type the heading as "Post Graduation" in the first cell and in the adjacent cell, the score as "70" percent.
So, we see that the table with education details is represented in the resume.
Let us place the cursor in the last cell of the table.
Now, if we want to add an additional row just below the last row of the table, press the Tab key on the keyboard.
You see that a new row gets inserted.
On the left hand side of the table, we type "Phd" as the degree attained and on the right hand side we type “65%” as the marks obtained.
So,we see that the Tab key is very useful in order to add new rows one below the other when the cursor is placed in the last cell.
Using Tab and Shift+Tab, one can also navigate from cell-to-cell within the table.
Another important feature in Tables is, the Optimal Column Width option which automatically adjusts the column widths according to the contents of the cells.
In order to apply this feature in the second or the right hand side column of the table, first click and place the cursor anywhere in the second column.
So, let us place the cursor after the text '65%' in the last cell.
Now, click on the Table menu in the menu bar and then go to the Autofit option.
In the menu which appears on the screen, click on the 'Optimal Column Width' option.
You see that the column width adjusts itself automatically, matching the content of the cells in the column.
Similarly, we can do this for any of the columns in a table.
You can set different kinds of borders for your table - from having no borders at all to having all inner and outer borders or only outer borders in your table etc.
For this, select Table tab in the main menu and Table Properties option, Borders tab to select appropriate option.
Next we will see how hyperlinks are created in Writer.
A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.
A hyperlink is a reference to a document that the reader can directly follow or that is followed automatically.
A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.
Before creating a hyperlink in the file, we first create a document to be hyperlinked.
So, click on the New icon in the toolbar.
A new text document opens. Now we create a table for hobbies in this new document.
So, we write the heading as "HOBBIES".
Now, let us write few of the hobbies as "Listening to music", "Playing table tennis" and "Painting", one below the other.
Let us save this file.
Click on the Save icon in the toolbar. In the Name field, let us type the file name as "HOBBY".
Click on the down-arrow in the Save in folder and click on the Desktop option. Now, click on the Save button.
So, the file gets saved on the desktop.
We close this file now. Let us now create a hyperlink in the file 'resume.odt' which would open this document.
Now we write the heading as "HOBBIES", below the table containing educational details.
In order to make the text "HOBBIES" as a hyperlink, first select the text by dragging the cursor along the heading- "HOBBIES".
Now, click on the Insert menu in the menu bar and then click on the Hyperlink option.
A dialog-box opens which has options like Internet, Mails and news, Document and New Document.
Since we are creating a hyperlink for a text document, we click on the Document option.
Now click on the Open file button in the Path field .
Let us now click on the Desktop option in the dialog-box to access the new document which we had created.
Now, click on the 'hobby.odt' option and then click on the Open button.
You see that the path to the file gets inserted in the Path field.
Click on the Apply field and then click on the Close button.
You see that the text "HOBBIES" is underlined and is blue in color. Hence the text is now a hyperlink.
Now, place the cursor on the heading HOBBIES and press the Control key and the left mouse-button together.
You see that the file containing the hobbies opens up.
Similarly you can also create hyperlinks for images as well as websites.
Inserting table in Writer.
Inserting hyperlinks in Writer.
Open practice.odt.
Insert an image into the file.
Insert a table with 3 rows and 2 columns.
Make a hyperlink to open www.google.com website when you click on the image in the file.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Managing Content.
Now we will learn how to create new content.
We will add our first Event. Click on Content.
Click on Add content and choose Events.
We will set up a sample Event to demonstrate some things that we have set up.
I will type: “DrupalCamp Cincinnati” in the Event Name field.
In the Event Description field, type: “This is the first DrupalCamp in the southern Ohio region”.
Note that the Create New revision check-box is turned ON here.
We don’t have to do anything over here on the right hand side.
Leave the Event Logo as blank, for now.
But we do want an Event Website.
So, we’ll type the URL as "
In the Link text, we will leave this blank. The display would just be the actual URL; so, we will do that for now.
When we click on the Event Date, a little calendar pops up.
Let’s select January 11th  2016.
Now, we can’t add any EVENT SPONSORS yet because we don’t have any User Groups set up.
Another important Drupal feature is Inline Entity Reference.
It allows you to add user groups on the fly. But we will learn about this later.
We have some EVENT TOPICS. Let us type ‘I’ and select ‘Introduction to Drupal’.
Click on Add another item. This time we will type ‘m'.
Notice that all topics that have an ‘m’ in it, will show up.
So, let’s select Module Development. You can choose other topics if you want.
Then click Save and publish.
Here is our DrupalCamp Cincinnati node.
The Title, the Body.. the Event Website which is automatically a link but it doesn’t really exist.
We can change this Event Date format, if we want.
This is a taxonomy.
If this link is clicked, every single Event tagged to Introduction to Drupal would be available and will be listed in publication date order.
We have just created our very first event node successfully.
Now, let’s click on Shortcuts and Add content and this time let’s add our User Group.
We will call this as "Cincinnati User Group".
In the User Group Description field, type: “This is the user group from the southern Ohio region based in Cincinnati”.
“We meet on the 3rd Thursday of every month”.
We can also add more information there.
The URL for this User Group is: https colon slash slash groups dot drupal dot org slash Cincinnati.
It’s non-existent as of now.  But, this is how it would usually appear.
To find a User Group in your area, come to groups dot drupal dot org.
Then do a quick search based on what you might be interested in.
There are many User Groups around the world.
In Group Contact, let’s type: Drupal space Group and in the Contact Email, type: "drupalgroup@email.com".
Note that this should be a properly formatted email address. Otherwise, Drupal will reject it.
Choose Group Level from the multiple options here.
And, in the EVENTS SPONSORED, we have to choose an Event.
If you just type 'd', "Drupal Camp Cincinnati" will appear in the drop-down.
Click Save and Publish.
We have successfully created our first User Group.
Now we will learn about managing our content.
If we click on Content, we will get a list of all the content on our site.
It doesn’t matter what Content type it is, we can see all the content.
We can filter by Publish status, Content type and by Title.
If we type ‘W’ here and click Filter, we’ll only get the nodes which begin with ‘w’.
Click on Reset.
If we have multiple languages, we can choose another language as well.
And, once we’ve got our list, we can select more than one node at a time and do some things Like- Delete, make it Sticky, Promote it, Publish it etc.
So, I’ll select Unpublish content and click on Apply.
Notice that the status of my selected nodes has been updated to Unpublished.
This is the easiest place to manage content.
Let’s select all the nodes at once. Click on Publish and then on Apply.
It doesn’t matter if some are already published. Now all the content is published.
We can also Edit or Delete a single node here or select a batch of nodes and delete the content.
Managing content in Drupal is quite simple. Just click on the Content link in the toolbar and it brings you to this page.
Using the tabs at the top, we can manage the Comments that have been made.
And also the Files that have been uploaded in any file field.
To view the image, click on it and it will open on the screen.
To see where the image is used, click on the Places link. It gives us a list of nodes where the file is used.
We can manage our Content, Comments and Files from the Content link in the Administration toolbar.
Now, let’s add a comment to one of our nodes.
I’m going to add a comment – “Great Node!" "Fantastic content.”.
Click Save.
Since we’re logged in as the superuser, everything is already approved for us. We don’t actually have to do anything.
If you set up comments for approval, then you can click Content, Comments and you’ll be able to manage them here.
For example - bulk publish comments or delete them from this screen.
Managing Content, Comments and Files is all done from one place, in Drupal.
Next, let us update a node or make a change to a node and see how Revisions works.
Click on Home link to come to the Home page.
Click on Quick edit on DrupalCamp Cincinnati.
Let’s add some more content to the body of this node – “There is another great camp in Columbus every October.”
Click Save.
And now, click on DrupalCamp Cincinnati and you’ll see a new tab called Revisions.
Click on Revisions and you will see that admin has updated this node at 2:37 and it’s the Current revision.
The old version is also available.
On clicking it, we can look at the old version which doesn’t have the second paragraph.
To go back, click on Revisions. Then we can either Revert or Delete that old version.
There are other Modules that make this a little easier.
But Drupal has complete version control ,built in. So, you know who, and when changes were made to any given node and you can revert back whenever you want.
So, version control in Drupal is built in and is really helpful.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer- Creating Newsletters with Multiple Columns.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create newsletters in LibreOffice Writer and a few operations that can be performed on them.
Here we are using GNU/Linux  as our operating system and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
A newsletter is used as a publication which gets circulated out to its subscribers in a regular time interval. For example - a periodical, a pamphlet and many more.
It has multiple columns as sections and makes it easier for the reader to go through different articles in these sections.
Using LibreOffice Writer, one can create newsletters which make reading of articles much easier and faster.
Let's open a new text document by clicking on File >> New and Text Document option.
Save this document with filename Newsletter.
So, we have a new text document named  Newsletter.
Now, let's insert columns into our document.
To do so, first click on the Format button in the menu bar and then click on Columns.
A dialog-box appears with various options -
selecting the number of columns you want
setting the width and spacing of these columns
as well as * setting the various properties of the separator lines.
We will select two columns for the newsletter document by increasing the Columns field value to 2.
The five icons besides the Columns field show you the preview of the various formats available.
So, let's click on the second format.
Let's keep all the other values which define the property of the columns as default
You see that 2 columns get displayed in the text area.
Let us write an article in our first column.
We will give its heading as Nature in bold text with font size 15.
And below that, we will write an article on it.
You see that the cursor automatically goes to the next column after it reaches the end of the first column.
You can even insert a picture in the column and resize it so that it fits into the column.
Now, after leaving out some spaces you can write another article into the column.
So, we will first give it a heading as Sports in bold text with font size 15 and below that we will write an article on it.
So, you see, columns make it easier for the reader to go through multiple articles.
Let us delete some sentences so that our article fits in the first column only.
Then, to access the further columns click on the Insert button and then click on Manual Break.
In the dialog-box which appears, click on the Column break button and then click on the OK button.
You see that the cursor comes on the next column automatically.
So, you can start writing another article in this column.
All the formatting options like -
Align left, Align right, adding Background Color to the text,
Highlighting the text and many other features
can be added to the text to make it attractive.
For example, we select the portion of the text to which we want to apply a background color.
Now, click on the Background Color icon in the toolbar and then click on Green 4.
We see that the background color of the selected text changes to light green.
Like wise you can give different background colors to different parts of the text.
You can even add banners to the newsletter by first clicking on the Text option in the drawing toolbar.
Now, place the text-box anywhere in the document where there is no written text.
Inside the text-box, you can write any text which will act as a banner or ads.
So, let us type some text, like "This is a newsletter".
You can even add effects to this text.
For example, first right-click on the text and then click on the Text option in the menu.
A dialog-box appears which has tabs namely Text and Text Animation.
Click on the Text Animation tab.
In the Effect field, under this tab, there are various options.
In order to blink the text in the newsletter, we click on the Blink option
and finally click on the OK button.
We see that the text "This is a newsletter" constantly blinks in the document.
Similarly, various such effects and graphics can be given to the text.
Now, for writing a new article on the next page, you need to first click on the Insert button
and then click on the Manual Break option.
In the dialog-box which appears, click on the Page break button
and finally click on the OK button.
You see that the cursor comes on the next page.
This page contains the same column format as on the previous page.
For maintaining a word count in your article, first  select a portion of your text or the entire document.
Now, click on the Tools option in the menu bar.
Now, click on the Word Count option in the drop-down box.
A dialog-box appears which shows you the word count of current selection and the whole document as well.
It also shows the total count of characters in your entire document as well as in the selected text.
The spell check can be done automatically while writing the document.
Click on the AutoSpellcheck icon in the toolbar.
Now, while writing the article if there are any spelling mistakes then Writer automatically shows them by underlining the word with a red line.
For example, when we write the word  Cat as C -A- A -T and press the space-bar, we see that a red line is displayed below it.
But when we correct the word, the red line disappears.
Hence, we see that all the formatting options discussed in the previous tutorials can be applied in the newsletters too.
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer.
To summarize, we learned about how to create Newsletters in LibreOffice Writer and few operations which can be performed on them.

Hello and welcome to this tutorial on “How to use recordMyDesktop”.
recordMyDesktop is a free and open source screencasting software that works on the Ubuntu Linux operating system.
For more information on Screencasting software, please watch the spoken tutorial on "How To Use Camstudio" available on this website.
I have already downloaded gtk-recordMyDesktop version 0.3.8 and installed it on my PC through the Synaptic Package Manager.
For more information on how to install software in Ubuntu Linux, please refer to the spoken tutorials on Ubuntu Linux available on this website.
Once you have successfully installed  recordMyDesktop, go to the Ubuntu main menu on the top of the monitor or screen.
Click on Applications and choose Sound & Video.
This will open the context menu in which you will find gtk-recordMyDesktop.  Click on it.
This will open the  'gtk-recordMyDesktop' application window.
The main application window serves the purpose of defining some basic parameters of the recording while the tray icon is primarily used for run time control of your recordings.
Notice a new entry in your system tray, an icon - 'the red circle', representing the record button.
The system tray icon has 3 states: Recording, Stop, Pause.
When 'recordMyDesktop' is launched, the icon will be a 'Record' sign i.e. the red circle.
When one starts recording, the icon will change into a square which is the Stop sign.
Observe, there are 2 squares here.
This is because I am using 'recordMyDesktop' to record this tutorial.
To pause the recording, one has to right-click on the square and the icon will change into a pause sign - two thin, parallel and vertical rectangles.
To resume the recording, one has to click on the pause sign again.
In order to stop the recording, one has to click on the square.
Before setting any parameters, let me give you an important information.
Right-click on the red circle i.e. 'system tray' icon.  Here, you have the options to show or hide the main application window.
When you start a recording session, the main window will hide itself by default.
One can also choose to show the main application window by selecting this option.
“Select Area on Screen” is a way of defining the area that you wish to record.
Choosing this option will change the cursor into a cross-pen with which one can draw the capture on the screen.
“Quit” option exits 'recordMyDesktop', exactly like the button on the main window.
Coming back to the application window, you will find the display panel to the left with a small 'preview' window.
It depicts a scaled version of your desktop which can be used for defining an area of recording.
To the right of this panel, you will find the options to increase or decrease the Video Quality and the Sound Quality.
By default, both Video and Sound quality are set at 100.  This setting gives very good playback video quality as well as audio quality.
The trade-off, however, is a larger file size.  For creating Spoken Tutorials, one does not need to have 100% Video quality as it increases the file size.
Experimenting a bit with these parameters will allow you to get an optimum file size with reasonably good video and sound quality.
I will set the video quality to 50 and sound quality to 100.
This is because the size of the audio stream will occupy only a small part of your resulting file.
By default, 'recordMyDesktop' does not record audio. To enable audio capture, one has to check the box to the left of Sound Quality.
Notice the button ADVANCED.  Let's click on it. This will open another dialog-box as seen here.
Visit the ADVANCED window at least once, in order to better customize the behavior of  'recordMyDesktop'.
All options in this window are saved and applied when you close it. There are 4 options in the Main Menu of this window.
The first tab is Files. There are two options here.
There is an option to overwrite existing files, bearing the same filename in the same location, with the one you chose for your recording.
By default, this option is turned off.  Hence, the existing files are not touched at all. Instead, the new one is saved with a number postfixed at its filename.
So, if you choose to save your recording as 'recording.ogv' in your home directory and there is already a file named like that,
the new one will instead get saved as 'recording-1.ogv'. If 'recording-1.ogv' exists then the new file will be named as 'recording-2.ogv' and so on.
Let me open the Advanced tab again . If the “Overwrite Existing Files” option is turned on, existing files are deleted without any prompt.
So, one has to be careful with it.   The “Working Directory” option is the location in which the temporary files are stored during the recording.
This applies only when you are not performing encoding on the fly.
The next tab is Performance.  There are 5 options here.  Be sure to set the “Frames per second”.
2 frames per second is a good setting for this parameter. However, for high animation videos, set any number between 15-20 frames per second.
The “Encode On the Fly” option causes 'recordMyDesktop' to encode during the capture.
By default, it is off.  This is useful when you don't need a high fps or you are capturing a small area.
But, if you need a smooth recording of a not-so-small area, you should turn this option off.
As mentioned earlier, when using this option both audio and video quality must be set to 100%.
“Zero Compression” tab controls the compression of the cache. “Quick Subsampling” deals with the quality of the colorspace transformation.  We will leave them as they are.
“Full shots at every frame” enables full captures.  By default, it is turned off.
The third tab is Sound. The “Channels” option sets the number of channels in the resulting audio stream.
It can be 1(mono) or 2(stereo). When recording from a microphone, selecting more than one channels is completely unnecessary and will only increase the size of your output file.
The “Frequency”  setting is probably the most defining factor for the audio quality of a recording.
The default is 22050 which is more than enough for speech but if you are recording music, you might need to use 44100.
The “Device” should be set to “plughw:0,0”. This is so, that you have precise control of the channels and frequency values.
Only then will the audio play smoothly, without any hitches or jumps.  Typing “default” in lowercase alphabets also works.
If you are using an external jack for recording then check this box.
The Channels, Frequency and Device fields will be disabled.  These settings are now provided by the Jack server.
Before enabling Jack capture, you should make sure that a Jack server is running.
The last tab is  Miscellaneous. There are various options here which are meant to be used less frequently.
An important option here is the Follow Mouse option.  When checked, the capture area will follow the cursor wherever it moves on the screen.
When unchecked, the capture area remains stationary in spite of cursor movement. I will give you a demo of this soon.
Let me also check Outline Capture Area On Screen.
We will close this window now.  Remember, all the settings will be saved as soon as we close this window.
In the preview window of the display panel, let's draw a capture area for our sample recording.
Click on the left-mouse-button, drag. Release the button.
You will find a small rectangle in the preview window and a larger rectangle on your screen.  This is the actual capture area.
All activities within this rectangle will be captured in the demo recording.  Now, let's do a demo recording.
I will click on the Record icon. "Hello and welcome to the demo recording using 'recordMyDesktop'".
"This is a demo recording to demonstrate how easy it is to create a spoken tutorial".
"Click on 'Applications' – Choose 'office > Wordprocessor'. Let me type 'Demo' here and click on the square icon to stop the recording".
'recordMyDesktop' is now encoding and producing a movie in 'ogv' format.
Let me close the open office writer. The encoding is complete and the movie is now ready.  Let's check it out.
We will find the output 'ogv' file in the Home folder.  Click on home folder, here it is. This is our demo recording. Let's play this.
So, I hope the information given in this tutorial will help you to use 'recordMyDesktop' on your computer.
Install this free and open source software and use it to create audio-video tutorials and online visual learning modules of your own.
Spoken tutorial activity is the initiative of the ‘Talk to a Teacher’ project coordinated by:

This brings us to the end of this tutorial. This is Nancy from IIT Bombay, saying Goodbye and thank you for watching.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Branching in Git.
To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of running Linux commands on Terminal.
Let us learn about branching.
Typically, branches are used in a project to develop new modules or to fix a bug.
It helps to work with new modules of a project without disturbing the main project.
The default branch of the Git is master.
We use different branches to develop new modules
and it would be merged with the master branch later.
For example, this diagram visualizes a repository with master and new-module branches.
There are some commits named C1, C2 and C3 in the master branch.
Then a branch 'new-module' is created in C3 commit.
C4, C5 and C8 are the commits of new-module branch.
At the same time, the commits C6 and C7 have been made in the master branch.
Here, you can see that new-module branch is not disturbing the master branch.
Once the new-module is ready, we will merge it back with the master branch.
In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how branch works. Merging will be covered in the next tutorial.
We will open our Git repository mywebpage which we created earlier.
I will continue to use html files for demonstration. You may use any file type of your choice.
Let us check the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
First, we will check whether we have any branch in the repository.
Type: git space branch and press Enter.
It shows the default branch 'master', as mentioned earlier.
Now say, I want to create a branch named "new-chapter".
Type: git space branch space new-chapter and press Enter.
Let us see the branch list by typing git space branch and press Enter.
Here, we can see the branch "new-chapter" in the list.
We can also see an asterisk symbol with the master branch.
It indicates that currently we are working in the master branch.
To go into the "new-chapter" branch, type: git space checkout space new-chapter and press Enter.
To check the branch name, type: git space branch and press Enter.
By seeing the asterisk, we can understand that now we are in the "new-chapter" branch.
Next, I will create a html file story.html and commit it for demonstration purpose.
Type: gedit space story.html space ampersand and press Enter.
I will copy and paste some code into this file, from my Writer document, which I had saved earlier.
Remember, we have to commit our work whenever we add or remove any file.
To add the file to the staging area, type: git space add space story.html and press Enter.
To commit our work, type: git space commit space hyphen m space within double quotes “Added story.html in new-chapter branch” and press Enter.
Let’s check the Git log of "new-chapter" branch by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
Here, we can see our latest commit “Added story.html in new-chapter branch”.
Now, let’s say, we want to go back to our master branch to do some work.
So, we’ll type: git space checkout space master and press Enter.
To check the Git log, type: git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
Here, we can't see the commit “Added story.html in new-chapter branch”.
This is because, that commit belongs to "new-chapter" branch only.
Let’s check the folder content by typing ls and press Enter.
Here, we can't see the file story.html also.
Next, we shall make some changes in the file history.html.
Let's open the file by typing gedit space history.html space ampersand and press Enter.
Let’s add some lines.
Let’s commit our work at this point by typing git space commit space hyphen am space within double quotes “Added chapter two in history.html” and press Enter.
Till now, we have been working with the master branch.
Now, let us check if this commit is reflected in new-chapter branch.
To go into new-chapter branch, type: git space checkout space new-chapter and press Enter.
Let’s check the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
Here, we can't see the commit “Added chapter two in history.html” as that is in the master branch.
Let’s add some lines in our file story.html. Type: gedit space story.html space ampersand and press Enter.
I will add some lines from my Writer document.
To check the Git status, type: git space status and press Enter.
Note that we have not committed our work at this stage.
What do you think will happen if we try to switch branch without committing? This should lead to an error.
Let us try to go back to the master branch. Type: git space checkout space master and press Enter.
This error shows that we can't switch back to other branches without committing the changes.
But, what if I don't want to commit the changes, as they are not important at this stage? This can be done using stashing.
We will learn about stashing in the upcoming tutorials.
For now, we will forcefully exit this branch by using the hyphen hyphen force flag.
Type: git space checkout space hyphen hyphen force space master and press Enter.
Once again, we will go back to new-chapter branch, to check whether the changes are discarded or not.
Type: git space checkout space new-chapter and press Enter.
Let’s open the file story.html by typing gedit space story.html space ampersand and press Enter.
Here we can see that our changes have been discarded.Let us close the gedit.
In the next tutorial, we will learn to merge this new-chapter branch with the master branch.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about: Branching, Creating a branch and
As an assignment-  Create a branch named "chapter-two".
Go into the chapter-two branch.
Do some commits.
Switch back to the master branch.
Check the Git log and  understand that, in the master branch, you can't see the commits of the "branch chapter-two".

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Third party Plugins in gedit Text editor.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to  install third party plugins and use it.
Now we will learn about third party plugins.
Plugins are also developed by other programmers.
These are called third party plugins.
This gives you extra functionality that is not available in default gedit plugins.
Installing a third-party plugin involves:
* Placing the plugin files in the correct directory
* Activating the plugin.
Let us go to the gedit website to download the plugins.
Click on the plugins link at the top right corner.
Click on Lists of gedit plugins.
We can see many links for third-party plugins for different versions of gedit Text editor.
Since my version of gedit is 3.10, I'll click on the link for version 3.8 and 3.10.
You have to choose the link depending upon your gedit version.
Scroll down to see the various third party plugins.
Let us explore the features of Intelligent Text completion.
* Auto-close brackets and quotes
Auto-complete html tags
Auto-indent after function or list.
I'll demonstrate how to install and use Intelligent Text Completion.
Let us go to the gedit website.
We can see the Features and Installation details for Intelligent Text Completion.
Go through the information thoroughly for your own understanding.
Click on the Clone or download drop-down box on the top right corner.
Then click on the Download Zip.
Select the Save file option and click Ok.
The file is saved in the Downloads folder.
Extract the files. Open the folder to see the available files.
I'll copy the folder gedit3-8, because my gedit version is higher than this.
We need to copy this folder to dot local/share/gedit/plugins in the Home directory.
Select the Home directory.
Click on the View menu on the Menu bar and select Show Hidden Files.
Locate the '.local' folder 'share'.
Create the subdirectory gedit, if it is not there.
Inside gedit directory, let us create another subdirectory called plugins.
Paste the folder or copy the files from the folder inside plugins.
Third party plugin files should be copied to the correct directory as shown.
Now, our plugin is ready to use.
Let's open the gedit Text editor.
Under the Plugins tab, scroll down to see whether our third party plugin is added.
We can see the Intelligent Text completion plugin is added to our list.
Check the box. Click Close.
Let us see how the Intelligent Text completion helps us to write a html program.
I'll type tags as shown here.
After the less than symbol, press backslash.
It will automatically insert the title closing tag.
In the next line, type less than backslash. You can see the head closing tag is inserted.
Again type less than backslash. html closing tag is also inserted.
So, it automatically detects the html tags and creates them.
It makes our work easy while writing the source code.
We can see, the syntax highlight is in off mode.
Until you save a document in gedit Text editor, syntax highlighting is turned off.
You can turn it ON by clicking the menu View and Highlight Mode.
You can select the mode depending upon your source code.
As our program is HTML, I'll select HTML option from the list.
We can see, our HTML code gets highlighted with the syntax.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarise.
In this tutorial, we learnt about how to install third party plugins and use it.
Here is an assignment for you. Download and Install a plugin called Advanced find/replace plugin for gedit Text editor.
Enable it and check its functions.
This is Nirmala Venkat from IIT Bombay, signing off. Thanks for watching.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Control flow and Event handling.
To record this tutorial, I am using : OpenModelica 1.9.2 and Ubuntu Operating system version 14.04.
To understand and practice this tutorial, you need to know the following: equation-based modeling of physical systems ,
branching in any programming language , class definition in Modelica.
Pre-requisite tutorials are mentioned on Spoken Tutorial website. Please go through them.
freeFall class was already discussed in previous tutorials.
Now, let us add a constraint to it.
Ball is at rest until t = 0.5 seconds.  Free fall under gravity starts at time t = 0.5 seconds.
I have created a model named timeEventExample which simulates this condition.
timeEventExample file is available in Code Files link on spoken tutorial website.
Please download and save all the files in Code Files link.
For your convenience, freeFall class is also made available.
Now let me go to OMEdit.
I have already launched it on my system.
To open OMEdit on Ubuntu Operating System, click on Dash Home icon at the top left.
Type: OMEdit in the Search bar and click on OMEdit icon. Let me go back.
Note: Windows users may similarly search for OMEdit in Start menu and open it.
To open timeEventExample file, click on the tool named Open Model/Library File.
Locate timeEventExample file in your system and click on Open.
You may alternatively use the File menu to open this file.
Note that timeEventExample has appeared in Libraries browser.
Right-click on this icon and select View class.
The model has now opened in Diagram view.
Click on third button which is the Text View.
We have already discussed that model and class are used synonymously in Modelica.
The name of this model is timeEventExample.
Comments such as this may be written on the first line of a model or class.
h, v and g represent the same quantities as in freeFall class.
initial equation section contains initial conditions.
Value of h at time t = 0 is 30m.
Value of v at time t = 0 is 0.
Equation signifies the beginning of equation section of this model.
Now, let us see how to insert the constraint explained in slides.
Note that there is an 'if-else'block  in equation section as shown.
Let us try to understand each statement of this 'if-else' block.
'if' statement places a constraint on time variable.
time is a built-in variable in Modelica.
It need not be explicitly declared in a class or model.
The ball experiences free fall after time 0.5 seconds.
Hence, these two equations represent the same equations as those in freeFall class.
'else' branch contains equations which are executed when time is less than 0.5 seconds.
The ball is at rest when time is less than 0.5 seconds.
Hence, these two equations hold good in that case.
end if signifies the end of if-else block.
The model is now complete.
Let us simulate it by clicking on Simulate button.
Plotting perspective has now opened.
Select h in the Variables browser.
This generates h versus time plot.
Since the ball is at rest until time t=0.5 seconds, height remains the same.
To delete the result, right click on timeEventExample in Variables browser and select Delete Result.
To go back to Modeling perspective, click on Modeling button at bottom right.
Now, let me delete the second equation in else branch.
Click on Save button in the toolbar, to save this model.
Click on Simulate.
The simulation has failed.
Go to the Messages browser and scroll up to see the error message.
The error message says that the number of equations in each branch should be the same.
Therefore, the number of equations in if and else branches should each be equal to the number of variables.
Let me insert the equation back in its place and click on Save button.
Note that der(h) = v is an equation which is common to both if and else branches.
Hence, the if-else block can be replaced by two statements.
Let me show you how it is done.
Delete the if-else block first.
The equations to be typed here have been provided in a file named if else-statement.txt.
These file is also available in Code Files link.
Since it is a text file, I have used gedit to open it.
Windows users may open this file using Notepad or any other text editor.
Copy the two equations.
Go back to OMEdit.
Do a right-click and select Paste.
Click on Save button in the toolbar once again.
Click on Simulate.
Close the pop up window.
Select h in the Variables browser once again.
Note that the h versus time plot is the same as in previous case which indicates that both models are the same.
To delete the result, right-click on timeEventExample and select Delete Result.
Click on Modeling button at bottom right.
This is an if-else statement which indicates that if time >= 0.5 dv/dt = g otherwise dv/dt = 0.
Now let me go back to the slides.
Please note that the number of equations in if branch should be equal to the  number of equations in else branch.
And, both of them should be equal to the number of variables in the class or model.
Event is an abrupt change in behavior of a system.
Events may be categorized into time events and state events.
In a time event, the time at which event occurs is precisely known.
timeEventExample handles a time event at t = 0.5 seconds
state event occurs when a system variable crosses a certain value.
Let us try to understand state events using an example.
A ball under free fall faces a state event on touching the ground.
The following behavior is observed when it hits the ground.
Velocity of ball reverts in direction.
Magnitude of velocity changes if the collision is inelastic.
I have created a model named bouncingBall to simulate this behavior.
This file is available on Spoken Tutorial Website.
To view this model and simulate it, let me go back to OMEdit.
Click on OpenModel/LIbrary File tool.
Locate bouncingBall file in your system and click on Open.
Right-click on bouncingBall icon in Libraries browser and select View Class.
If the model does not open in Text View, go to the top of modeling area and click on Text View button.
e is coefficient of restitution for inelastic collision of ball with Earth.
It is a parameter and its value remains constant at 0.8 throughout the simulation run.
radius represents the radius of ball in meter.
h, v and g represent the same quantities as in timeEventExample.
These two equations of motions have already been discussed in freeFall class.
when statement is used to signal an event.
It is used to specify the action to be taken when an event occurs.
h <= radius holds true when the ball is in contact with ground.
This statement is executed whenever the event occurs.
reinit() function is used to re-initialize a variable.
Here, it re-initializes velocity of ball with the negative product of e and velocity of ball before touching the ground.
To simulate this model, click on Simulation Setup button in the toolbar.
Under General tab, change Stop Time field to 30 units and  click on Simulate.
Select h in Variables browser.
Note that h drops below zero which is unacceptable.
We have seen similar behavior while simulating freeFall class.
This faulty behavior is due to numerical errors.
A discussion of numerical errors is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
Please refer to Zeno behavior of bouncing ball for a better understanding.
Let us go back to the slides.
when statement is used to signal an event.
reinit(a,b) assigns value of b to variable a and resumes simulation.
pre(a) returns the value of variable a before event.
For example, reinit(a, 10) assigns a value of 10 to a when  event occurs.
The faulty behavior of bouncingBall model is corrected in bouncingBallWithHysteresis.
bouncingBallWithHysteresis model is available on spoken tutorial website.
Simulate bouncingBallWithHysteresis and generate h versus time plot.
Notice the difference between bouncingBall and bouncingBallWithHysteresis

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Sound Waves.
In this tutorial we will,
Form nodes and antinodes.
View various types of harmonics of a standing wave.
Calculate the wavelength and frequency of standing waves.
Here I am using,
Firefox web browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For the pre-requisite tutorials please visit this site.
Use the given link to download the Apps.
I have downloaded the Apps to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
Right-click on standingwavereflection_en.htm file.
Select the option Open with Firefox Web Browser.
Standing Wave App opens in the browser.
In the green panel under Reflection we have two radio buttons.
By default Reflection from a fixed end is selected.
Below these radio buttons you can see, Reset and Start buttons.
Start button is a toggle for Start, Pause and Resume.
At the bottom of the green panel you can see
These check-boxes are selected by default.
Click on the Start button.
On the yellow panel, observe the propagation of a wave in a string.
The red wave is the Incidenting wave.
The blue wave is the Reflected wave.
Observe that the reflected wave has a phase change of 180 degrees.
Here the incident and reflected waves have the same amplitude.
Let us uncheck the Reflected wave.
If we uncheck any of the check-boxes, we cannot see the corresponding wave.
Click the Reflected wave check-box to make it visible again.
Click on the Pause button to stop the propagation of the waves.
Here is the resultant standing wave.
This wave is formed due to the superposition of incident and reflected waves.
The resultant wave is the constructive superposition of the waves.
Now I will show the superposition of waves in a step-by-step manner.
Click on the Single steps radio button to show the animation step-by-step.
Here a drop down to show various time periods is seen.
By default it is T by 8.
Now click the Resume button three times to show different superpositions.
This is destructive interference of sound waves.
Here the waves are out of phase.
Click on Resume button again.
This is an intermediate superposition of waves.
It lies between the constructive and destructive superpositions.
Again click on the Resume button.
This is constructive interference of the waves.
This is the amplitude of the resulting standing wave.
It is the sum of incident and reflected waves.
For the time period T by 8, one cycle takes three steps to complete.
T by 8 means 1/8th of the total time period.
Let us select T by 24  from the drop-down.
Click on the  Resume button continuously to see various superpositions.
Observe that one superposition cycle now takes five steps.
You can try other options given in the drop-down on your own.
After the reflection from the fixed end, you can see A and N on the string.
Here N is a Node and A is an Antinode.
Let us define a Node and an Antinode.
Node is the point where the particles do not have any motion.
Antinode is the point where the particle oscillates with maximum amplitude.
As an assignment
Observe the reflection by selecting various time period options.
Let us move on to Standing longitudinal wave App.
To open the App right-click on standinglongitudinalwaves_en.htm file.
Select the option Open with Firefox Web Browser.
The App opens in the browser.
Here is the information related to the App interface.
Scroll down to see the interface completely.
This interface shows a tube filled with air molecules.
The blue dots inside the tube represent the air molecules.
Here we can see two plots.
Displacement of particles and Divergence from average pressure.
X axis represents the length of the tube.
Δ(delta)x is the change in displacement of molecules from the equilibrium position.
Δ(delta)p is the Divergence from average pressure.
Observe the pink and red waves.
They show the instantaneous movement of air molecules.
In the green panel, under the heading Form of tube, we have three radio buttons.
By default both sides open radio button is selected.
Next, under Vibrational mode we see two buttons, Lower and Higher.
By default, the App shows the lowest Vibrational mode.
The lowest vibrational mode of the system is known as fundamental.
Fundamental vibrational mode is the first harmonic followed by higher harmonics.
We can change the Length of the tube in this box.
Length of the tube can be varied between 1 meter to 10 meters.
The App calculates the Wavelength and Frequency based on the length of the tube.
Click the Higher button continuously.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to reset the App.
Observe the motion of air molecules.
Molecules in the middle of the tube do not displace from the mean position.
Therefore in the Displacement of particles graph, node is in the middle.
Observe that particles at the extreme positions are oscillating in and out.
Here particles oscillate with maximum amplitude.
Therefore antinode is present at the extreme ends of the X- axis.
Let us move to the second graph.
Observe the movement of particles inside the tube and graph simultaneously.
In the graph, movement of the pink wave shows the changes in the pressure.
As the particles move towards the center, they get compressed.
When they move away pressure decreases.
Under Form of tube, select one side open radio button.
Observe the movement of particles in this form of the tube.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
My Name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany.
In the beginning, I will do something that I always forget to mention.
I always forget to save the image before doing anything to it.
So I go to File, Save as and save this as
"comic.xcf".
‘xcf’ is the Gimp native file format and it keeps all the layers information in the file.
Never save anything in Gimp as JPEG or 'tif' or so, if you want to work further with it.
You can export from there to every format you want to but for anything you want to do further work with, use 'XCF'.
So, what to do? 1st thing I have to clear up this image a bit.
There are two problems here. First, the guy behind me
and second is this clutter, below here.
This statue here is very well placed and I think, it is one of the corner points of this image.
So, let me first take away this stuff here.
So I zoom into the image and select the Pen Tool.
This is best done by Cloning Tool and I don’t have to work very precise here because all this little stuff will vanish in the final image.
So I select the Clone tool and change the size of the Brush.
Now, I press Ctrl and click to get a starting point and now I simply start to paint.
But, before starting that I change the Overlay mode to Normal mode, Opacity to 100 and now let’s start painting.
Image gets a little bit cloudy, so I select another brush to paint.
And now I go here to the border and paint.
So, the guy is gone.
That leaves the clutter here.
I want to keep the flower pot here but this stuff here has to go.
I will take care of this border of the flower pot in a moment.
If I would keep this image in this way, you would see the traces of cloning but they will vanish when I switch on the comic mode.
So, now let's do a bit about the flower pot here.
I think, I should clone from this point.
It doesn't look very convincing in this zoom step but I think it will work.
The comic image basically consists of three parts.
First, there are the black patches or dark patches with no colours which give structure to the image.
Then there are the lines which define forms and items in the image.
And then there is colour and we will start as in the tutorial with the patches.
And for that,
I double this layer and call it ink.
I select the Threshold tool and click into the image and pull the info. window into the image.
You see here, the image is black and white.
This tool divides the image into black and white.
If the pixel is lighter than, at the moment, 82 then the combination of average value of red, green and blue is white.
And if the level is below 82 it becomes black.
Now we face the first problem here.
When I draw this slider around, the effect is very dark.
This value here, 129, would be nice for the left part of my face, the shoulder and for the statue.
This would be nice for the eyes here
and this for other eye.
Now I have to use different ink layer for this image.
So, let's start from the lighter side, like this one here and go back into the image to 100%.
I double this here and select the Threshold tool and pull this slider down.
But before that I have to make the top layer invisible.
I think this value is good for this part of the face.
I make a copy of this layer and make it visible and now I am working on this layer.
I have to look for the middle terms here.
This part of the face, I think this works quite good; so I look around in the image.
The statue is fine too.
This image has a good definition here and near my hand the line is invisible and that is called optical illusion.
I think this is fine and it should be in the image.
Now, I select the Threshold tool, make the line here visible and look at the bright parts to get little bit of definition. So I slide this up.
This looks better.
Now I have 3 copies of my ink layer.
First is ink light .
Top layer is ink dark.
And let's name the middle layer simply ink.
Now let's look at the 3 layers and decide which one is to use mostly.
I think ink layer is a good base because this is too light and this is too dark.
So, I put this layer in the bottom and I add a layer mask to the dark layer and the light layer.
I add a layer mask in black which is fully transparent.
So, everything here gets invisible.
When I draw white on this layer mask of the light layer, the image will be revealed in it.
So, I select the Brush tool here with Normal mode and Opacity 100%.
I think, I shall use a hard brush and the Pressure sensitivity should be the Size. So, when I press the brush on the surface, the dot will be  larger.
My foreground colour is white.
So let's start.
I think the left part of the face should be brightened.
I press 1 to zoom into the image.
I think this brush is too small,  so I scale this a bit up.
That looks better.
But perhaps it is too bright.
This has to be either black or white.
So, I switch the colours with ‘X’ key and paint this over again, here.
But I think, I can leave this out here and put the next layer above that.
Now, we are more concerned about the areas and about the structure. So, I should forget about the lines and just look at the structure here.
Simply leave it as it is.
I can add another layer easily and now I paint for the dark parts with the white colour.
Let's see if I can reveal here a little bit.
I think this is too much.
I want to make the face a bit darker.
And here also.
I think that is too dark.
Here, there is some work still to be done but I will leave it to this here and look at it after I am done with the next step with the lines and then I can adjust here.
This has to be brightened up.
So, we will look at the edit there.
In this step, I have to add some lines and this can be done by doubling the Background layer and putting it on top and naming it lines.
The lines are the edges between different colours.
So, I go to Filters, then we have Edge-detect and here I have Difference of Gaussian Edge Detect.
The relevant slider is the Radius and if you decrease the number, the lines get finer.
If you increase the number, the lines get wider and you get more of the details in the image.
I would prefer something around 10 but I can go to 30 and then decide where exactly I should stop.
When I go to 30, I don't get the edges but areas and 12 would give this here.
And I think I will settle at 10.
I set the Layer mode of this layer to Multiply and for the colour rising I will later need to reduce the white in the image.
Now let's checkout if we have got this right up to now.
So, I will switch the lines layer on and off and you see here there is some definition when the lines layer is on.
And now I de-select the dark ink layer and keep the light ink layer.
The structure that I wanted to have in with my dark ink layer is visible in the lines layer.
So, I will leave the dark ink layer switched off.
I don't think there is a need to combine these layers here.
I will leave it as it is so that I can change something and it will be in the final image.
Next step, as I said, I have to reduce the White channel here and it can be done with the Levels tool and I reduce the level up to 240.
When I switch off this layer, you can see that I have a gray background and little bit of colour information in here.
For getting the colour in the image, I copy the Background layer and name it colour and put it on the top and set the layer mode to Colour.
But it doesn't look good, so I should change the mode.
The image has got little bit of colour in here.
But I want more saturation, so again I make the copy of Background layer and name it saturation.
I set the layer mode to Saturation.
I think this Saturation mode already works and the effects are very good.
There should have been more flatness in the colour and the hand is not looking comic.
I will look where this comes from.
So, I can now start to play with these sliders.
Going down with Saturation gets little bit flatter and looks more like water colours. So, this is a strange effect.
Now I can start to play with the layers here.
So, I switch off the lines layer and you see here that this is not the effect from the lines but from colour and saturation.
Now I can make some adjustments because I still have the layers here.
I want to lighten the face, so I select my ink light layer, select a brush with white foreground colour.
I zoom into the image.
Reduce the size of the brush and scale it a bit and now I start to paint the eye, here.
That's too much.
This looks better.
Now I paint in this part.
This is too much.
You can imagine, there can be lot of modifications in here you can make in the image by changing these areas here.
This is OK.
You can do a lot of changes here and I don't know if I am on the right track.
But I like it up to now.
Let’s see what else we can do.
First thing is, we can use a different layer than the lines.
So, I switch off the lines and I get very strange colours because now I have again a white background.
So add another layer here and set it to white and use Multiply mode and fill it with 240 grey.
Now I have got nearly the same image as with my lines here.
Let me switch them on.
I have the lines information coming out but this comic effect is still there and I can look what’s better.
Let's try some different tricks.
I double the colour and the saturation layers and do something with them.
Here, I just try to get the details out of the image.
So, go to Filters >> Blur and Gaussian Blur.
And here, I choose a value which gives me a nice effect.
You see that the colours have got little bit smoother.
So, let's do this on the saturation copy also.
Go to Filters >> Repeat "Guassian Blur" .
And now I have really flat image with flat colours.
So, I switch on the original colour and I get a strange effect here.
Let's rename these layers as saturation blurred and the colour blurred.
If I combine the blurred saturation with the unblurred colour, I get some colours here which look quite a bit strange.
I would like it if it was not especially on the nose, here.
So, switching this back on and I have this effect here.
You can imagine if you reduce the blurring, you get sharp details.
This is a real play ground.
You have a lot of possibilities here like how to do this, what to do, what to tinker with.
It's really fun to do this.
The author of the original tutorial has done a tremendous job.
I am not so happy with both versions of this image.
I like the structure here and the flower, the statue and the pot here.
I don’t like all the details near the hand and in the face, this could be little bit more flat.
In the blurred on, I like the details in the face and near the hand but I don’t like the flower which is completely blurred away.
So, now I can combine the two images and I will start with colour blurred because I like the over all appearance of this more than of the saturation blurred.
But I switch on all the layers and add layer mask to saturation blurred and colour blurred and I add a Black layer mask, fully transparent.
And now I'll start working on saturation layer mask. So, I select white as my foreground colour and select the Paintbrush here.
Now I start painting.
I just paint over the parts where I want to have little bit more flatness in the image.
This will look a bit strange because now I have the colour layer switched on.
So now, I select everything by pressing Shift+ctrl+A and copy it by Ctrl + C, go into the image and press Ctrl + V and click on insert this Floating Selection and with Ctrl + H or with the anchor layer I have my copy here.
So, you can copy these layer masks too and I think I will leave this image here.
I think it’s so quite nice example and in the end I play a bit with these sliders.
Lets recap this.
You first copy the image layer and make  an inked  image with threshold tool.
Look for areas which you want to have black or very dark.
Then you copy the base image again and make a line layer with the edge detect filter and then you set the layer mode to Multiply.
In this layer, you reduce the white to a gray about 240 with the Levels tool.
Then you copy again the base image and make a colour layer.
Set the colour mode to Colour.
And finally you copy the base layer last time and make a saturation layer and here you set the layer mode to Saturation and now you play with the opacity of the different layers or at some layers.
Just play around. The results are well mixed but some are stunning.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Solr Search and Facets Implementation.
Introduction to Solr search
Salient features of Solr search
Installation of Solr search and
Creation of Facets
To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 16.04
Drupal 8 and  Firefox web browser
To practise this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Drupal.
First let us learn what is an API.
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It has a set of rules that software programs can follow to interact with each other.
More information on API is given in the Additional reading material link of this tutorial.
What is Solr Search API?
Solr is an open source search platform used to build a Search Application.
It enables us to create custom search engines that index databases, files and websites.
Why do we need Solr Search API?
The default search that comes with Drupal does database search.
It leads to slower process and extra load on MySQL.
But Solr provides a different server for searching. It will speed up the search operation.
Some of the features of Solr are listed here.
It is scalable.
It has full text search capabilities.
It is flexible and extensible.
It has a friendly user interface.
It has fault tolerance.
Next we will learn about Solr core.
Solr core is used to perform operations like indexing and analyzing
It is a single index and associated configuration files
We can index data with different structures
A Solr server may contain one or more cores
Multiple cores are used when we need multiple versions, languages, or configurations
In this example there is one core each for Articles and Weblogs in a single Solr Server Instance.
Next let us learn the Solr implementation process step by step.
The following steps are applicable to Bitnami Drupal Stack.
But most of the steps are applicable to any other Drupal installation, as well.
Step No. 1 - Open your terminal and run the following commands to update and upgrade your machine.
Note that you should run this command as a root user.
Step No. 2 - Since Solr is based on Java, we need to have JRE or JDK installed in our system.
For this, first we need to install python software properties.
So run the following command.
Note that you should run the upcoming commands as a normal user.
Next we will run this command for setting up the JRE.
Then to update the system with the unsupported packages, type sudo space add hyphen apt space update. Press Enter.
Finally run the following command to install the latest version of oracle Java8.
Now we can check the installed Java version by typing java space hyphen version.
Next we have to set-up the default Java environment variable.
So, run the following command.
Step No. 3. Next we will learn to install Solr in our local machine.
First we have to change the directory to tmp.
Now we will download the Solr version 6.6.3 from their web page.
Type the following command.
Note that you can download any latest version from their website.
Next we will extract the tar file using the following command.
Now we should install Solr as a service in our system.
So type the following command.
Then we will check the status of Solr by typing service space Solr space status
We can see that the service Solr is installed in our system and activated as well.
Step No. 4
Type the following command carefully.
Here I have named the newly created core as testcollection.
By default solr application listens on TCP port 8983.
So,we can access the Solr admin user interface through the port 8983.
In the URL bar, type
In the Core Selector field, we can see the list of all the available core.
Clicking on any particular core, will give us the associated details.
That is all about Solr installation in our local system.
Step No. 5, Next we will implement the Solr search API in Drupal8.
For this, mbstring extension of PHP and composer should be installed in our machine.
The steps to install the above software are given in the Additional reading material link of this tutorial.
Once the required installation is done, change the directory to htdocs of Drupal.
After this, we need to install solarium library in Drupal8.
Solarium is a Solr client library for PHP.
Execute the following command to install it.
Next we will install search API Solr module to Drupal8 via composer.
Type the following command.
We will also download Facets module to Drupal8 to be used later on.
Type the following command. At this point, we have downloaded all the required modules.
Step No. 6 - Next go to the Drupal8 site and enable the modules that we have installed.
Go to Extend tab.
Put a check mark on the modules Facets, Search API, Solr search and Solr Search Defaults.
Click on the Install button at the bottm, to enable them.
We can see that all the four modules have been installed.
Now we have to disable the default Search module of Drupal8 named Search.
To do so, click on the Uninstall tab in the Extend page.
Put a check mark on the Search module and click on the Uninstall button at the bottom.
Again click on the Uninstall button to confirm.
Next we have to allow our Drupal to communicate with Solr.
For that, switch back to terminal and run the following command carefully.
This will copy the configuration files from modules folder of Drupal8 to the core of Solr.
After copying the configuration files, to restart the Solr service, type sudo space service space solr space restart
Step No. 7
To do so, go to Configuration tab.
Click on the Search API under SEARCH AND METADATA.
Right now we can see that the Solr server could not be reached.
Click on Edit of Solr Server.
Scroll down. In the Solr core field, type your core name.
I will type testcollection.
Leave the other settings as default and click on the Save button at the bottom, for saving the configuration.
Now we can see that the server connection could be reached and the core connection could be accessed.
Step No. 8
Click on the Edit button of Default Solr content index.
We can change the settings as per our requirements.
For now, I will keep them as it is and click on the Save button at the bottom.
We can see right now 0 items are indexed in the Solr server.
To index all the content, click on the Index now button at the bottom.
We can see all the 20 contents are indexed in the Solr server.
With this we have successfully enabled both the Solr server and index.
Step No. 9 . Next let us learn to search our content using the Solr search.
For that, first go to Structure, then Views.
We can see the Solr search content view here.
Click on the Edit button of Solr search content.
Note that Solr search content is a page which can be accessed on the path /Solr-search/content.
We can also see the preview of the view.
Now we will access the Solr search content page.
In the URL bar, type
If you are not using Bitnami Drupal Stack, please use localhost instead of localhost:8080.
The Solr search content page appears now. In the Search field, type Drupal. Press Enter
It displays few results which are having the word “Drupal” in their content.
Step No. 10 Next we will learn to create Facets for categorizing the search results.
For doing so, go to Configuration tab.  Click on the Facets under SEARCH AND METADATA.
Click on the Add facet button.
In the Facet source drop down, select the source.
In the Field drop down, we will select the Title as facet field.
In the Name field, I will type Title as a name of this Facet.
Finally click on the Save button to save the configuration.
Here you can select the widget from the available types.
I am selecting List of links for now.
Leave the remaining settings on default and click on the Save button to save the configuration.
Step No. 11
For that go to Structure → Block layout.
To place the block in the Sidebar second region, click on the Place block button.
In the dialog box that appears, select the Facet named Title.
Configure the block as per your need. Click Save block button.
The Facet is added in the  Sidebar second region.
Step No. 12
In the Search field, type Drupal. Press Enter.
It displays few results which have the word “Drupal” in their content.
We can also see Facet displaying the titles which have Drupal as a word in their content.
This is all about the implementation of Solr search and Facets in Drupal8.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to-  install Solr application
Install essential modules via composer
configure Solr search API and  configure Facets

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Categories in Moodle.
Learners of this tutorial should have Moodle 3.3 installed on their system.
If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website.
Switch to the browser and open your 'Moodle' homepage. Make sure that the XAMPP service is running.
Login with your admin username and password details.
On the left side, click on Site Administration.
Click on the Courses tab and then Manage courses and categories.
We will be directed to a page with the title Course and category management. Let us understand what a course category is.
Course categories help to organize Moodle courses for the site users.
The default category for a new Moodle site is Miscellaneous.
Any new course will be assigned to this Miscellaneous category, by default.
However, it will be difficult for teachers and students to find their courses.
To make it easier to locate courses, they should be assigned in categories.
Most institutions organize courses by campus or department.
It is good to have descriptive names for better clarity.
We will go ahead and organize our courses by departments.
Let us switch back to the Moodle site.
First we will understand the Course and category management page layout.
On the left, we have the Navigation block. And on the right, we have the Content region.
The content region is divided into 2 columns:
By default, it is showing courses under Miscellaneous category.
This view can be changed from the menu located at the right.
Click on the down arrow to see the options.
Now click on Course categories. This changes the view to show only the course categories.
Let us click on the arrow again and change the view to see only the courses.
Notice that a new drop-down box has appeared now. This is the category drop-down.
Here, we can select the category for which we want to show the courses.
Let us change the view back to Course categories and courses.
Now we will click on Create new category link to add a category.
Click on the Parent category dropdown box and select Top. Type: Mathematics in the Category name.
Category ID number is an optional field. This is for admin users to identify the course with offline courses.
If your college uses ID for categories, you can use that category ID here. This field is not visible to other Moodle users.
For now, I will leave Category ID as blank.
In the Description textbox, I will type-
Then click on Create category button.
We are now in the Course categories and courses view.
Here we can see 2 categories now: Miscellaneous and Mathematics.
Let us organize these categories further.  Let us have separate 1st year Maths courses and 2nd year Maths courses.
For this, we will create a subcategory called 1st Year Maths, inside the Mathematics category.
Click on Create new category link at the top of the listed categories.
Creation of the subcategory is same as that of a category.
Don’t select Top as the parent category.
Instead, select the category under which this subcategory should belong.
So here, we will type: 1st Year Maths in the category name.
After that, we’ll type a Description and click on Create category button.
Notice that the categories on the left are listed in a tree format.
A category which has subcategories has a toggle icon to expand and collapse it.
Notice 3 icons on the right of the category.
Hover over the icons to see what they are.
The eye is for hiding the category.
A hidden category will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.
The arrow is for moving the category up or down.
Click on the settings gear icon for Miscellaneous category.  It has options such as Edit, Create new subcategory, Delete etc. related to the category.
Click elsewhere on the page to close this menu.
Let me collapse the navigation menu on the left for better view.
Next, click on the settings gear icon for Mathematics category.
Notice that there are 4 extra submenus here related to sorting of the subcategories.
All categories that have subcategories will have these menu items.
The number to the right of the gear icon indicates the number of courses in that category.
There are sorting options below the list of categories.
At the end, is the option to change the parent category of a subcategory.
To use this option, you have to check the check-box next to the subcategory you want to move.
Then select the new parent category and click on Move.  We will not use this option right now.

Thank you for joining.
Hello friends and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Additional Features of IPython.
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to: retrieve your IPython history,
view a part of the history,
save a part of a history to a file,
run a script from within IPython.
To practice this tutorial, you should know how to
Let us now open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously.
Let us initialise the pylab package. Type percentage pylab and press Enter.
To start plotting, type: x is equal to linspace inside the brackets minus 2pi comma 2pi comma 100  and press Enter.
Next, type: plot inside the brackets x comma xsin(x) and press Enter.
We got an error saying "xsin is not defined".
Here, the multiplication sign is missing. So, let us now type:
Next, let us add title and the labels for both x and y axes.
Type: xlabel inside the brackets inside inverted commas inside dollar sign x  and press Enter.
ylabel inside the brackets inside inverted commas inside dollar sign f(x) .
title inside the brackets inside inverted commas inside dollar sign x and xsin(x).
We can now see the labelled plot.
The history of typed commands can be retrieved by the  percentage history command.
Type: percentage history and press Enter.
percentage history itself is a command and is displayed as the most recent command.
Whatever we executed in the terminal, is stored as history.
If we want to see what was the fifth command, pass 5 as an argument to percentage history  command.
Type: percentage history space 5 and press Enter.
Now, pause the video here and try out the following exercise and resume the video.
Find out how to list the recent commands between 5 and 10.
Let us look at the solution.
Type clf() and press Enter.
Read through the information of percentage history command.
We can see, percentage history hyphen n 4 hyphen 6 displays the commands from 4 to 6.
Here, hyphen n is an optional argument which prints the line numbers.
Now, type: percentage history space 5 hyphen 10 and press Enter.
To save the history, we use the percentage save command.
Before we do that, let us first look at the history and identify which lines of code we require.
Type percentage history and press Enter.
The second command is linspace.
Hence we do not need it.
The commands from fourth to seventh are required.
So, we need the second command and then the fourth to seventh commands for our program.
Let us save it in the present working directory. Hence the syntax will be-
The first argument in percentage save command is the name of the file in which the commands are saved.
The second argument gives the numbers of the commands that are being saved separated by spaces.
Let us now open the file plot underscore script.py and see the contents.
Let us learn how to run the file as a python script.
Type: percentage run space hyphen i space plot underscore script.py and press Enter.
Here, hyphen i parameter runs the code written in a text editor.
It uses the variables defined interactively in the ipython session.
The script runs but we do not see the plot.
This is because when we are running a script, we are not in the interactive mode.
To view the plot, type show() on your terminal and press Enter.
Pause the video here and try out the following exercise and resume.
Use percentage history and percentage save to create a script that has the function show() in it.
Run the script to produce the plot and display the same.
Let us look at the solution.
Type: percentage history space hyphen n and press Enter.
Let us clear the plot window.
Now, let us save the script using the command percentage save.
We need the lines 2, then 4 to 7 and 16.
Type: percentage save space show underscore included.py space 2 space 4 hyphen 7 space 16 and press Enter.
To run the script, type:
We get the desired plot.
Go to the previous command.
We see that it raises a NameError saying that the name 'linspace' is not defined.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:
view only a part of history by passing argument to percentage history command,
save the required lines of code, in required order using percentage save command.
Use 'percentage run space hyphen i' command to run a saved script.
Here are some self assessment questions.
How do you save the command lines 2 3 4 5 7 9 10 and 11?
percentage save filename 2-5 7 9 hyphen 11
percentage save filename 2 hyphen 11
percentage save filename
Which is the command to run the script?
percentage run hyphen i script name
percentage execute hyphen i script name
And the solutions are-
To run the script, we use percentage run space hyphen i space scriptname.

In this tutorial, we will learn about: What are static variables,
creating static variables and how to use static variables.
You should also have the knowledge of classes, objects  and instance variables in Java.
A static variable is a variable which is associated with the entire class.
It is also called a class variable.
It is declared using the static keyword.
We have seen about static variable briefly in the earlier tutorial.
In this tutorial, we will see it in detail.
Now, we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticVariableDemo.
Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static variables.
So, right-click on src folder and click New > Class and type the name of the class as StudentEnroll and press Enter.
Let us illustrate the usage of static variables with an example.
Consider a class created to represent student enrollments in an organisation.
This class contains the Name, Id , Branch and Total Count of students enrolled.
Now, let us visualize what happens when student enrollments are done.
By default, Total Count is 0. The Name of the first student is ADIL.
Id is IT101, Branch is IT.
Now the Total Count is updated as 1.
Similarly when the second student AMAL gets enrolled, Total Count is updated to 2.
When the third student CAROL gets enrolled, Total Count is updated to 3.
Now we can identify that the variable Total Count is common to all the objects and has a single value.
So, the variable Total Count can be represented as a static variable.
We can also see that the variables Name, Id and Branch have their own copies for each object.
Also they have specific values for each object.
So, these variables can be treated as instance variables.
Now, let us look at the code representing the student Enroll class.
The instance variables are declared as id, name and branch.
The variable count is declared as static since it is common to the whole class.
When a class is loaded, a static variable occupies a single fixed memory location.
Whereas Instance variables of each object occupy separate memory locations.
Now click on Source > and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
This constructor can initialise the values of the id, name and branch fields.
We also need to increment the value of the variable count by one every time an object is created.
So, inside the constructor, type: count ++ semicolon.
Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class, to print the values of all the variables.
So, type public void showData( )  within brackets type the following code to print the values of id, name, branch, and total number of students enrolled.
Now right-click on the default package and click on New > Class and then type name as Demo.
Inside this class, we will have the main method.
So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method.
Now we need to print the Student Enrollment data.
So, type the following code:  StudentEnroll s1 equals new StudentEnroll.
Now we can pass the values of different arguments.
Within brackets, type IT101 as id, ADIL as name and IT as branch.
So, type: s1.showData( ). Now run the Demo program.
We can see that the values of the instance variables corresponding to s1 get printed.
Also note that the value of the number of student enrollments is 1.
This is because we have created only 1 object.
Now type the following code to create one more object s2.
The showData method can be called once again using s2.
Again run the Demo Program.
We can see that the values of the instance variables corresponding to s2 get printed.
Also, note that the value of number of student enrollments is updated to 2 for both s1 and s2.
Now create one more object s3.
Now let us Invoke the showData method again using s3.
Run the Demo program again.
We can see that the values of instance variables corresponding to s3 get printed.
Also note that the value of number of student enrollments is now updated to 3 in all the cases.
Now we can understand that value of number of student enrollments is common to all the objects.
Come back to slides.
The static modifier is also used along with the final modifier.
It is done to define a constant which is common to the entire class.
Conventionally, the names of such constant variables are spelt in uppercase letters.
Now come back to eclipse.
Open the StudentEnroll class and type the variable declaration as  public static final String ORG_NAME = “IITB”;
As an example, if all the students are getting enrolled to the same organisation, say IITB.
It can be represented by using a constant static variable say ORG_NAME.
If the name is composed of more than one word, the words are separated by an underscore.
Usually we declare such constants with a public visibility.
Now go to the Demo class and type the following code.
Here you can see that ORG_NAME is accessed by using its class name StudentEnroll.
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the ORGANISATION name is getting printed as IITB.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:
What is a static variable and when it is used
How to create and invoke the static variables.
As an Assignment, design a class CarService to represent a car service station.
This class should contain variables to represent the following details: Name of the Service Station,
Car make, model and register number - which are in for service
No. of Cars in for Service.
Identify the instance variables and static variables.
Declare them using suitable keywords.
Define a constructor to initialise the values for Car make, model and register number.
Define a method show( ) to print the values of all the variables.
Also, create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results
Invoke the show( ) method using these objects.
Also, access the static variables directly using the class name.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to: Password protect a spreadsheet
Click OK.Now, let’s try to select and modify data in a cell.
We are not able to select any cell!
The sheet cannot be modified!
But what about the other sheets?
Let’s click on Sheet2.
Let’s select a cell and try to edit it.
Calc allows us to edit the cells in the other sheets.
Let’s go back to the first sheet.
Now, let’s un-protect the sheet.
This is simple.
From the Menu bar, click on “Tools” > “Protect Document” and “Sheet”.
A dialog-box that requests for the password, appears.
Enter “abc” in small case in it and click OK.
We are able to select the cells again!
Let’s learn about Ranges.
You can define a range of cells in a spreadsheet and use it as a database.
Each row in this database range corresponds to a database record and
each cell in a row corresponds to a database field.
You can sort, group, search and perform calculations on the range as you would in any database.
Let’s define a database in “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” and sort the data.
First, let’s select the items which we require in the database.
Let’s select all the data under the heading “SN” to "Account" together. We have already learnt how to select data.
Now, let’s name our database.
From the Menu bar, click Data and then click on Define Range.
In the “Name” field, type “dtbs” which is the short-form of database.
Again, from the Menu bar, click Data and Select Range.
Notice that in the “Select Database Range” dialog-box that appears, the name “dtbs” is listed as a database.
Click on the OK button.
Now, let’s sort the data in this database.
From the Menu bar, click Data and Sort.
In the Sort dialog-box that appears, click the “Sort by”  field and select “SN”.
Next, from the right side, select “Descending”.
Under the first “Then by” field, click on the drop-down and select “Cost”.
Again, from the right side, select “Descending”.
In the second “Then by” field, click on the drop-down, select “Spent” and then again select “Descending”.
The data is sorted under the heading “SN” and in the descending order!
In a similar manner, we can perform other operations in the database too!
Let’s press the CTRL+Z keys to undo the sort and get the original data.
Now, let’s learn how to use the “Subtotal” option in Calc.
The “Subtotal” option, calculates the grand total of data under different headings, using a mathematical function of our choice.
Let’s find the subtotal of the data under the heading “Cost”.
First, let’s delete the entry in row number 8.
select all data under SN to ACCOUNT together.
Next, from the Menu bar, click Data and Subtotals.
In the Subtotals dialog-box that appears, from the “Group by” field, let us select “SN”.
This groups the data by Serial Number.
Next, in the “Calculate subtotals for” field, click on the “Cost” option.
This will calculate the total of all the entries under it.
Under the “Use function” field , let’s choose “Sum” and click OK.
Notice that the “Grand total” of the entries, under the heading “Costs”, is displayed on the spreadsheet.
On the left side of the sheet there are 3 new tabs “1”, ”2”and “3”.
These tabs give 3 different views of the data.
Let’s click on tab 1.
Notice that only the grand total of the data under “Costs” is displayed.
Click on tab “2” .
The data under “Costs” as well as the grand total is displayed.
Now, click on tab “3”.
We get the detailed view of the sheet along with the grand total of the data under “Costs”.
Let’s close this file.
A dialog-box with the message Save or Discard changes appears.
Click Discard.
Now, let’s re-open the file.
Now, let’s learn about the “Validity” option in LibreOffice Calc.
The “Validity” option validates data in the spreadsheet.
This is done by specifying the “Validation rules” for the selected cells in the spreadsheet.
For example- in “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”, we can specify the mode of payment for the items bought, using Validation.
Now, let us delete the heading “Date” and its contents.
Let us give another heading for “Mode of Payment” as “M-O-P”, next to the heading “Received”.
Below the heading “M-O-P”, the cells can be used to display the mode of payments for the data entries under the heading “Items”.
That is, ”Salary”, ”Electricity Bills” and the other components.
Now, let us click on the empty cell just below the heading ”M-O-P”.
This will have the mode of payment for the component “Salary”.
Now, from the Menu bar, click “Data” and “Validity”.
The Validity dialog-box appears.
Let’s click the “Criteria” tab.
From the “Allow” field drop-down, click “List”.
The “Entries” box pops-up.
Let’s enter the options which will appear on validating the selected cell.
Let’s type the first mode of payment as “In Cash” and then press the Enter key from the keyboard.
Next, let’s type the second mode of payment as “Demand Draft”.
The selected cells are validated!
Now, press the down-arrow that is displayed alongside.
Can you see the options that we entered as Mode of Payments in the Entries box?
To validate the cells below, first click on the Format Paintbrush option on the toolbar.
Then, select the cells below the validated cell by pressing the left mouse button and then dragging along the cells.
Now, release the mouse button.
All the selected cells are validated in the same manner.
Now, click on the cell just below the heading “M-O-P” and then click on the down-arrow.
Both the options for mode of payment are displayed.
Let’s select the In Cash option.
In the same manner, you can select “Cash” or “Demand Draft” in each of the validated cells according to the mode of payment made.
To summarize, we have learnt how to: Password protect a spread sheet

Welcome to this tutorial on Writing Commands in Chimera.
In this tutorial, we will type commands to-  change the display to atoms,
show and hide ribbons,
change the color of the amino acid residues,
label individual residues,
remove solvent molecules and save the image in different file formats.
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of-  undergraduate Biochemistry,
must be familiar with Structural Biology   and Chimera interface.
To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu OS version  14.04,
Mozilla firefox browser 42.0   and a working internet connection.
Double-click on the Chimera icon to open the Chimera window.
Click on the lightning bolt icon to open the graphics window.
In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to use commands to manipulate the structure.
Open the Command Line using Favorites menu.
A command text box appears at the bottom of the Chimera window.
Tasks performed with menus can be carried out using commands.
About Chimera Commands-
Chimera commands are entered at the Command line.
Multiple commands can be combined into one line with semicolon separators.
Press Enter key to execute the command.
Previous commands can be accessed from command History.
More information about commands is given at the link shown.
Back to the Chimera window. Let us open a model of leucine zipper by typing a command.
The command starts with a command word.
On the command line text box, type- "open space 1zik".
You need a working internet connection for this step.
The structure appears on the screen.
To change the ribbons display to atoms- in the command line text box, type the command word display . Press Enter.
We now have the structure of the protein in atoms display.
The structure is partially represented as ribbons.
To hide the ribbons- type the wave symbol, also known as tilda,  followed by the command word ribbon.
A command with a tilda indicates the reverse function.
Here, tilda symbol followed by ribbon keyword hides the ribbons.
We can use color command to set colors to atoms, bonds, surfaces etc.
For example, to change the color of all leucines, type:
For leucine, I will type leu.
Here, color is command word with argument as yellow and the target is all leucines in the structure.
If you do not specify a target, the entire structure will be colored in yellow.
Observe the panel. All the leucines are now colored yellow.
We can specifically color an amino acid present at a particular location.
For example, to change the color of histidine, present at position 18 on chain B, type -
Observe the panel. histidine is now colored in red.
To change the display of the entire structure to CPK spacefill, type rep .
rep is the truncated version for the keyword represent. rep space sphere ; press Enter.
To bring back the structure to stick display, again type rep space stick
To hide the solvent molecules from the structure, type - del (for delete) space solvent
To activate residues for selection, use select command word.
On the command line text box type: select space colon followed by the number and chain of the residue.
For example, to activate the lysine present at the position 28, on chain B,  type:select space colon followed by 28 dot B . Press Enter.
Now, to show the label for the residue selected, type: rlabel space sel
Observe the panel. The residue label for the selected residue is displayed.
To de-select the residue which we have selected earlier, press up-arrow key to get the select command.
Type the tilda symbol at the beginning of the command. Press Enter.
A list of keywords and command index is available in the Help menu.
Click on the Help menu, scroll down and click on Commands index.
A web-page opens with the list of keywords to write commands.
If you want to change the background color from black to blue, type: background space solid space blue
The panel is now blue in color.
To view the Command history, click on the black triangle present at the right side of the Command line.
The Command history lists previously used commands.
Commands can be re-executed by clicking on the command.
To hide the command line, click on Hide command line option in the drop-down.
There are many options to save the structure you have created. Open the File menu.
You can: Restore a Session, Save a Session,
save the image in JPEG or PNG formats,
save the image as PDB or Mol2 files, Export the scene etc.
For demonstration, let me save the image in JPEG format.
Click on Save image option. A Save image dialog box opens.
Select the file location as Desktop.
Type the File name as 1zik. Choose the File type as JPEG.
Fix the image size according to your requirement.
For demonstration, I will type 800 as width and 600 as height.
Click on Save button. The image is saved as 1zik.jpg on the Desktop.
In this tutorial, we typed commands to:  change the display to atoms,
show and hide ribbons,
change the color of the amino acid residues,
label individual residues,
remove solvent molecules,  save the image in different file formats.
Now for the assignment:
Change the display to atoms and hide ribbons.
Color all histidine residues in green.
Remove the solvent molecules and save the image in JPEG format.

Welcome to the series of Blender tutorials.
In this tutorial, we shall look at the hardware specifications and requirements for Blender 2.59.
This script has been contributed by Chirag Raman.
First Up, we shall look at what the official Blender website has to say about the hardware requirements.
Open your internet browser.
I am using Firefox 3.09.
In the address bar, type: www.blender.org and hit the Enter  key.
This should take you to the official blender website.
For ease of demonstration, I have already loaded the System Requirements page.
Blender is Free and Open Source.
Blender 2.59 works on nearly all operating systems.
For this tutorial, I am using Windows XP operating system.
Different parts of Blender are dependent on different pieces of computer hardware.
A faster CPU and more RAM can help to increase rendering speed while the speed of the Blender interface, viewports and real-time engine is influenced by the speed of the graphics card.
Fast and large hard drives can also speed up work when dealing with large video files.
As you can see, the Blender Organization shows Hardware Specifications for 3 sections of usage:
Minimum, Good and Production levels.
The Minimum hardware specifications required to run Blender are –
1 GHZ Single Core CPU
512 MB RAM
1024 x 768 pixels Display with 16 bit color
3 Button Mouse
Open GL Graphics Card with 64 MB RAM
The Good specifications level includes –
2 GHZ Dual Core CPU
2 GB RAM
1920 x 1200 pixels Display with 24 bit color
3 Button Mouse
Open GL Graphics Card with 256 or 512 MB RAM
Production level hardware specifications will be –
64 bits, Multi Core CPU
8-16 GB RAM
Two times 1920 x 1200 pixels Display with 24 bit color
3 Button Mouse + tablet
Open GL Graphics Card with 1 GB RAM, ATI FireGL or Nvidia Quadro
To make sure you meet any one of the specified levels, you need to check your system configuration.
Minimize your browser window.
Go to the  Control Panel. Once here, double click on the   System  icon.
So, here you can see the current specifications of your machine and compare it against what the Blender Foundation suggests.
Most Windows Operating systems are either 32-bit or 64-bit. I am using 32-bit Windows.
The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way the CPU handles information.
The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts RAM more effectively than a 32-bit system.
Also, if you are planning to invest in a new computer for Blender,
it would be a good idea to check out this article over at www.blenderguru .com/the-ultimate-guide-to-buying-a- computer-for-blender.
This guide gives you detailed information about Operating system,
CPU,
RAM,
Graphics card,
Case,
and hard drive.
So, that completes the tutorial on the Hardware Requirements for running Blender.
More information on the same is available at the following links. oscar.iitb.ac.in and spoken-tutorial.org/NMEICT-Intro.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Installation of Drupal.
In this tutorial, we will learn to download and install  Drupal on Ubuntu Linux and Windows operating systems.
For this tutorial, you will need -
You should also have a machine installed with either  Ubuntu Linux or  Windows Operating System.
To follow this tutorial, you should  be familiar with either of the mentioned operating systems.
There are many ways to install Drupal.
For this tutorial. I will use Bitnami Drupal Stack as this is a very simple installation method.
To install Bitnami Drupal Stack, you will need:
Minimum of 256 MB RAM
Minimum of 150 MB hard drive space and
TCP/IP protocol support.
Following are the compatible operating systems:
Any x86 Linux operating system
Any 32-bit Windows operating system such as Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2012.
Any OS X operating system x86.
Let’s open our preferred web browser and go to the URL shown.
Scroll down and check installers for Windows and Linux operating systems.
You have to choose the installer as per your operating system.
As I am a Linux user, I will choose the Linux installer.
If you are a Windows user, choose the Drupal installer for Windows.
Here, we can see all the different versions of Drupal.
If you are unsure about which version to download, you can download the "Recommended" version.
At the time of this recording, Drupal 8.1.3 is the Recommended version.
It could be different when you try.
Click on the Download button at the right hand side.
A popup window appears prompting us to create an account in Bitnami website.
For now, click on “No thanks”.
Immediately, it will start downloading the installer. Click on OK button to save the file.
The following installation steps are same for the Windows and Linux OS.
If you have been provided with Bitnami installer files, use one of that instead of downloading.
Open your Downloads folder where the installer file has been downloaded.
To run this installer file, we should have admin access.
If you are a Windows user, right click on the installer file. And then select Run as administrator option.
If you are a Linux user, right click on the installer file and select Properties.

Click on each component and read the detailed information about them first.
I prefer to have all the components selected. Click on Next button.
In this window, we have to choose the folder where we want to install Drupal.
I will choose my Home folder.
In Windows, it will be installed by default in C colon or the main drive.
Now, we have to create a Drupal admin account.
I will type the real name as "Priya".  This name will be displayed in the application.
Please type your own name here.
In the Email Address field, I will type  "priyaspoken@gmail.com".
Please use your own valid email address.
Next, we have to give our preferred username and password for the administrator.
In Login user name, I will type "admin".
In Password, I will type a password. Re-type the password for confirmation.
You can type any login name and password as per your choice.
Click on the Next button.
In Linux, the default listening port for Apache is 8080 and for MySQL it is 3306.
In Windows, it is 80 and 3306.
If those ports are already in use by other applications, it will prompt for alternate ports to use.
I have already installed MySQL on my machine. So, it prompts for an alternate port.
I will give 3307.
Click on the Next button.
Now, we have to give a name to our Drupal site. I will type the name as Drupal 8.
You can give any name as per your choice.
Click on the Next button.
Here, it asks us for Bitnami Cloud Hosting. For now, I do not want this.
So, click on the check-box to deselect it.
Now, Drupal is ready to be installed. Click on the Next button.
It could take several minutes to complete the installation.
Once the installation is finished, make sure the Launch Bitnami Drupal Stack is checked.
Then click on the Finish button.

Bitnami Drupal Stack control window will be open.
Everytime when you open Drupal, please check whether all the servers are running.
Click on Manage Servers tab to see all the running services.
Here we can see that MySQL Database and Apache Web Server are running now.
Note that to work on Drupal, we need a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle
and a web server such as Apache or Nginx.
By default, Bitnami Drupal Stack comes with MySQL database and Apache web server.
Let’s switch back to the control window.
We can start, stop and restart the services by clicking on the appropriate buttons.
Let's click on the Welcome tab.
To start Drupal, click on Go to Application button on the right hand side.
The browser opens up automatically with the bitnami page.
Now, click on Access Drupal link. We are redirected to our Drupal website.
Notice that the website name is Drupal 8.
To login to the website, click on Log in link at the top right corner.
Let’s type our user name and password which we created earlier.
Now, click on the Login button.
In the address bar, we can see the web address of our website
In the next tutorial, we will learn what is /user/1.
Instead of this localhost, it may show you 127.0.0.1, based on your system configuration.
Next time onwards, we can access Drupal using the web address:
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about Installation of Drupal on Ubuntu Linux and Windows operating systems.

The Spoken Tutorial Project team-
I am Saurabh Sawant, from IIT Bombay. Thank you.
Welcome.  In this tutorial, we will talk about how users can change their password.
We will learn how to give the users the option to change their password if they want to.
This shouldn’t take too long.  It will be covered in 3 parts.
We’ll give the user a form and ask the users to type their old password and their new password twice.
We will check their old password, the one that’s in the database.
Remember,  they’re encrypted.
Then we will compare the two new passwords to see if they match, to see if they’ve made any mistake.
Next we will update the database using the sql codes.
So, first of all I will start my session on my "member" page. As you can see we’ve got our "session_start()" here.
I’ll just copy and paste that to the top of my page. So, we’ve started our session.
We need to use a variable called "$user" which will be equal to the '$_SESSION' that we’ve set over here.
First, we need to check that the users have logged in - this is the code I was talking about - before we start to change their password or let them change their password,
I’ll set this "user" variable as our "session" name which is here.
Okay, now we will say “ if the user exists”, we’ll let them change their password otherwise we kill the page and say “You must be logged in to change your password".
This is the block for “User is logged in”. So, assuming the user has logged in, after we’ve checked for the existence of the login, we need to give them a form to fill up.
I'll echo out our code here which will be our form. It’s a self- submitting form, so it’ll to go back to "change password dot php" and end the form here.
So, that's the page we are already on and so I’ll use a check to verify all the details.
The method of the form is POST because we don’t want to let any password information into the URL.
Next, we’ll create a few input boxes. First, “Old password:” which won't be a password type, so the entry won't be hidden. So, input type will be "text" and name will be "oldpassword".
I’ll put a paragraph break. Next is "New password:" and I will create an input type as "password" so that it is hidden from everyone. The name will be “new password”.
I'll put a line-break here. Now copy paste this sentence and make a few changes. The label here will be “Repeat new password” and the name will be "repeat new password" followed by a paragraph break.
Lastly we need a “submit" button. The name will be "submit", so we can check if that’s being pressed and the value will be "Change password".
Okay, so let’s go to our page. I’ll stick a link in the members’ page in order to help us change our password.
For now, I’ll just login using the details. My password at the moment is “abc" and my 'username' is “Alex”.
Click on Login. It says "Welcome Alex". Here is the member page. The session has been set. If we need to log out, we can log out. But we need another option to change our password.
So, we go back to our "member dot php" page and I’ll create another link
and that will be “Change password”.
And this will link  to the “change password dot php".
So if we refresh this, we’ll get another option. Click here and we get our form that we had created earlier. I'll type my old password here and my new passwords in here.
Click "Change password" but nothing happens.  So, we want to check whether this has been submitted or not. Delete this extra line here.
What we need to do is: create an if statement to say “if POST submit” which just means "has the user pressed this 'submit' button?". The name is 'submit', therefore we’ve got 'submit' written here.
And if the user has submitted then we start changing our password here.
Otherwise, if the user hasn’t submitted, we’re going to echo out this code here.
If the user hasn’t already submitted, then they’ll have to present with the form here, in order to submit the form.
Let’s go ahead and test this. What we’ll do here is echo out “test” to see if this works.
Let's go back and fill in. Actually we don’t need to fill anything. We will just click the submit button. And we get an echo of  “test” to show that our form has been submitted successfully.
Ok, so we need to start changing the password.  Delete this and here we will say “check fields”.
We’ve got a few variables that we need to set - our '$old password' which will be equal to 'POST' variable name “old password”. We have given that name down here in our form.
And I’ll just replicate these for each value that we are submitting.
Next one is “new password” and then we have “repeat new password”. We’ll just change these.
To make sure these are working and I do recommend you do this all the time, echo out “old password”, “new password” and ”repeat new password”.
It checks for the form existence, whether the form has been submitted and then we get our variables and our post variables into the variable name.
I’ll echo out what we’ve typed in the box, just to see if everything is working.
So, my old password is “abc” and my old password is “123”. Click Change password  and we get abc, 123 and 123.
So, that form information has been submitted.  There are no spelling mistakes.  I can be confident that I can get my user to set up a new password.
I’m going to stop the tutorial now. In the next part, I'll teach how to check the old password against the new password in the database, how to check if the new password and the repeated password match and then to change the user’s password.

Thank you for joining
Ashok comes home from his farm and complains about fever and body ache.
His wife, Anita, looks at him and notices blisters on his hands and legs.
She is scared and says that the wrath of the Goddess has befallen on her husband.
She asks her children to get out of the house soon.
The mother and children come out of the house and lock the door from outside.
Meanwhile, the doctor from the village hospital passes by their house and greets Anita.
Seeing the worried expression on Anita and her kids’ faces, she asks Anita what was wrong.
Anita tells the doctor about the wrath of the Goddess that has befallen on her husband.
The doctor tells Anita that she would like to see her husband.
But Anita refuses saying that she should not meet her husband.
The doctor ignores Anita and goes inside the house and then Anita follows hesitantly.
The doctor examines Ashok and informs him that he has chickenpox.
But Ashok and Anita do not know what chickenpox is.
They look questioningly at the doctor.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on bridging the Digital Divide.
Here, we will talk about chickenpox, its symptoms, causes and the Do’s and Don’ts.
Let us first see what chickenpox is.
Chickenpox is a viral infection in which one develops itchy blisters on the body.
Chickenpox vaccine works very well in preventing the disease.
Small number of people who take the vaccine may still get chickenpox.
But they usually have a milder case.
Generally, chickenpox is mild and not life-threatening.
But, sometimes it is severe and one needs to be in the hospital or can even die.
Chickenpox can affect:
pregnant women
newborn babies
teens and adults and
people who have low immune systems.
Once you have had chickenpox, generally the virus does not re-emerge.
If one gets chickenpox for a second time, it is called shingles.
Let us now see some symptoms of chickenpox:
A fever that lasts longer than 2 days
Red, warm, and sore skin
Severe itching that cannot be relieved by home treatment
Rashes that last longer than 2 weeks.
Let us now see the duration and contagiousness of chickenpox.
Chickenpox blisters form in 3-5 days and crust in 7-10 days.
It gets contagious within 1-2 days of its occurrence.
It remains contagious until all the blisters have crusted over.
It's highly contagious and can spread very easily from person to person.
Let us now see the causes of chickenpox.
You can get chickenpox by:
touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister or
if someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you.
Risk is greater:
If you have never had chickenpox before and
If you  have not taken the chickenpox vaccine either.
Now, let us see what we should do when we get chickenpox -
Consult your doctor to ensure it is chicken pox and not mosquito/insect bite.
Eat a light meal; home cooked food is advised.
Bathe in cool or lukewarm water every 3 to 4 hours for the first few days.
Add neem leaves to the water used for bathing; it reduces the itching.
Have a bath and pat the body dry.
Drink lots of water -coconut, barley or anything that is cooling.
Wash clothes  of the infected person separately to avoid spread of the infection.
If you have not had chickenpox or the vaccine, you should get vaccinated.
Let us now see what you should not do during chickenpox -
Avoid scratching the red itchy blisters,
this can lead to bacterial infections and scarring.
Avoid contact with other people because they may get infected.
This brings to the end of the tutorial. Remember, seeking medical aid is always helpful.
Thanking you for listening and STAY SAFE.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Referencing and Dereferencing in Perl.
You can use any text-editor of your choice.
You should have working knowledge of:
If not, then go through the relevant Perl tutorials on this website.
What is a Reference?
A reference is a pointer or an address to a variable, array, hash or a subroutine.
It does not contain data directly.
Reference is an easy, compact scalar value.
Reference will improve the performance of Perl code when you pass or return large data-structures.
It saves memory as it passes a reference to a subroutine rather than passing a value.
Easy to manage complicated Perl data structures.
Let us learn how to create a reference.
We can create a reference for any variable, subroutine or value, by putting a backslash (\) in front of it.
A scalar variable is referenced by backslash and dollar sign ($) as shown here.
An array variable is referenced by backslash and at the rate(@) symbol.
A hash variable is referenced by backslash and percentage(%) symbol as shown in the example here.
what is dereference?
When a reference is dereferenced, the actual value is returned.
Dereference is done by enclosing the reference variable within curly brackets
and preceding the left curly bracket with a character denoting the type of reference it is.
Let us see how to dereference variables.
A scalar variable is dereferenced by dollar sign ($) and curly brackets.
An array variable is dereferenced by at the rate (@) symbol and curly brackets.
A hash variable is dereferenced by percentage(%) symbol and curly brackets.
Let us see a simple program for Scalar reference and dereference.
Let me open a sample program in 'gedit' Text editor.
Open the terminal and type: gedit scalarRef dot pl ampersand and press Enter.
First line declares a scalar variable '$a' and initialized to 10.
As mentioned earlier, a scalar variable is referenced by backslash and dollar sign ($).
This line will print memory address of the variable that is created as reference.
To print the actual value, the variable is dereferenced by curly brackets preceded by '$'.
Here, ref() function will return the reference type such as scalar or array or hash.
Switch to the terminal and type: perl scalarRef dot pl and press Enter.
The output is displayed as shown.
First line shows the memory address where the value 10 is stored.
The second line returns the actual value 10.
Ref() function returns "SCALAR" as output.
Next, let us understand how to create a reference and dereference array by using a sample program.
In the terminal, type: gedit arrayRef dot pl ampersand and press Enter.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen, in the arrayRef dot pl file.
Here, in the first line, I have declared an array @color and initialized it with three values.
It is referenced with backslash @color which is the array name and assigned to $colorRef.
The print statement will print the reference value and the dereferenced value.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl arrayRef dot pl and press Enter.
The output is displayed as shown here.
The first line shows the output of the memory address of the variable that is created as reference.
The second line shows the actual value that is dereferenced.
Next, we will see how to declare direct reference for an array.
Let’s come back to our program.
I have changed the existing program to show the direct reference for an array.
You can create a direct reference for an array by using square brackets [] as shown.
Use arrow operator (->) to dereference.
print statement will print "Green" as output.
Here, the print statement takes the value of index[1].  i.e 'Green' in our program.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl arrayRef dot pl and press Enter to execute.
I’ll show an example on how to use the direct hash reference in the same code file.
You can create a direct reference to hash by using curly brackets {} as shown here.
Use arrow operator (->) to dereference it. “Name” is the hash key.
On executing this block of code, both the print statements will print "Sunil" as output.
Next we will see how to add, remove, access elements to array reference with a sample program.
I already have a sample program. Let me open it in gedit text-editor.
Open the terminal and type: gedit arrayRefadd dot pl ampersand and press Enter.
'arrayRefadd.pl' file is now open in gedit. Type the code as shown here, in your file.
The first line initializes an array.
We have referenced an array with backslash @numarray and assigned to $ref.
Now, we will see how to access a particular element from the array reference.
We need to use the array index in square brackets “[ ]”  to access the particular value and an arrow operator (“->”) to dereference it.
The print statement will print the value of index [0].
push() function adds elements at the last position of an array reference.
This print statement shows the output, after adding to the array reference.
pop() function removes an element from the last position of an array reference.
In our example, 7 will be removed from the existing array reference.
print statement shows the output after deleting from the array reference.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl arrayRefadd dot pl and press Enter.
The output is displayed as shown here.
Now, let us see another sample program to add, remove, and access elements of hash reference.
On the terminal, type: gedit hashRefadd dot pl ampersand  and press Enter.
This will open the file 'hashRefadd.pl' in gedit.
Let me explain the sample program.
I have declared a direct hash reference that can be stored in a scalar variable $weektemp.
I have used curly brackets to represent the hash reference and the arrow operator to dereference.
This code stores the temperature values from Monday to Friday.
I am using the “keys” built-in function to loop through the keys of the hash.
print statement will print each element of the hash.
We can access the particular value of an element as shown here.
print statement will print the temperature on Monday.
Now, save the file.
Switch to terminal and type: perl hashRefadd dot pl and press Enter to see the output.
The hash keys and hash values are stored in a random order.
The displayed output is not related to the order in which they were added.
Here is an assignment for you. Add new keys “Saturday” and “Sunday” in hash weektemp, in our hashRefadd dot pl file.
Delete key “Saturday” at the end.
Print hash weektemp.
Save and execute the program. Now check the result.

Dear Friends, Welcome to the spoken tutorial on   “Solving Nonlinear Equations using Numerical Methods”
Solve nonlinear equations using numerical methods
The methods we will be studying are
Bisection method and
Secant method
We will also develop Scilab code to solve nonlinear equations.
Ubuntu 12.04 as the operating system and
Scilab 5.3.3 version
Before practising this tutorial, a learner should have
basic knowledge of Scilab and
nonlinear equations
For Scilab, please refer to the Scilab tutorials available on the Spoken Tutorial website.
For a given function f, we have to find the value of x for which f of x is equal to zero.
This solution x  is called root of equation  or  zero of function f.
This process is called  root finding or zero finding.
We begin by studying Bisection Method.
In bisection method we calculate the initial bracket of the root.
Then we iterate through the bracket and halve its length.
We repeat this process until we find the solution of the equation.
Let us solve this function using Bisection method.
Given
function f equal to two sin x minus e to the power of x divided by four minus one in the interval minus five and minus three
Open Bisection dot sci on Scilab editor.
Let us look at the code for Bisection method.
We define the function Bisection with input arguments a b f and Tol.
Here a is the lower limit of the interval
b is the upper limit of the interval
f is the function to be solved
and Tol is the tolerance level
We specify the maximum number of iterations to be equal to hundred.
We find the midpoint of the interval and iterate till the value calculated is within the specified tolerance range.
Let us solve the problem using this code.
Save and execute the file.
Switch to Scilab console
Let us define the interval.
Let a be equal to minus five.
Let b be equal to minus three.
Define the function using deff function.
We type
deff open paranthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket equal to f of x close single quote comma open single quote y equal to two asterisk sin of x minus open paranthesis open paranthesis percentage e to the power of x close paranthesis divided by four close paranthesis minus one close single quote close paranthesis
To know more about deff function type help deff
Let tol be equal to 10 to the power of minus five.
To solve the problem, type
Bisection open paranthesis a comma b comma f comma tol close paranthesis
The root of the function is shown on the console.
Let us study Secant method.
In Secant method, the derivative is approximated by finite difference using two successive iteration values.
Let us solve this example using Secant method.
The function is f equal to x square minus six.
The two starting guesses are , p zero equal to two and p one equal to three.
Before we solve the problem, let us look at the code for Secant method.
Open Secant dot sci on Scilab editor.
We define the function secant with input arguments a, b and f.
a is first starting guess for the root
b is the second starting guess and
f is the function to be solved.
We find the difference between the value at the current point and the previous point.
We apply Secant method  and find the value of the root.
Let me save and execute the code.
Type clc.
Press Enter
Let me define the initial guesses for this example.
Type  a equal to 2
Then type  b equal to 3
Press  Enter.
We define the function using deff function.
Type deff open paranthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket equal to g of x close single quote comma open single quote y equal to open paranthesis x to the power of two close paranthesis minus six close single quote close paranthesis
Press Enter
Secant open paranthesis a comma b comma g close paranthesis.
Press Enter
The value of the root is shown on the console
Let us summarize this tutorial.
Develop Scilab code for different solving methods
Find the roots of nonlinear equation
Solve this problem on your own using the two methods we learnt today.

This is the default program environment with two empty functions -void setup and void loop.
Now, we will write an Arduino program to blink the LED.
I have placed my IDE and the Arduino board side by side.
This will help us to see the execution of the program and the output in the board.
For this LED program, I want to blink pin number 13.
It is a digital input/output pin connected to this LED internally.
Notice the highlight with the marker.
Now, we have to write our code.
void setup function stands for setting up a microcontroller.
In our case, pin number 13 has to be set up first.
To do this, we will use an in-built function called pinMode.
It has two parameters - pin number comma mode.
So, type: pinMode open brackets 13 comma output close brackets semicolon.
Why should we keep the mode as output?
This is because the pin number 13 is internally connected to the LED.
It will glow when the voltage is high but it will not glow when the voltage is zero.
We have to configure mode as ‘output’ to serve voltage to the LED.
Next we will write code to the void loop function.
Before we blink a LED, let us glow a LED.
There is a function called digitalWrite which will write to a digital pin.
This function has two parameters as pin number and value or state.
Already, we know the pin number as 13. The value should be HIGH or LOW.
So, type: digitalWrite open brackets 13 comma HIGH close brackets semicolon.
We want to glow the LED. So, the voltage should be HIGH.
That's all. The code is very simple.
Next step is to compile the program.
Click on the Tick icon on the menu bar to verify the program.
This will compile our program into binary format which is understandable by the microcontroller.
You can see the compilation status at the bottom of the IDE.
Next we need to upload the program to the microcontroller.
Click on Right arrow button on the menu bar to upload.
You can see the TX RX blinks for a while. This indicates the transmission is ON.
Now you can see the LED is glowing.
How to turn off the LED?
Now, let us compile and upload this program.
You can see the LED is off now.
We know how to turn ON and OFF the LED.
Next, we will modify the program to make the LED to blink,
that is, ON and OFF, with one second interval.
We will change the program as shown. Delay is a built-in function which pauses the program for certain amount of time.
I will type: delay open brackets  500 close brackets semicolon.
Next, type as digitalWrite open brackets 13 comma LOW close brackets semicolon.
This makes the digital pin 13 to OFF mode.
How long we want to turn it OFF?
Again, we want to OFF it for 500 milliseconds.
Let me explain the Void loop program line by line again.
Void loop is an infinite loop and it will execute continuously.
The pin number 13 connected to the LED will be in HIGH state for 500 milliseconds. And then, in the LOW state for 500 milliseconds.
This program is executed repeatedly in the loop.
Let us upload the program.
We can see our LED is blinking.
In this tutorial, we learnt about:  how to write an Arduino program,
Compile and upload the program and  blink an LED.
Do the following assignment.  Change the delay timing to 1500 in the above Blink LED program.
Compile and upload the program and observe the blinking in the LED.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Formulae and Functions in Calc.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
Conditional Operators,
If..Or statement
Basic statistical functions and  Rounding off numbers
This tutorial is recorded using  Ubuntu Linux OS version 18.04 and LibreOffice Suite version 6.3.5
Earlier in the series, we learnt to use basic arithmetic operators and average function
Now we shall learn about conditional operators.
Conditional operators,
Show results in boolean: TRUE or FALSE.
Let’s open Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods.
This file has been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Please download and extract the file.  Make its copy and use it for practising.
Here, under the column Cost, we have listed the prices of several items.
Let’s apply conditional operators on them and analyse the results.
Note that the amount for House Rent is rupees 6',000.
The cost for Electricity Bill is rupees 800.
The amount for House Rent is more than the Electricity Bill.
Click on cell B10.
The result of the condition will be applied and displayed in this cell.
In this cell, type the first condition as is equal to C3 greater than C4.
Now let us change this conditional statement to is equal to C3 lesser than C4.
The result we get is FALSE this time.
Likewise, we can type some other conditions and study the results.
We can also use the If and Or condition on our data
To print the results according to the condition that holds TRUE.
Click on cell B10.
Type is equal to IF and within brackets, C3 greater than C4 comma, within double quotes Positive comma and again within double quotes Negative.
The if condition checks whether the value in cell C3 is greater than the value in cell C4.
Accordingly, Positive or Negative will be displayed.
Notice that the result is Positive since rupees 6000 is greater than rupees 800.
Now, in the condition statement let’s change greater than to less than.
We got the output as expected.
You can also see the change in result, if we change the data in the cells C3 and C4.
Now, let us increase the value in cell C4 to 8000 and press the Enter key.
The result automatically changes to Positive.
The result again automatically changes to Negative.
Next, let’s learn a few basic and statistical functions.
The syntax to write a formula with a function is:
Equals to  =
Common basic functions include-
SUM for addition,
PRODUCT for multiplication,
QUOTIENT for division
Now let me demonstrate how the Sum, Product and the Quotient functions work.
Type the numbers 50, 100 and 150 within cells B1, B2 and B3 respectively.
Click on cell A5 and type the text SUM.
Click on cell B5.
If we know the function and the syntax, we can directly type it in the respective cell as shown.
Type is equal to SUM, and within the braces, B1 colon B3.  And press Enter on the keyboard.
If we don't know the function name, we can make use of the Functions section.
Click on the fx icon in the sidebar.
The Functions Wizard opens.
From the functions drop-down, select Mathematical.
The list of all mathematical functions available in Calc will be displayed below.
Scroll down and double-click on the function SUM.
At the bottom, we can see information about the selected function.
Notice the cell B5.
The syntax for the selected function is inserted in the cell.
Select the cells B1 to B3 as shown, with the cursor.
Look at the Input Line. The formula is auto-completed.
Now press the Enter key on the keyboard.
Next, let’s click on cell A6 and type PRODUCT.
Click on cell B6.
From the Functions Wizard, scroll and double-click on the function PRODUCT.
Select the cells B1 to B3 as shown, with the cursor.
Notice the result shows 7,50,000.
If you wish to select only specific cells, then select those cells by holding the Ctrl key.
Double-click on the function PRODUCT.
Select the cells B1 and B3 as shown, with the cursor while pressing the Ctrl key.
The new result 7,500 is seen.
Next, let’s see how Quotient works.
Click on cell A7 and type QUOTIENT.
Now click on cell B7.
Type is equal to QUOTIENT, and within the braces, B2 comma B1.
We will get the result as 2 because 100 divided by 50 is 2.
Let’s change the number in cell B2 to 151 now.
Notice the change in cell B7. The quotient is 3 but the remainder 1 is lost.
What if we want to see the remainder?
Click on cell B8 and type is equal to MOD, and within the braces, B2 comma B1.
Explore the other functions available in the Functions Wizard later on your own.
Next, let’s learn how to implement statistical functions.
Statistical functions are useful for analysis of data in spreadsheets.
For example, statistical functions like COUNT, MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, MODE
Let us go to Sheet 1.
Let’s see how to find the minimum, maximum and the median costs.
This we will do using Calc’s statistical functions.
Under the column Cost, we have very few entries.
These are the results which should be displayed when we use the functions.
Let’s click on the cell C10 where we will be displaying the result.
Click on the Format as Number icon in the Formatting toolbar
This applies the numbering format to the selected cell.
Now go to the Formula bar and select the Autosum icon.
From the list select the option MIN.
Select the cells C3 to C7 as shown, with the cursor.
Now the result is 300, which is the minimum value.
Likewise do for the Maximum function.
Now the result is 6000 which is the maximum value.
To find the median value, in the Input Line replace the term MAX with MEDIAN.
The result shows 800, which is the median cost in this column.
Now, let’s find the count of all entries in this column.
In the Input Line replace the term MEDIAN with COUNT.
The result is shown as 5 which is the total number of entries in this column.
Now, let’s find the count of all entries in this column which are greater than 1000.
In the Input Line replace the term COUNT with COUNTIF.
After the range type comma space within double quotes greater than 1000.
The result is shown as 2 which is the total number of entries greater than 1000.
Explore other statistical functions and analyze them on your own later.
Let us now delete the changes in cell C10.
Next, let’s learn how to round off numbers.
Let us make a few changes under the column Cost.
We shall change: 6000 to 6000.34, 600 to 600.4, 300 to 300.3.
Notice that the sum total is 9701.04.
Now suppose we don’t want any decimal places in our result.
The best solution is to round off the number to the nearest whole number.
Let us click on the cell C10.
Type is equal to ROUND, open bracket SUM and again within brackets C3 colon C7 and close the bracket.
You see, that the result is now 9701.
The value 9701.04 is rounded off to the nearest whole number.
Rounding off, can be done to either the lower whole number or the higher number.
Let’s click on the cell with the result and edit the term ROUND to ROUNDUP.
To round off to the lower whole number, change the term ROUNDUP to ROUNDDOWN.
This time the result is 9701 which is the lower whole number.
There are many other functions available in the Functions Wizard library of Calc.
Let us close the file without saving the changes.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial, let us summarize.
As an assignment
With the salary data try out MIN, MAX and MEDIAN functions
Try round off function with the same salary data

Hi. In this tutorial I'll show you how to create a simple php upload script.
This will be slightly more advanced in our 'upload dot php' file.
We will use our 'index dot php'. We will be mainly using html code to give a form to the user to submit this particular file.
Then in 'upload dot php', we will process this file, get some information about the file like its name, its type, size, temporary stored name and any error messages that have occurred.
You can use the error messages to check if it has occurred or hasn't occurred.
Then we are going to process the file and save it in a specific directory on our web-server.
In the second part of this tutorial, I'll quickly teach you how to check the specific file type so you can protect it against file types.
We will also learn how to check the file size of the file so you can have a maximum or minimum file size.
So, here I've created a folder named 'uploaded' in which I've created my 'index' and 'upload dot php' files.
And this is where my files are being stored once they have been uploaded.
When the files are uploaded initially, they go into a temporary area on the web server and not into this folder.
For the html - we need to create a form. To do this, we have a form action and we have a  specific action which is 'upload dot php' and we've created our file here.
The method is set to POST. The reason for this is that we don't need to store it in a GET variable.
Why? Because we don't want the user to see the binary data we're sending across the website, for security reasons.
And also there is a hundred character limit on our GET variable.
So, you’ll have a very small file if you have only hundred bits of data.
Okay, we have another parameter which you may not have heard of before.
It's enctype, encoding type which means how we are going to encode this.
It will be multi-part and we need a forward slash and then its form-data.
In short, this means that we're submitting this form in the form of data - that is, binary data - zeroes and ones which I mentioned earlier over here.
Okay, so we've got the type this is going to be encoded to. We'll end our form here.
We'll need some elements inside as input for our file.
This type is set to 'file' and we'll call it 'myfile', to be specific.
Okay - paragraph break here and then all we need is a submit button.
Okay, so let's just preview this. Let's close this off.
Click fileupload. Oh - let's go back.  Input - I typed 2 'u's here.
Let's go back. You can see here we got our input here.
I can make it Browse. We can see we got a selection of files which we can upload.
Okay - so let's make it more user friendly for you and me.
"Upload a file". And let's refresh that.  Okay, so we've got a nice page here.
We've got our header and possibility to upload a file here. Also can be manually typed in here, if needed.
And also we have an Upload button which submits to our 'upload dot php'.
Fine. So, inside 'upload dot php' we need a way of processing this file which has been submitted from our form.
The way to do this is by using 'dollar underscore FILES'. This isn't actually right.
We can tell it isn't right by echoing out just a single instance of this.
When we do and I click on Upload, we can see we just get "Array". That's because this is an array.
Since this is a multidimensional array, in the first set of brackets we'll type the name of the file that we have uploaded and the name of the input box from which it came from - that is 'myfile'.
So, we'll use "myfile" here.  And in the second one, we can have a variety of properties and the simplest and most easy one to think about is the name of the file.
So, let's go back to the 'upload form' and let's choose 'intro dot avi'.  It will be displayed here.
Let's click Upload and on the next page we see 'intro dot avi'.
Remember this is in our 'upload dot php' form, file.. sorry.
Okay. so that's that. Let me just save this to a variable.
The next one we'll look at is - I'll just type it here - is the type of file.
So, this is 'dollar underscore FILES' and we'll use the "myname" reference.
And inside here, we'll have the type.  So that's type or rather we'll echo this out so you can see.
And it's refresh. Re-send that and see that now - "myfile".
Right, re-send that and we can see there's a 'video slash avi'.  You may have seen this somewhere before in html.
For example - this can be 'image slash png' or 'image slash jpeg', 'image slash bmp' , 'video slash avi' and 'video slash mpeg' or some other format.
At the moment we can see from here that it is an 'avi' file, so therefore that's what we get in "type".
So, we can say $type equals all of this.
The next one I'll show you is the size.  So to save time what I'll do is - I'll copy this code, paste it here and change this "type" to "size" and echo it out.
You can see it's quite simple to get e-property of the file you submit.
I'll refresh this page and click Resend and we can get the size of the file.
Now, let's say we round this off to about a million - a million bytes is in fact a....,
sorry, a million bits is a megabyte. "myfile" is actually a mega byte.
So, we've got a million megabyte of data here.
So, let's save that in a variable called $size. Ok?
Right then, the next one which is quite an important one is the 'temporary name'.
This is written slightly differently as "tmp", abbreviated to 'temp' and underscore and "name".
This will give us the directory that it's stored in temporarily until we transfer it to the folder of our choice.
So, let's refresh this page.
Click on Resend and you can see that that's stored into an xampp because I'm using this application.
But if you're using an apache, you can store php yourself.
You'll have apache here followed by your temporary file name.
You can see that this is a randomly generated name that has a "tmp" extension.
But it is useless to us at the moment.
So we can save that as '$temp file' or '$temp'.  Let's type 'temp' in order to keep it short.
And the last one is 'error'. Now this will basically echo out a zero if everything is clear.
Again, copy-paste and change that to "error".
We should get zero at the moment because everything is written correctly.
And this will never be a negative value.
If it's more than zero it means that it's giving an error code which basically means that you have an error.
And let's say, we'll store this in a variable called $error.
Okay. that's all for now.  In the second part of this tutorial, I'll show you how to upload your file by moving it from the temporary storage area to a specified area of your choice.
And what we'll do is we'll use this variable '$error' to see if there are any errors.
If there are errors, then we'll echo it out and use the error code.
If not, we'll take this $temp and we'll use a specific function called 'move uploaded' file and we'll take that and store it in our uploaded directory, created on my web-server here.
And then after that I'll take you through some specifics to say - is this a jpeg? Yes, then disallow 'jpeg' image being uploaded or disallow specific file size.
Okay so tune in to Part-2. Thanks for watching. This is Joshua Mathew, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.
Welcome to this brief tutorial on creating references using LaTeX and BibTeX.
What you first need to do is to create a database of references as in this file 'ref.bib'.
Let’s go down this file and let's go back to the top.
Each of these references begins with a unique key word. For example, the key word for this reference is KMM07.
In the LaTeX file, let me open the LaTeX file, at the place where you want to use a reference, give the command 'cite key word'.
For example- cite key word, cite keyword, Look at this, cite KMM07, the first reference we saw in 'ref.bib'.
The next thing you have to do is to include the name of the file that has the references in the source file.
Here, I have included it towards the end of this document – 'bibliography ref'. Recall that the references are in the file 'ref.bib'.
Finally, you have to say what bibliography style is to be used.
That is included at the top of this source file.
This command 'bibliography style plain'.
Suppose that we use plain style here, the following sequence of commands is to be executed to create the references in the plain style.
First, compile the source file using 'pdf LaTeX references'.
Execute the command BibTeX references.
Third one, compile the source file, twice more, using pdf LaTeX references.
Once. Twice.
The references are now created, let’s go and see.
The second page, here is the text, here is the list of references. Let’s just go down.
The plain style lists the references in alphabetical order and with numbering.
These numbers are used in the main text as well.
The referencing style 'u-n-s-r-t' is identical to the plain style but for one difference.
Put 'u-n-s-r-t' here.
References are listed in the order they are invoked first.
Let us change the plain to 'u-n-s-r-t', like the way we have done and then repeat the procedure of LaTeXing and BibTeXing. Which is, first, LaTeX the source file using pdf LaTeX, then BibTeX the source file using BibTeX and then LaTeX the source file twice more. First time, second time.
Note what has happened now.
You can see that this has generated the references in the order they are cited in the paper. For example, this first reference is cited first here.
Reference two is cited ‘2’ because it has been cited here.
It has been listed as second in this list.
Let’s just go down this list.
Okay. Let's come back.
To produce the references in the way the computer scientists use, change the style to 'alpha'.
Let’s change this to 'alpha'.
Save and then repeat the LaTeXing and BibTeXing procedure. Which is, pdf LaTeX source file, BibTeX references, pdf LaTeX references once, twice. Note that.
Now, we obtain this style of referencing.
Let’s just go down this and see.
Okay.
There are many other styles of referencing. I have now downloaded two files: 'Harvard.sty' and 'ifac.bst'.
Make the following two changes. First, include 'Harvard' in the use packages command
like I do now and then change the style to 'ifac'.
Save the file.
Now, let’s do the LaTeXing and BibTeXing procedure once again.
Latex, BibTeX, LaTeX once, LaTeX twice.
We get the reference list as this pdf file.
Let’s just go down once.
It is alphabetically arranged but there are no serial numbers compared to the plain style.
The referencing is by author name and year; author name... and year.
In this style, there is a special command called cite-as-noun. That helps, put the name of the person cited in running text and not within brackets.
Note that here we have used only cite and we have got all the references within brackets only.
Suppose for example,
look at this second paragraph.. The textbook by 'cite KMM07'. The textbook by.. the whole thing comes within the brackets. Suppose, I change this to 'cite-as-noun'.
Save it and compile it.
As a result, now, this Moudgalya has come outside the bracket in running text.
If you need some other referencing style, search the web.
There are good chances that someone has already written the required 'sty' and 'bst' files.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Thank you for joining. This is Kannan Moudgalya, signing off. Good-bye.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Overview and Installation of Git.
For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection.
You should also have either Ubuntu Linux or Windows operating system.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with either of the mentioned operating systems.
First, let us learn what is VCS i.e Version Control System.
Version Control System is like a backup system.
It manages the changes in documents, computer programs and web sites.
It provides a historical record of what you have done over time.
VCS is also known as revision control, source control and Source Code Management (SCM).
Some examples of VCS are RCS, Subversion and Bazaar.
Next, let us start with Git.
Git is a distributed version control software.
It is a free and open source software.
It keeps track of changes made to a file or set of files.
It allows developers to work collaboratively.
It manages and stores versions of projects.
It helps in tracking the project progress history.
The salient features of Git are as follows:
We can go back and recover previous versions of our work.
We can see the complete history of all the changes.
Conflicts can be easily resolved using the suggestions given by Git.
If there is loss of data, it can be restored from any of the client repositories.
Git can be used by: * programmers, web developers, project managers, writers and many others.
Anyone working with text files, sheets, design files, drawings etc. to track versions.
People who work collaboratively on an activity or project.
Now, let's see how Git works.
Git actually stores a snapshot of entire project.
Snapshot is similar to taking a picture of all the files at that moment.
If some files have no changes, Git doesn’t store them again.
It links them to the previous version.
In the event of failure, the data is restored from the snapshot.
Let me show glimpses of some features covered in this series-
Basic commands of Git
The git checkout command
Inspection and comparison of Git and
Tagging in Git.
In this series, we will also learn about:
Git can be installed on Ubuntu Linux using Ubuntu Software Center.
For more details on Ubuntu Software Center, refer to the "Linux" tutorials on this website.
I have already completed the installation of Git on my system. Now, let us verify this.
Go to the terminal and type: git space hyphen hyphen version and press Enter.
We can see the version number of Git displayed.
This means that Git is installed successfully.
Next, let us learn to install Git on Windows OS.
Open your web browser and go to www.git-scm.com.
Click on the Downloads link, on the left side.
Click on Windows icon to download Git for Windows.
The Save As dialog-box appears. Click on Save File button.
The installer file will be downloaded in the default Downloads folder.
Double-click on the "exe" file to install Git.
In the dialog-box that appears, click on Run and then on Yes.
Now, click on Next. In the "General Public License" page, click on Next.
By default, Git is installed in Program Files. Click on Next.
We can select the components to install.
Click on the Additional icons checkbox.
Then click on Next. Again click on Next.
Here, you can select the option to run the Git commands.
I will select Use Git Bash only and click on Next.
I keep this option as default and click on Next.
Git is installing. This may take few minutes depending on your internet speed.
Click on Finish button to complete the installation.
Now, the Git Release Notes opens up automatically. Let me close it.
You will see a short-cut icon Git Bash, created on the Desktop. Double-click on it to open.
Alternately, you can click on 'Start' menu >> All programs >> Git and then click on Git Bash.
Now Git Bash will open.
It shows the installed version number of Git.
So, we know that Git is installed successfully.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Data types and operators.
and Operators in Python like
To practise this tutorial,
There are three built-in data types in Python to represent numbers.
Let's first see about int.  Type a is equal to 13
Type a Now, we have our first int variable a.
To see the type of a, type, type inside parentheses a.This means that a is of integer data type.
There are some functions associated with the int data type to manipulate it.
These can be explored by typing a dot and then press the tab key. Here you can see the list of functions.
int data type can hold integers of any size.
Let us see an example. Type b is equal to 20 times 9 Here we are storing 9, repeated 20 times in b.
Type type inside parentheses b We can see that type of b is integer.
Next we will see about float data type.  Type p is equal to 3.141592
Type type inside parentheses p We can see that type of p is float.
The last data type in the list is complex number. Type c is equal to 3.2 plus 4.6j
It is just a combination of two floats.  The imaginary part being defined by j notation instead of i.
Complex numbers have a lot of functions specific to them.  Type c dot and then press the tab key.
Let us try some of them. Type c dot real
Type c dot imag
c dot real gives the real part and c dot imag gives the imaginary part of the complex number.
We can get the absolute value of c by typing, abs inside parentheses c
Python also has Boolean as a built-in type. To try it out, just type, t is equal to True, T in capital
Now you can apply different Boolean operations on t. For example, type f is equal to not t
To see the value of f, type f
Type f or t. The output is True.
Type f and t. The output is False.
What if you want to apply one operator before another?
We can use parentheses for precedence. Let us write a small code to check this out.
Type, b is equal to True
Type, c is equal to True
Now we will check how precedence changes with parenthesis.
Let us try two expressions and their evaluations.
Type, inside parentheses a and b or c
This expression gives the value True.
Now type a and inside parentheses b or c  It gives the value False.
Let's now look at some operators available in Python3.
Python uses plus sign for addition.  Type, 23 plus 74
Minus sign for subtraction.Type, 23 minus 56
Asterisk sign for multiplication. Type, 45 asterisk 76
slash sign for division. Type, 384 slash 16
Let us move ahead with operators.
Percentage sign for modulo operation. Modulo operator gives reminder value.
Type, 87 percentage sign 6
Two asterisks for an exponent. Type, 7 asterisk asterisk 8
In case, we may want to use the current value of variable in which the result is stored in the expression.
We can do that by putting the operator before equal to.
Let us say, a is equal to 73
Type, a asterisk equal to 34  To see the value of a, type, a
Again we will assign the same value to a by typing, a is equal to 73
Type, a is equal to a asterisk 34.
Type a You can see that both the expressions are giving the same value.
Pause the video. Try this exercise and then resume the video. Find the square root of 3 using Python.
The solution is on your screen. 3 asterisk asterisk 0.5 gives the square root of 3.
Will you get the same value for the below expressions?
Switch to the terminal for the solution.
Type, 3 asterisk asterisk 0.5. This operation gives a float.
Type, 3 asterisk asterisk 1/2 This operation also gives a float, but different value.
To get the same value, type, 3 asterisk asterisk inside parentheses 1/2
In this tutorial, we have learnt about,
Operators in Python like
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
2.**Two asterisks are used to find exponent.

Hello Friends! Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Finance options for Biogas plant.
Earlier, we learnt about biogas and the benefits of having a biogas plant.
In this tutorial, we will learn:how to apply for a loan to get a biogas plant built
Fact that one can either self-finance or avail bank loan to build the biogas plant
pre-requisites required to avail the loan
List of documents to be attached with loan application form-
Cost factors for building the plant
Approximate break-up of the budget
And subsidies provided by the government of India to build a biogas plant.
Before we begin, it should be known that we can either self-finance or avail bank loan to build the biogas plant.
One should be also aware about the budget for building a biogas plant.
The approximate cost for building the biogas plant is from Rs 20,000 to Rs 23,000/-.
The first step to get a biogas plant built is - visiting Khadi and Village Industries Commission office of the respective district.
This office is also known as KVIC.
Each KVIC has a Rural Energy Technical department.
Meet the Rural Energy Technician i.e.RET in the mentioned department.
Request the RET to make a visit to the proposed biogas plant site.
Next, the RET will visit and inspect the prerequisite(s) required to avail the loan.
List of pre-requisite(s) to avail the loan is as follows:
Availability of land. For e.g. 12 feet by 16 feet land is required for building 12 feet by 8 feet of biogas plant.
Adequate supply of water for daily feeding of the biogas plant.
Approximate quantity of  solid waste either in the form of cow-dung and /or the bio-degradable waste.
Please note, quantity of waste for the plant is directly proportional to the size of the plant.
For example, 25 kgs of solid waste and 25 litres of water are required for a 12 feet x 8 feet of biogas plant.
The RET will also check the number and age of cattle.
For example,  minimum 2 cows producing an average of 12 kg dung are required for a 2 cubic meter biogas plant.
This check is to ensure supply of 25 kgs of dung to the biogas plant.
Lastly, the RET will check the bank account/loan account of the applicant.
If all the prerequisites are met, then the RET issues a technical feasibility certificate.
Once the technical feasibility certificate is issued, visit the nearest bank to avail the loan.
You may visit banks such as private banks like IDBI bank, Canara bank, Union bank of India.
Co-operative banks like  Saraswat bank,  Dombivli nagari sahakari bank, South canara district central cooperative bank (known as SCDCC),
Gramin bank of different states, and Development credit bank (Known as DCB) etc.
So, what is the amount of loan one can get from the bank?
You will be surprised to know that you can avail 100% of loan from a bank.
However, it is to be noted that the following will vary from bank to bank-
Loan amount, sanction period , interest of loan and loan repayment.
Loan formalities start with filling up of the forms such as the loan application form.
The RET officer will help you in filling the form.
As shown- the following details have to be filled in the application form-
purpose of applying for the loan,
name and address of the applicant,
resident of the respective village since year,
nature of activity,
age and gender,
category-SC/ST/OBC and  other such details.
I will now fill in the details as required in the form.
The filled form would look like this.
Along with the loan application form, the other documents to be attached are -
Technical feasibility certificate
Document of land holding
Photocopy of Ration card and proof of annual income.
After filling the form, we have to submit it to the bank officer for scrutiny.
We will receive the Branch Manager or inspecting officer’s reference and loan approval.
Let's now talk about the cost factors for building the plant.
The cost for building the plant depends upon factors such as cost of raw material, mason's charges and transportation cost from the hardware shop to the plant site.
The raw material and transportation cost along with the mason's charges may vary from region to region.
The approximate break-up of budget is as follows:
Approximately Rs.4,000/- for the mason and his laborers
Approximately Rs.1,300/- for the biogas burner stove
Approximately Rs. 15,000/- for the raw material
Approximately Rs. 2000/- as transportation charges from the hardware shop to the plant site.
A good news for all those who plan to build a biogas plant is that- Government of India provides subsidies to build a biogas plant.
The subsidies provided to applicants are: Rs 9,000/- for general category,  Rs 11,000/- for SC/ST category and  Rs 17,000/- for North-Eastern States.
An extra subsidy of Rs 1,200/- is given if toilet is attached to the biogas plant.
To avail the subsidy, we need to fill a form after the biogas plant is built.
This form is available with the local Gram Panchayat office.
I will now fill in the details as required in the form.
The filled subsidy form will look like this.
Please note that subsidy will be granted only after sufficient proof for the biogas plant is given such as:
technical feasibility certificate of the biogas plant and
photo of the applicant with the biogas plant.
Apart from banks, farmer groups also help financially for building a biogas plant.
Refer the given link for offices located in different states of the country.

Welcome to this tutorial on Introduction to Biopython.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: * important features of Biopython
* Information regarding download and installation on Linux Operating System
* And translation of a DNA sequence to a protein sequence using Biopython tools.
undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu OS version 12.04
* Python version 2.7.3
* Ipython version 0.12.1 and
* Biopython version 1.58.
Biopython is a collection of modules for computational biology.
It can perform most basic to advanced tasks required for bioinformatics.
Biopython tools are used for:
* Parsing, that is extracting information from various file formats such as FASTA, Genbank etc.
* Download data from database websites such as NCBI, ExPASY etc.
* Run Bioinformatic algorithms such as BLAST.
It has tools for performing common operations on sequences.
For example- to obtain complements, transcription, translation etc.
Code for dealing with alignments
and code to split up tasks into separate processes.
Information regarding download:
Biopython package is not part of the Python distribution; it needs to be downloaded independently.
For details, refer to the following link.
Installation on Linux system:
Install Python, Ipython and Biopython packages using Synaptic Package Manager.
Prerequisite software will be installed automatically.
Additional packages must be installed for graphic outputs and plots.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously.
I have already installed Python, Ipython and Biopython on my system.
Start Ipython interpreter by typing "ipython" and press Enter.
IPython prompt appears on screen.
To check the installation of Biopython- at the prompt, type: "import Bio",  press Enter.
If you don't get any error message, it means Biopython is installed.
Here, let me remind you, Python language is case sensitive.
Take precaution while typing keywords, variables or functions.
For instance, in the above line “i” in import is lowercase and “B” is uppercase in Bio.
In this tutorial, we will make use of Biopython modules to translate a DNA sequence.
It involves the following steps.
First, create a sequence object for coding DNA strand.
Next, transcription of coding DNA strand to mRNA.
Finally, translation of mRNA to a protein sequence.
We will be using the coding DNA strand shown on this slide, as an example.
It codes for a small protein sequence.
The first step is to create a sequence object for the above coding DNA strand.
Let us go back to the terminal.
For creating a sequence object, import the Seq module from Bio package.
The Seq module provides methods to store and process sequence objects.
At the prompt, type: from Bio dot Seq import Seq  press Enter.
Next, specify the alphabets in the strand explicitly, when creating your sequence object.
That is to specify whether the sequence of alphabets code for nucleotides or amino acids.
To do so, we will use IUPAC module from Alphabet package.
At the prompt, type: from Bio dot Alphabet import IUPAC.  Press Enter.
Note that we have used import and from statements to load "Seq" and "IUPAC" modules.
Store the sequence object in a variable called cdna.
At the prompt, type: cdna equal to Seq as in normal strings.
Enclose the sequence within double quotes and parentheses.
We know our sequence is a DNA fragment. So, type: unambiguous DNA alphabet object as an argument.
For the output, type: cdna. Press Enter.
The output shows the DNA sequence as a sequence object.
Let’s transcribe the coding DNA strand into the corresponding mRNA.
We will use the Seq module's built-in “transcribe” method.
Type the following code:
Store the output in a variable mrna.
At the prompt, type: mrna equal to cdna dot transcribe open and close parentheses, press Enter.
For the output, type:  mrna. Press Enter.
Observe the output.The transcribe method replaces the Thiamin in the DNA sequence by Uracil.
Next, to translate this mRNA to corresponding protein sequence, use the translate method.
Type the following code:  protein equal to mrna dot translate open and close parentheses. Press Enter.
The translate method translates RNA or DNA sequence using the standard genetic code, if unspecified.
The output shows an amino acid sequence.
The output also shows information  regarding the presence of stop codons in the translated sequence.
Observe the asterisk at the end of the protein sequence. It indicates the stop codon.
In the above code, we have used a coding DNA strand for transcription.
In Biopython, transcribe method works only on coding DNA strand.
However, in real biological systems, the process of transcription starts with a template strand.
If you are starting with a template strand, convert it to coding strand by using reverse complement method, as shown on the terminal.
Follow the rest of the code as shown above, for the coding strand.
Using methods in Biopython we have translated a DNA sequence to a protein sequence.
DNA sequence of any size can be translated to a protein sequence using this code.
Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt:
Important features of Biopython
Information regarding download and installation on Linux OS
Create a sequence object for the given DNA strand.
Transcription of the DNA sequence to mRNA.
Translation of mRNA to protein sequence.
Now, for the assignment-
Translate the given DNA sequence into protein sequence.
The protein sequence has an internal stop codon.
As it happens in nature, translate the DNA till first in-frame stop codon.
Your completed assignment should have the following code.
Notice that we have used to underscore stop argument in the translate() method. Notice the output.
The stop codon itself is not translated.
The stop symbol is not included at the end of your protein sequence.
We can try that now.
So, let us summarize.

Now we can view the point features located in different States.
Open attribute table for Admin layer.
The attribute table shows information related to states.
Minimize the Admin attribute table.
Now we will join the attributes by location for Stations layer and Admin layer.
Close both the attribute tables.
Click on Vector menu.
Scroll down the menu and click on Data Management Tools.
From the sub-menu select Join attributes by location.
Join attributes by location dialog box opens.
Click on the drop-down for Target vector layer.
Here we need to specify the target vector layer for joining the attribute table.
In our case we need to add new data to the Stations layer.
Hence Stations layer is the Target Layer.
So we will select Stations [EPSG: 4326] from the drop-down as target layer.
Click on the drop-down for Join vector layer.
Here we have to select the layer which we want to join with the target layer.
Select Admin [EPSG: 4326] from the drop-down.
Here we have several options for joining the attributes.
We are interested to find the meteorological stations located in various states.
So under Geometric predicate, we will select within check-box.
Check the check-box for Open output file after running algorithm.
Leave the rest of the settings as default.
Status bar at the bottom shows the progress of the processing algorithm.
On the canvas, a new layer, Joined layer is added in the Layers Panel.
Right-click on the Joined layer and open attribute table.
This table contains all the attributes from Admin layer for each point on the Stations layer.
Every point feature has information about the state.
Close the attribute table.
To save the project, click on Project menu from the menu bar.
Give an appropriate name and select a convenient location.
In this tutorial we have learnt to join the attribute tables of two data-sets having,
Use Rainfall.csv and Stations.shp files given in the Code files folder.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Simulating a Plug Flow Reactor(PFR) in DWSIM.
In this tutorial, we will learn to:  Define a kinetic reaction
Simulate a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR)
Calculate Conversion and Residence time for a reaction in a PFR.
To record this tutorial, I am using  DWSIM 4.3 and  Windows 7
The process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS also, such as- Linux, Mac OS X or FOSSEE OS on ARM.
To practice this tutorial, you should know :  how to add components to a flowsheet
How to select thermodynamic packages
How to add material and energy streams and specify their properties.
The prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website
We will develop a flowsheet to determine the exit composition from an Isothermal PFR.
Here we give reaction, property package and inlet stream conditions.
Next, we give Reactor Parameters and reaction kinetics.
At the bottom, click on Next.
First, we will add the compounds.
In the Compounds Search tab, type Nitrogen.
Select Nitrogen from ChemSep database.
Similarly, add Hydrogen from ChemSep database.
Next, add Ammonia from ChemSep database. Now, all the compounds are added.

Under Include, check all the check boxes against all the components’ names.
Fourth column is BC. It indicates the base component of the reaction.
Under BC, check the Nitrogen check box as Nitrogen is the base component.
Next column is Stoich. Coeff. (stoichiometric coefficients)
Under Stoic Coeff column, enter:
Negative sign is to indicate the components as Reactants.
So the reaction is balanced after entering the stoichiometric coefficients.
Here the Equation field shows the reaction equation.
Next column is DO, which indicates direct/forward reaction order.
We are considering the reaction to be First order with respect to Nitrogen.
So we will enter 1 in the DO column against Nitrogen. And then press Enter.
Next column is RO which indicates reverse reaction order.
Then comes Kinetic Reactions Parameters.
Select Fase as Vapor.
Next is Tmin and Tmax.
It gives temperature range within which rate expression is assumed to be valid.
So, enter Tmin (K) as 500 and Tmax (K) as 2000.
Now go to Direct and Reverse Reactions Velocity Constant.
In Direct Reaction, enter A as 0.004
Click OK and close the Chemical Reactions Manager window.
Now let us insert a Plug-Flow Reactor (PFR) into the flowsheet.
Under Unit Operations, click on Plug-Flow Reactor (PFR). Click on it and drag it to the flowsheet.
We will insert one Output Stream. To do so, drag one Material Stream.
Let us once again arrange it. As this is an output stream, we will leave it unspecified.
Next, we will insert one Energy Stream.  And name this stream as Energy.
We are now ready to specify the Plug-Flow Reactor. Click on it.
On the left, we can see a tab displaying properties related to the PFR.
This tab is called Property Editor Window.
Under Connections, click on the drop-down against Inlet Stream.  and select Feed.
Next, click on the drop-down against Outlet Stream and select Product.
Since we have only one reaction, we leave it as it is.
Next, click on the drop-down against Calculation Mode. Select Isothermic.
Then click on the field against Reactor Volume and enter 1 meter cube
Click on the field against Reactor length and enter it as 1.5 m.
So, from the toolbar click on Solve Flowsheet button.
When the calculations are completed, click on PFR in the Flowsheet.
From the Property Editor Window of PFR locate Results section.
Under General tab, check Residence time. It is 0.013 hour.
Under Conversions tab, check conversion for both the reacting compounds.
For Nitrogen, the conversion is 17.91% and for Hydrogen, it is 53.73%.
Now we will check the material balances.
Double click on the Master Property Table to edit it.
Configure Master Property Table window opens.
Enter Name as Results - Plug Flow Reactor
Enter Object Type as Material Stream.
By default, Material Stream is already selected. So we will not change it.

Hello Everyone! In the previous tutorial, we had selected the data and we successfully displayed the data to our page.
Let me take you back to this page here. We can see that everything is working fine.
We have all our data here.
The next thing we will learn is how to specify somewhere that the users themselves can enter and specify data.
To do this, I will delete all the code in my page except "connect include".
If I don't connect to my database, it's not going to work.
There is a lot of extracting and some other things to be found.
I will retain firstname,  lastname, date of birth  and gender- either female or male.
Below here, I will create a form.
This will be an html form, so we need to start and end our tags.
Our action will be "mysql dot php" and our method is going to be "POST".
Here we will create a form in which the user can specify a name.
For the name we will use our "surname".
You can use any one of them. For example, your date of birth or gender to search.
It is your choice.
You could even use 2 fields to search.
I will now show you how to use 2 fields so that you know that it is not very complicated but easy.
Here I will type "Firstname" and I will create an input box of type "text " and the name of this will be "firstname".
We will create a break here and type "Lastname".
Next we will create another input box  by copying the previous line and pasting it here.
So, this line is exactly the same  but instead of "Firstname", we type in "Lastname".
We will type input type equals "submit" and the value of that will be "Get data".
Hence we have taken the "Firstname" and "Lastname" and the "submit" button.
If I refresh this, we can see "Firstname" and "Lastname" have appeared.
I will delete this for now and to do this, I will check if the "submit" button has been pressed.
To do this, I will first name the "submit" button as "submit".
Then I will type in an if statement - if dollar underscore POST 'submit'.
If the submit button has been pressed,  start the block.
This is the block of code to be executed and we end our block where we want this to end.
This is after this curly bracket here because that is a part of our while statement here.
We don't actually need our while statement for this.  But I will still keep it for the sake of it.
I will now type "grab POST data" and dollar firstname.
So this is dollar underscore POST 'firstname' and then I will type 'lastname'.
I will copy 'firstname' and paste it here and change it to 'lastname'.
So we have got our 'firstname' and 'lastname'.
I will type: echo and this message Record for $firstname . On second thoughts, let us not do this at the moment.
I will go straight to my query here.
If you remember, I had mentioned that you can specify what data you want in particular.
For this, I will type SELECT star FROM people WHERE firstname equals 'Alex' and lastname equals 'Garrett'.
I had not shown this inside this piece of query where we are selecting.
I had shown it in the update  where we can update where the firstname equals "Alex" and the lastname equals "Garrett".
Now we will select everything we want from our table here and we will say- select everything where our firstname is 'Alex' to lastname is 'Garrett'.
If we look at our database here, we are searching for our firstname and matching it to "Alex", searching the surname and matching it to "Garrett".
We are selecting this whole row of data over here which is highlighted in pink at the moment and we are just selecting the whole data from here.
From the date of birth to gender, my id to my firstname and lastname.
So we have understood that this will select only one record at this time, therefore we don't need to order by the "id".
But I will keep it like that anyway, since there is only one record.
Ordering is not an issue,  so we can just leave it that way.
Ok, so we are running our loop, we are selecting each part of data here and we are changing our male to "Male" and female to "Female".
The echoing out our data based on this query because this data based query is specific to my first and surname.
Then we are only going to echo out the firstname and the lastname over here that has been found which is my first and lastname but by changing "Alex" here to $firstname which is here.
Now that's a repetition. This is a double variable here.
We have the "firstname" and so here, I will name this as "$firstname underscore form" and "$lastname underscore form"
We will select from where the firstname has been posted equal to this and the lastname that we posted equal to lastname_form.
So, this is the data that's come from our form.
So, if I were to type "Alex Garrett" in my html form and submit it then this will equal 'Alex' and this will equal 'Garrett'.
Our query will return only one result because at the moment we have only one person named "Alex Garrett".
So, it will take all the data for "Alex Garrett" and check for 'Female' or 'Male' and then echo out this particular message.
So, if I come here and refresh, at the moment there is nothing because no data has been specified in these form variables here.
Let me show you. These are empty. Therefore we are selecting star from people under this condition WHERE the name equals to nothing and the lastname equals to nothing.
That has not returned any data at the moment because what we got in our firstname and lastname are actual people's names.
Anyway, now I will just type in a completely random name.
So let's say "David Green" and click Get data and nothing has happened, ok?
If we had an error message at the end over here,  this is our query written over here,  I could say "or die mysql error".
I go back here and say "David Green" and click Get data and oh! we don't have an error!
Oh yes!! That's because the structure of the sql code correct and so we don't get any error.
I was just testing that out.
Now let's suppose that we do have a name that's in our database.
Let's say "Alex Garrett" and we click "Get data".
We are presented here with "Alex Garrett was born blah blah blah and is Male".
Let's type "Dale Garrett" and click "Get data" and we receive that information from the database.
So, you can see that this is very useful to incorporate forms into our data.
I will stop here and go on to the next part where I will be talking about how to update records using this method.
Many of you would be able to do that on your own by now but I will take you through it anyway along with a few other useful things.
Ok so, see you soon.  This is Evan Varkey, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project. (Script contributed by Juanita Jayakar).

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on abstract class and pure virtual function in C++.
Abstract Classes, Pure virtual function.
Ubuntu OS version 11.10
g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with an introduction to abstract class.
Abstract class is always a base class.
It contains at least one pure virtual function.
We cannot create an instance of abstract class.
Let us see pure virtual function.
A pure virtual function is a function with no body.
It is not defined in the base class.
It is declared as:
virtual void virtualfunname()=0;
A derived class must override the function.
Otherwise the compiler will give an error.
It is up to a derived class to implement the function.
Let us look at an example.
Note that our file name is abstract.cpp.
This example involves addition and subtraction of two numbers.
This is declaration for a class named abstractinterface.
Then we have public specifier.
In this, we have declared a virtual function named numbers().
It is initialized to 0.
Then we have a non-virtual function.
And two integer variables as 'a' and 'b'.
Here, we access the input function.
In this, we accept the numbers 'a' and 'b'.
This is a derived class named add.
It inherits the properties of the base class "abstractinterface".
Here we override the function numbers().
In this, we perform addition of two numbers 'a'and 'b'
and store the result in integer variable "sum".
Here we have another derived class as sub.
This also inherits the base class "abstractinterface".
In this, again we override the function numbers().
And here we calculate the difference of two numbers 'a' and 'b'.
Then we print the difference.
Here we create an object of class "add" as obj1.
Then we call both the functions input() and numbers() using the object obj1.
Then we create another object of class "sub" as obj2.
Again, we call the two functions using the object obj2.
And this is our 'return' statement.
To compile, type:
press Enter.Type: dot slash abs
It is displayed as  Enter the numbers.
I will enter as 9 and 4.
The output is displayed as Sum is 13.
Again we see Enter the numbers.
I will enter as 8 and 3.
The output is displayed as diff is 5.
In this tutorial, we learnt:Abstract class e.g. class abstractinterface.
Pure virtual function e.g. virtual void numbers()=0;
As an assignment- Create an abstract class student.
Create a pure virtual function as Info.
Accept the name and roll no of the student in the function.
Create two derived classes marks and sports.
In marks, accept marks of three subjects.
In sports, enter marks scored in sports.
Calculate the total marks.
Then create another derived class as result.
In this, display the name, roll-no and total marks of the student.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Basics of Shell Scripting.
System variables
User defined variables and
Accepting user input via keyboard.
Please NoteGNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.
Let us start with an introduction to variables.
Bash variables provide temporary storage for information.
These variables can be used within the lifespan of the program.
There are two types of variables: System variables,User defined variables .
System variables: These are created and maintained by Linux Bash Shell itself.
They are defined by capital letters.
Commonly used system variables are-
BASH_VERSION . HOSTNAME
HOME etc.
Let us open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously  on your keyboard.
Now, type: set and press Enter.
This will display all the system variables.
Alternately, you can type env or printenv to view all the system variables.
Now, type: echo space within double quotes dollar sign HOSTNAME
now press Enter.
The hostname of the system will be displayed.
Now let's find out the full path of homedirectory.
Type:  echo space within double quotes dollar sign HOME(in capital).
The full path of user's home directory will be displayed.
Now, type:echo space within double quotes HOME (in capital).
This will display only the "HOME", not the value of HOME variable.
So, it is necessary to use dollar sign( $) at the beginning of every variable to display its value.
Let us switch back to our slides.
User Defined Variables:
These variables are created and maintained by users.
It is always a good idea to avoid uppercase for the names of user defined variables.
This makes it easy to differentiate between user defined and system variables.
Switch back to our terminal.
Type: username equal to sign sunita
Please note that there should not be any blank space between username, equal to sign and sunita.
Now, press Enter. To display the value of variable username,
Type: echo space within double quotes dollar sign username
This will display sunita on your terminal.
The value of a variable can be unset.
Let us switch back to our slides.
unset- the value of a variable can be unset by using the unset command.
The syntax for this is- unset variablename
Let's use the previous example where username is our variable.
Switch to the Terminal.  Now type: unset space username, press Enter.
Let us check. Type: echo space within double quotes dollar sign username  press Enter.
Nothing will be displayed on the terminal.
This means that the value of variable username has been removed.
Now switch back to our slide.
Global and local variables:
In Shell script, user defined variables can be declared globally or locally.
By default, all variables are global.
This means, their values remain the same inside and outside the function.
Let us learn how to declare variables globally and locally.
Switch to the terminal . Type:
gedit space g_(underscore)variable.sh space & (ampersand sign).
gedit is the text editor g_(underscore) variable.sh is our file name
and '&' (ampersand) is used to free up the prompt.
Type the code as shown here, in your "g_(underscore)variable.sh" file.
The first line with the hash and exclamation symbol is a shebang or a bang line.
username=sunita is the userdefined variable and it is declared globally.
echo will display the string "outside function:"  and
dollar username will print the value of the variable username.
This is how we define a function in BASH script.
We will discuss about functions in detail, in later tutorials.
This is the body of the function.
Here, another message "inside function" will be displayed along with the value of username.
Here, we call the function.
This is our code. Now let's execute it.
Come back to our Terminal.
First we need to make our file executable.
Type: chmod space plus x space g_(underscore)variable.sh,  press Enter.
Now, type: dot slash g_(Underscore)variable.sh
Observe the output. Outside the function, username takes the value sunita.
Inside the function also, username takes the same value sunita.
This is because username was declared globally outside the function.
Next, let us learn how to declare a variable locally.
Type: gedit space l_(Underscore)variable.sh space & (ampersand sign).
Type the code as shown here, in your "l_(underscore)variable.sh" file.
The code is the same as before except for an extra line of code inside the function.
Inside the function block, we have a line- local space username equals to jack.
This assigns a new value for the variable username locally.
Now switch to the Terminal.
Let's make the file executable
by typing chmod space plus x space l_variable.sh
Type: dot slash l_variable.sh
Press Enter.The output is displayed.
Outside the function, username takes the value sunita
whereas inside the function, username takes the value jack.
This is because username is assigned this value locally, within the function.
Now let us quickly see how to get user input via keyboard.
The read command is used to accept input from the keyboard.
It can also be used to assign an input value to a user defined variable.
The syntax of read command is-
read space hyphen p space within double quotes PROMPT
Please note that PROMPT is just a string that waits for user input.
You may replace it with your own string.
Now, switch to the terminal .
Type: gedit space read.sh space &  (ampersand sign)
Press Enter. Type the code as shown here in your  "read.sh" file.
In this example, input is given from the keyboard by the user.
This is the bang line.
Here -p displays the prompt without a newline and takes input from the keyboard.
The user input will be stored in the variable username.
echo command displays the message
Hello and the name entered by the user via the keyboard.
So, let us  execute the program.
Type: chmod space plus x space read.sh
press Enter.  Type: dot slash read.sh  press Enter.
Here it is displayed Enter username:
I will type ashwini,  press Enter.
The message Hello ashwini is displayed.
ashwini was assigned as an input value to the user defined variable username.
In this tutorial, we learnt:
System variables , User defined variables and
Accepting user input via keyboard.
As an assignment- Write a simple Bash program to get the following system variables.
pwd  and * logname.
Write a simple Bash program
to ask username from user
to exit the program, if user does not enter anything within 10 seconds.
{Hint: read -(Hyphen)t 10 -(Hyphen)p}
It summarizes the Spoken-Tutorial project.
More information on this mission is available at the link shown below:
The script has been contributed  by FOSSEE and Spoken Tutorial teams.
Slope signifies rate of change of y value with respect to x value. y-intercept is y value when x=0.
Let us begin the demonstration.
Let's uncheck Hide lines and Hide grid check boxes to enable Slope check box.
Click on Slope-Intercept screen. Screen opens with a line y= 2/3x+1 (2 by 3 x plus 1).
Drag the purple point on y-axis. Notice that purple point represents the intercept.
Now adjust m again to 2/3 and increase b value to 4.
Drag the purple and blue points freely across the graph to modify the equation of the line.
Click on Save line. Line is saved.
Lets summarize.

Hello Friends. Welcome to the tutorial on "Getting Started with Strings".
At the end of this tutorial, you will learn to,
What are strings?
Strings in triple quotes can be written in multiple lines.
We can also define empty strings. String is a collection of characters which cannot be modified after it is created.
Let us first open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously. Type ipython3 and press Enter.
Let us initialise the pylab package.Type %pylab and press Enter.
Let us clear the terminal.
Type a is equal to inside any quotes Hello comma World exclamation mark and
Now let us learn string concatenation. Let us assign strings to variables.
Type
Now, let us add the two strings.
print inside parentheses z
The addition operation performs the concatenation of two strings.
Here we can see the output of string concatenation.
Let us clear the terminal.
Recall x string.
The string Hello is repeated 5 times after multiplying.
Switch to the terminal for solution. Type, s is equal to inside quotes two percentages plus inside quotes hyphen multiplied by twenty plus inside quotes  two percentages
print inside parentheses  s Press Enter
Let's now look at accessing individual elements of strings.  We can access individual elements in the string using the subscripts.
Let us clear the terminal.
The indexing starts from 0 and goes up to (n-1).
We can access the strings from the end using negative indices.
a inside square brackets minus one gives us the last element of the string i.e. exclamation mark
a inside square brackets minus two gives us the second element from the end of the string i.e. d
Pause the video. Try this exercise and then resume the video. Given a string, s which is Hello World, what is the output of the following
Let us clear the terminal.
s inside square brackets minus five gives W
s inside square brackets minus 15 gives us an IndexError.  Since the string given to us is only 11 characters long.
s inside square brackets 15 again gives IndexError for the same reason.
Let us attempt to change one of the characters in a string.
Let us manipulate x.
Why do we get an error?
Now we are trying to assign another value ‘B’ to x[0]. Recall, strings cannot be modified after it is created.
We can split and join the strings by using the functions : split() and join()
To join a string, the syntax is str dot join inside parentheses sequence
Let us clear the terminal
Type s is equal to inside quotes hyphen press Enter seq is equal to inside parentheses  a comma b comma  c press Enter
print s dot join' inside parentheses seq press Enter
We will get output as a hyphen b hyphen c It has joined a, b, c with hyphen.
To split a string, syntax is str dot split open and close parentheses
Switch to the terminal
We get the output like this. It has split the strings at spaces.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
1. Write code to assign the string ’ is called the apostrophe, to variable s
3. The variables s and t are strings and r is integer.
They are assigned with the values as shown below, What is the output of s multiplied by r plus t multiplied by r?
The operation s multiplied by r plus t multiplied by r will print each of the two words twice as HelloHelloWorldWorld

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Tokens in C and C Plus Plus.
In this tutorial we will learn ,
How to define and use tokens.
We will do this with the help of an example.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
Token is a generic word for data types, variables, constants and identifiers.
Let us start with our program.
Note that our file name is 'tokens.c'.
In this program we will initialize the variables and print their values.
This is our main function.
Here, int is a keyword.
The compiler knows the meaning of keyword.
a is an integer variable.
We have assigned a value of 2 to it.
This is called as initialization.
If a value is not assigned to a variable then it is called as declaration of the variable.
Here, b is a constant.
We have initialized 'b' by assigning a value of 4 to it.
const keyword is used to create 'read only' variable.
Let us switch back to our slides to know more about keywords and constant.
Keywords have fixed meanings that cannot be changed.
Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
There are 32 keywords in C.
To name some, auto, break, case, char, enum, extern, etc.
Constants: constants are fixed values.
They do not change during the execution of a program.
There are two types of constants, Numeric constants and Character constants.
Here, float is a data type of variable c.
We have assigned it a value of 1.5.
Data type is a finite set of values along with a set of rules.
Here, d is a variable.
char and single quotes suggest that we are dealing with a character.
As a result, d is a character variable  storing the value A.
It is easy to see that int, double, float and char are data types.
a, c and d are variables.
Now come back to our slides.
We will know more about data types and variables.
Data types: Let us begin with integer data type.
It is declared as int.
If we want to print an integer data type , we will use %d as the format specifier.
Similarly, we will use float and %f for floating point numbers.
For character data type, we will  use char and %c.
And For double data type, we will use double and %lf as the format specifier.
Now we will see the range of data types.
Integer data type has a range of this
Floating point has a range of this
Character has a range of this
And Double has a range of this
The values stored in the variable must not be greater or less than this range.
Now we will move on to variables.
Variable is a data name.
It may be used to store a data value .
The values can change when a program runs.
Before using a variable it must be declared.
We should try to give meaningful names to  variables.
example john, marks, sum etc.
Now we will move back to our program.
Here, printf is the identifier name for this function.
Let us know about identifiers.
Identifiers are user defined names.
An identifier consists of letters and digits.
Both uppercase and lowercase letters are permitted.
First character must be an alphabet or underscore.
Now Come back to our program.
Here we have initialized the variables and constants.
Here we print them.
Now click on Save.
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
To compile, type gcc space tokens dot c space hyphen o tok. Press Enter.
To execute, type ./tok (dot slash tok).
We can see that here we have six values after the decimal point.
And here we have two values.
Now let us find out how this happened. Come back to our program.
This is because we have % point 2f here.
It denotes that we can print only two values after the decimal point.
Suppose here I want an output with three decimal places.
Let us replace % point 2f with % point 3f.
Now click on Save.
Compile as before, execute as before.
We see here three values after the decimal point.
Now we will execute the same program in c++.
First press Shift+Ctrl+s keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension .cpp and click on Save.
Let us change the header file as iostream
Now  include the using statement.
And click on Save.
Now replace the printf statement with the  cout  statement
since we use cout<< function to print a line in C++.
Click on Search for and replace text option.
Type here printf opening bracket “(”
And here in this column type, cout and two opening angle brackets “<<”.
Now click on Replace All  and click on Close.
We don't need the format specifier and '\n'
Let us delete them.
Now delete the comma and  type two opening angle brackets.
Click on Save. Now delete the closing bracket.
Type two opening angle brackets again.
And within the double quotes type \n.
Now Click on Save.
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
To compile, type g++ space  tokens dot cpp space hyphen o space tok1.
Here we have tok1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter tok for the file tokens.c.
To execute, type ./tok1 . Press Enter.
Now let us move on to some common errors which we can come across.
Suppose here I will reassign a new value to b as 8.
Now click on Save. Let us see what happens.
Now compile as before.
We see an error at line no.7 in our tokens. cpp file.
"Assignment of read only variable 'b' ".
This is because 'b' is a constant. Constants are  fixed values.
They do not change during the execution of program.
Delete this. Click on Save.
Let us execute again. Come back to our terminal.
Compile as before.
Execute as before. Yes, it is working.
Now we will see another common error.
Switch back to our program.
Suppose here I will miss the single quotes. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our  terminal.
Compile as before.
We see an error at line no.9 in our tokens dot cpp file.
" 'A' was not declared in the scope". Come back to our program.
This is because anything within the single quotes is considered as a character value.
And here we have declared 'd' as a character variable.
Let us fix the error. Type single quotes at line no.9 here.
Now Click on Save. Let us execute.
Now Compile as before.
Execute as before. Yes it is working.
Now switch back to our slides.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial we learnt,
Data types eg. int, double, float etc.
Variables eg. int a=2;
Identifiers eg. printf() and
Constant eg. double const b=4;
As an assignment,Write a  program to calculate the simple interest.
Hint: principal * rate * time upon  100.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Flow over a flat plate using OpenFOAM.
In this tutorial, I will teach you about:
The tutorials were recorded using the versions specified in previous slide. Subsequently the tutorials were edited to latest versions. To install latest system requirements go to Installation Sheet
Flow over flat plate is a fundamental problem in fluid mechanics.
We can visualize the growth of the boundary layer. Boundary layer is a very thin region above the body
where the velocity is 0.99 times the free stream velocity.
This is a diagram of flow over the flat plate.
The boundary conditions are given as follows.
The Free stream velocity U = 1 m/s and we are solving this for Reynolds number (Re) = 100.
Now let us go to the home folder. In the home folder, click on the OpenFoam folder.
Then go to the 'run' directory. You will see 'Tutorials'. Click on it. Scroll down and then click on Incompressible. Scroll down.
You will see the 'simpleFoam' folder. Click on it. This solver suits our case.
In this, create a folder by the name flatplate. Right click - Create New Folder - flatplate.
Now, let's open the pitzdaily case.
Let me zoom this. Copy the three folders - 0, constant and system. Copy this.
Now let us go one level back. Paste these  three folders inside the flatplate folder.
Open the constant folder and then the polyMesh folder.
Change the geometry and boundary condition names in the blockMeshDict file.
I have already made the changes. Let us open the blockMeshDict file . Scroll down. The geometry is in meters.
We have set the dimensions of the flatplate.
We can see the  simpleGrading. It is kept as (1 3 1) as we need a finer mesh near the plate.
Now close this. Go two levels back.
Similarly, make changes in the boundary condition names inside the files in the '0' folder.
These files have pressure, velocity and wall functions.
To calculate the values of wall functions, please refer to the earlier tutorial in the OpenFoam series. Let us go one level back.
The system folder can be kept default. Let us close this.
Now let us open the terminal window. In the terminal window, type "run" and press Enter.
Type cd space tutorials  press Enter.
Type cd incompressible press Enter.
Type cd space simpleFoam press Enter.
We can see the flatplate folder.
Now, type cd space flatplate and press Enter.
You can see the three folders 0, constant and system.
Now, we will mesh the geometry. We are using a course mesh for this problem. Meshing can be done by typing blockMesh in the terminal.
Press Enter. Meshing has been done.
Note that if there is some error in the blockMesh file, it will be shown in the terminal window.
To view the geometry, type “paraFoam”, press Enter.
After the ParaView window opens, on the left hand side of the object inspector menu, click Apply.
We can see the geometry. Close the ParaView window. Let me switch back to the slides.
The solver we are using here is simpleFoam. SimpleFoam is a steady state solver  for in compressible and turbulent flows.
Let me switch back to the terminal window. In the terminal window, type "simpleFoam" and press Enter.
You will see the iterations running in the terminal window.
Once the solving is done, type "paraFoam" to view the results.
On the left hand side of the Object Inspector menu, click Apply to view the geometry.
Scroll down the properties panel of the Object Inspector menu for time step, regions and fields.
To view the contours from the top drop down menu, in the Active Variable Control menu, change from solid color to capital 'U'.
You can see the initial condition of the velocity.
Now on top of the ParaView window, you will see the VCR control.
Click on the Play button.
You will see the contour of Pressure or Velocity on the flat plate accordingly.
This is the velocity contour. Toggle on the Color legend.
To do this, click on the color legend icon on the Active Variable Control menu.
Click Apply in the Object inspector menu.
In the Object inspector menu, click on Display.
Scroll down and click on Rescale to data range.
Let me shift this Color legend on top to visualize the Vector Plot. Go to the Filters Menu > Common > Glyph.
Go to the Properties in Object Inspector menu.
Click Apply on the left hand side of Object Inspector menu.
You can change the number of vectors by changing their size at the bottom.
Also, the size of the vectors can be changed by clicking on the Edit button. The Set Scale Factor can be changed to 0.1.
Again, click the Apply button.
Now let me zoom this.
To do this, in the Active Variable Control menu, click on zoom To Box option
and zoom over any area that you desire.
We can see the parabolic variation of the vector plots as the flow moves over the plate.
Delete this. Now delete the vector plot.
Also, we can see that the color near to 1 corresponds to the velocity of 0.99 times the free stream velocity.
You can also plot the variation of velocity along the X and Y axes using the plot over data line.
This brings us to the end of the tutorial. In this tutorial, we learnt:
As an Assignment- Create a geometry of flow over a flat plate.Refine the grid spacing near the plate.

Welcome to this tutorial on how to write letters using latex.
You can see three windows.
These correspond to the three distinct phases in typesetting through latex:
creation of source file, compilation to produce the pdf file and viewing it through a pdf reader.
I am using the free pdf reader “Skim” in Mac OSX because it automatically loads the latest pdf file after every compilation.
There are pdf browsers in Linux and also in Windows that have this capability.
Let us go through the source file and see what each command does.
The first line says that this belongs to 'letter document' class.
12 point is the text size.
The first component of the letter is the ‘from address’. It appears between the braces here.
The result of this is seen in the top right hand corner of the output file.
Two consecutive slashes start a new line.
If I remove the double slashes from here –
save, compile using pdflatex –
you can see that these two lines get merged in one line.
Previously with a double slash we asked latex to split the line.
Now these reverse slashes are no longer there, so latex does not know that it has to break the line there.
Let me put the slashes back.
Save, Compile.
It is to be understood that after every change we need to save before compilation.
Let us see what happens when we give an empty address.
Let me just come here,
mark it,
go to the end of the line, delete it, save it, compile it.
You can see that the from address has disappeared from here.
Note that today’s date appears automatically in American style: month, date and then year.
This is obtained through the command slash date slash today.
We can prevent the automatic appearance of the date with an empty list, as we do now.
Save.
Compile,The date has gone.
Suppose that we want to put our own date, let us enter it with date first as follows.
9th July 2007, Save, Compile.
Got the date.
This is the date on which this tutorial was created the first time.
On compiling it, we see this Indian format appearing in the output file.
Let us put the address back.
And the document is back to the previous state by recompiling.
The signature command's argument appears at the bottom of the letter.
We begin the document and then the letter.
The ‘to address’ comes first. It appears in the top left hand corner of the output.
I have addressed this to Mr. N. K. Sinha.
The command ‘slash opening’ is used to address the recipient.
You may have already noticed that all latex commands begin with a reverse slash.
The text of the letter comes next.
One starts a new paragraph in latex through a blank line as we show now.
Let me come here. Right now this sentence starting at ‘we are’ is here.
Let’s open. Let's take this to the next line.
I have left a blank line. Let me save this.
Compile this.
You can see that this has gone to a new paragraph.
With a new paragraph, the letter has gone to two pages.
Let us see if the font size is reduced to 10, we can bring the letter back to one page.
Let me do that now.
Save.
Compile,You can see that the whole letter has come into one page.
Let me put this back to 12 pt.
And let me also remove this paragraph bit.
And let me compile this.
Okay.
I now want to explain the itemize environment which is created with a pair of 'begin' and 'end itemize' commands.
Every piece of text that starts with a ‘slash item’ appears in a bulleted form.
Can I get numbers in the place of bullets here?
You just have to change the "itemize" into "enumerate" as I do now.
Let me just change this to "enumerate".
Of course! It is always a good idea to save as often as possible.
Let me compile this again.
You can see that the bullets have become numbers now.
In closing, I have included, ‘Yours sincerely’ which comes here.
We have already talked about the signature.
Finally, the command 'cc' helps mark this letter to other recipients.
I end the letter with ‘end letter’ command and then the document is completed with the ‘end document’ command.
Feel free to modify the content and try them out.
Until you become confident, change only one thing at a time and make sure by immediate compilation that whatever you have done is correct.
Although I talked about the letter writing process in a Mac, the same source file will work in all Latex systems including those in Linux and Windows operating systems.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on iterative calculations using Scilab.
I am using Scilab version 5.2 in Mac operating system
but these calculations should work in other versions and also in Scilab that runs in Linux and Windows.
I will use the code available in the file 'iteration.sce'.
I have opened this file using Scilab editor which I plan to use only as an editor.
Let us create a vector using the colon operator. 'i' is equal to 1 colon 5,
creates a vector from 1 to 5, in increments of 1.
In this command,  'i' is equal to 1 colon 2 colon 5.
We see that the middle argument of 2 indicates the increment.
1 is the first argument where the vector starts. 'i' cannot go beyond 5,
it can be equal to 5, however.
Note that if the ending argument changes to 6 the result remains the same.
It is not difficult to explain this behavior.
Can you think for a moment why this happens?
We will now demonstrate the use of the for statement to perform iterative calculations.
for i is equal to 1 colon 2 colon 7 disp i end of for loop.
I will cut this, paste in Scilab console, press Enter.
This code prints out 'i' as we go through the loop.
The display is due to the command disp - the passed argument is displayed.
Recall that the for loop is used for integer values.
In this case, four integer values, namely, 1, 3, 5 and 7 are displayed.
The number of times the iterations take place is known as priori in for loops.
In the rest of this tutorial, we will stick to the default increment of 1.
Let us begin with the loop that displays 'i' equal to 1 to 5.
We will modify this code by introducing the break statement.
Note that 'i' is displayed only up to 2.
The iteration is not carried out till the last value of i, namely 5.
When i is equal to 2, the if block is executed for the first time.
The break command, however, terminates the loop.
If we want to get out of a loop when some intermediate condition is satisfied, we can use the break statement.
Note that "i is equal to 2" statement uses the "equal to" sign twice.
This is the standard way to compare the equality in programming languages.
The result of this comparison statement is a Boolean: true or false.
We will introduce the continue statement here, paste, press Enter.
This results in 'i' getting displayed only for 4 and 5.
For 'i' less than or equal to 3, as given by the i less than or equal to 3 statement, nothing happens.
The continue statement makes the program skip the rest of the loop.
Unlike the break statement, however, it does not exit the loop.
The parameter 'i' is incremented and all the calculations of the loop are executed for the new i.
We take a small break and show how to get help for operators of the type 'less than or equal to' (<=).
Let us type 'less than or equal to with help'.
This opens the Scilab Help Browser.
We see that the help is available under the option less.
So now after closing this, we type help less.
We see the required help instructions here. I will close this.
The for statement in Scilab is more powerful than in programming languages.
For example, let us perform a loop over a vector:
This script displays all values of 'v'.
Until now we have been displaying only the variables.
We can indeed display the result of a calculation as well.
The following code displays the square of the numbers.
We have spent quite a bit of time explaining the for loop.
Let us now move on to the while loops.
The while statement allows us to perform a loop when a Boolean expression is true.
At the beginning of the loop, if the expression is true,
the statements in the body of the while loop are executed.
If the program is written well, the expression becomes false and the loop is ended.
Now let us see an example for the while loop:
The values of 'i', from 1 to 6 are displayed.
Break and continue statements inside the while loop work exactly as they did in the for loop as we demonstrate using break:
We can see that the moment 'i' becomes equal to 3, the program exits the loop, thanks to the break statement.
You can also try the example for continue statement in while loop.
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on iterative calculations using Scilab.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Conductivity of ionic solutions.
In this tutorial, we will learnt to:
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with ExpEYES Junior interface.
Let's first define conductivity of a solution.
Conductivity of a solution is a measure of its ability to conduct electricity.
Conductivity of water is directly related to the concentration of ions dissolved in it.
Now we will demonstrate conductivity of tap water.
I will explain the circuit connections. A1 is connected to SINE.
Wires from SINE and A2 are dipped in glass tumbler containing tap water.
A 10K resistor is connected between A2 and GND. This is the circuit diagram.
On the Plot window, click on A1 and drag to CH1. A1 is assigned to CH1.
Black trace is the original sine wave. Red trace is conductivity of tap water.
Click on CH1 and drag to FIT. Click on CH2 and drag to FIT.
Observe the voltage and frequency values on the right side of the window. Notice that voltage of tap water is very less compared to the input voltage.
Right click on CH1 to see voltages and Phase difference in degree.
Now we will measure conductivity of copper sulphate solution. To make the solution, one spatula of copper sulphate is dissolved in 100 ml of water.
In the same connection, wires from SINE and A2 are dipped in copper sulphate solution.
On the Plot window we can see the conductivity curve.
Red trace is conductivity of copper sulphate solution.
Increased conductivity is due to copper and sulphate ions present in the solution.
Observe the voltage and frequency values on the right.
Right click on CH1 to see voltages and Phase difference values.
Now, we will measure conductivity of dilute sulphuric acid solution. A few drops of dilute sulphuric acid are added to water.
Wires are dipped in sulphuric acid solution. Let's see the result on the Plot window.
Observe that black and red traces are almost coinciding with each other.
Conductivity of tap water has increased on adding a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid.
Observe the voltage and frequency values on the right.
Right click on CH1 to see voltages and Phase difference in degree.
We will measure conductivity of dilute Potassium hydroxide solution. A few drops of dilute Potassium hydroxide solution are added to tap water.
We can see that black and red traces are almost coinciding with each other.
Notice the increased conductivity of tap water on adding a few drops of Potassium hydroxide solution.
Right click on CH1 to see voltages and Phase difference in degree.
Using the voltage values we have calculated the resistance of ionic solutions and tabulated the results.
Resistance value for tap water is 7.7 KOhm (kilo ohm).
Sulphuric acid solution is 0.17 KOhm and  potassium hydroxide solution is 0.14 KOhm.
As an assignment,Using sodium hydroxide, acetic acid and sodium chloride solutions measure conductivity and calculate the resistance of ionic solutions.
We conduct workshops using Spoken Tutorials  and give certificates. Please contact us.
This tutorial is contributed by  Kaushik Datta and Madhuri Ganapathi.Thank you for joining.
Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Working with Cells.
How to enter numbers, text, numbers as text, date and time in a spreadsheet.
How to use the Format Cells dialog box.
How to navigate between cells and in between sheets.
How to select items in rows, columns and sheets.
We will be using GNU/Linux as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
So, let us first learn how to enter data in the cells.
We shall open our “personal finance tracker.ods” file.
You can type any text in a particular cell by simply clicking on the cell and then typing the text, using the keyboard.
The text is left-aligned, by default.  One can change the alignment by clicking any one of the alignment tabs on the Formatting Bar.
Now click on the cell corresponding to “A1” in the spreadsheet.
You see that the selected cell gets highlighted.
Here, we have already typed the column headings.
Under the heading “Items”, we shall type the names of a few items one below the other as-  “Salary”, “House rent”, “Electricity bill”, “Phone bill”, “Laundry” and “Miscellaneous”.
In order to enter numbers in the cell, click on the cell and type in the numbers.
To enter a negative number, either type a minus sign in front of it or enclose it in parentheses.
By default, numbers are right-aligned and negative numbers have a leading minus symbol.
Now, under the Serial Number heading, denoted as “SN” in our “personal finance tracker.ods” spreadsheet, we want the serial number of each item one below the other.
So, click on the cell corresponding to “A2” and enter numbers as 1, 2, 3 one below the other.
In order to auto-fill the serial numbers, click on the cell “A4”.  A little black box is visible at the bottom-right corner of the cell.  Drag it till cell “A7” and release the mouse button.
You will see that the cells “A5” till “A7” get populated with the subsequent serial numbers.
After entering the serial number of the items, we will now enter the cost of each item under the heading “Cost”.
So, we click on the cell referenced as “C3” and type the expense for “House rent” as “Rupees 6000”.
Now, what if we want to precede the number with the Rupee symbol?
Let's say, we want to enter “Rupees 800” for “Electricity bill”.  So, right-click on the cell 'C4' and click on “Format Cells” option.
This will open the “Format Cells” dialog-box.
The first tab is “Numbers”. Click on it, if not already selected.
Various categories can be seen under “Category” such as Number, Percent, Currency, Date, Time and many more.
Let's select Currency.
Now, under the Format option, click on the down-arrow. This will display the various currency symbols from across the world.
Let's scroll up and select INR Rupees English India.  By default, Rupees 1234 is selected in the drop-down below.
You can see a preview of it in the small preview area on the right.
Under Options, we have the option to add the number of Decimal places and the number of Leading zeroes that we want.
Notice that as we increase the number of zeroes, the selection under Format has changed to Rupees 1,234 decimal zero zero, indicating 2 decimal places.
Notice the change is displayed in the preview area.
Click on Thousands separator to add the “comma” separator for each thousand. Once again, notice the change in the preview area.
One can also change the font style by clicking on the Font tab.  It has various options for Font, Typeface and Size.
Explore Font Effects and the other tabs to learn more about them.
We will learn about the options in the 'Alignment' tab in another tutorial later.
Let's click on OK.
Let's type 800 and press Enter.  You will notice that the number 800 is represented as Rupees 800 with 2 decimal places.
Now, let's select cells C5 to C7.  Hold the Ctrl key and select cell G2 also.  Notice all the selected cells are highlighted.
Right-click on any of the highlighted cells and select Format Cells.
Choose the same options as before. Click on OK.
Now, we type the expenses on all the other items one below the other as- “Rupees 600” for “Phone bill”, ”Rupees 300” as “Laundry” charges and “Rupees 2000” as other “Miscellaneous” charges.
Under the heading “Accounts”, we type the salary for the month as “Rupees 30000”.
For entering date in Calc, select the cell and type the date.
You can separate the date elements with a forward slash or a hyphen or use text such as 10 October 2011.
Calc recognizes a variety of date formats.
Alternately, one can right-click on the cell and choose “Format Cells” option.
Choose “Date” under category and the desired format under “Format”.  I will choose 12, 31, 1999.  Notice the display in the preview area.
Also, the Format code is displayed below as MM, DD and YYYY.  One can change the Format code as required.
I will type DD, MM and YYYY.  Notice the change in the preview area. Click on OK.
For entering time in Calc, select the cell and type the time.
You can separate time elements with colon such as 10 colon 43 colon 20.
Alternately, one can right-click on the cell and choose “Format Cells” option.
Choose “Time” under category and the desired format under “Format”.  I will choose 13, 37, 46.  Notice the display in the preview area.
Also, the Format-code is displayed below as HH:MM:SS. One can change the Format-code as required. I will type HH:MM.
Notice the change in the preview area. Click on OK.
After learning how to write text, numbers and dates in Calc, we will now learn how to navigate within a spreadsheet from cell to cell and from sheet to sheet.
So, we will first see how we can navigate from cell to cell within a spreadsheet.
You can simply access a particular cell by clicking on it with the cursor.
You see that the particular cell gets highlighted.
Another method of accessing a particular cell is by using a cell reference.
Click on the little black down arrow just to the right of the “Name Box”.
Now type the cell-reference of the cell you want to go to and press “Enter” .
You can even click into the “Name box”, delete the existing cell reference and type in the cell reference you want and press “Enter”.
Next we will learn how to navigate between cells in a spreadsheet.
The first method of navigation between cells is by using the cursor.
To move the focus using the cursor, simply move the cursor to the cell where you want the focus to be and click the left mouse button.
This changes the focus to the new cell.
This method is most useful when the two cells are a large distance apart.
Another method of navigation between cells are - * "Tab" to go to the next cell in a row,
”Shift + Tab” to go to the previous cell in a row,
“Enter”  to go to the next cell in a column,
“Shift + Enter” to go to the previous cell in a  column.
Next, we will learn how to navigate between different spreadsheets in Calc using the keyboard.
For accessing the sheet to the right of the active sheet, press the “Control” plus “Page Down” keys simultaneously.
In order to access the sheet to the left of the current sheet,  press the Control plus Page  Up  keys simultaneously.
You can also navigate between sheets using the cursor.
Detailed information on this is available in the tutorial “Working with Sheets”.
If you have a number of sheets then some of the sheet tabs may be hidden behind the horizontal scroll-bar at the bottom of the screen.
If this is the case then the four buttons at the bottom-left of the sheet tabs can move the tabs into view.
For selecting a range of contiguous cells with the cursor, first click in a cell.
Now press and hold down the left mouse button.
Move the cursor around the screen and once the desired block of cells is highlighted, release the left mouse button. You see that the selected cells are highlighted.

what is the Texture panel in the Properties window;
what are the various settings in the Texture panel of the 'Properties window'.
The 'Properties window' is located on the right hand side of our screen.
We have already seen the first few panels of the 'Properties window' and their settings in the previous tutorial.
Let's see the next panel in the 'Properties window'.
First, we must resize our 'Properties window' for better viewing and understanding.
Left click the left edge of the 'Properties window', hold and drag to the left.
To learn how to resize the Blender windows, see our tutorial - How to Change Window Types in Blender.
Go to the top row of the 'Properties window'.
Left click the Checkered Square icon at the top row of the Properties window.
This is the Texture Panel. Here, we can add a texture to the active material of the active object.
Just below the Texture icon, we can see the links displayed. Cube to White to Tex.
This means that the active object is the cube. White is the cube's active material.
Tex is the White material's active texture. There are three types of textures -
Material Textures, World Textures. And Brush Textures.
We shall see Material textures in this tutorial.
World textures and Brush textures will be covered in later tutorials.
This is the texture slot box. By default, one texture is enabled for the active material. It is highlighted in blue.
Left click the check box at the far right of the highlighted Texture. Now the texture is disabled.
Left click the check box again. It is enabled again. Next to the check box is a vertical scroll bar.
Left click and hold the vertical scroll. Drag your mouse downwards.
Now, you can see all the texture slots available for the current material.
Each slot is represented by a checkered square.
Scroll back to the active texture.
The up and down arrows are used to move the textures up and down in the texture slot box.
Left click the down arrow. The active-texture moves to the second texture slot.
Left click the up arrow. The active-texture moves back to the first slot.
Below the 'up and down' arrows is another black down arrow.
Left click the black down arrow. A menu appears.
Left click Copy Texture Slot Settings.
Left click the second texture slot in the box. It gets highlighted in blue.
Left click the black down arrow again.
Left click Paste Texture  Slot Settings.
A new Texture has appeared in the second texture slot with the same settings as the first texture.
Left click the cross sign at the right of the Texture name bar below the slot box.
The second texture is removed. Its settings are gone as well.
A New button with a plus sign has appeared.
Left click the New button. A new Texture has appeared in the second texture slot.
So, this is another way to add a new texture.
Notice how the checkered square on the left of the second texture has changed to a different image.
A preview window has appeared below. It shows the preview of the active-texture.
Let's rename this texture.
Left click the Texture name bar below the slot box.
Type Bump on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
Left click the checkered square to the left of the name bar. This is the Texture menu.
All textures used in the Scene are listed here.
Below the name bar is the Type bar. By default, every new texture displays the Clouds texture.
Left click Clouds. This is the Type menu.
Here, all types of textures supported by Blender are listed. Wood, Voxel data, Voronoi etc.
To select any texture type, just left click on it. For now, I am keeping the 'Clouds' Texture.
This is the Texture Preview window. There are three display options here.
Texture- by default, this display is always selected.
Left click Material. This shows the preview of the texture over the material.
Left click Both. As the name suggests, both texture and material displays are visible side by side now.
Left click Show Alpha. Now the texture has become transparent.
This is used for materials like glass and water. For now let's switch it off.
Left click Show Alpha again.
Next setting is Influence.
There are various options here that help the texture influence the material in four main areas.
Diffuse, Shading, Specular and Geometry. By default, Color under Diffuse is enabled.
Left click the check-box to the left of the Color bar. Color is now disabled.
The texture color no longer influences the Material Diffuse color.
Go to Geometry. Left click the check-box next to Normal.
Now the Normal of the texture influences the Geometry of the Material.
You can see the result in the preview window.
All over the preview sphere the clouds are spread as small bumps.
Blend controls how the texture blends with the material. By default, it is set as Mix.
Left click Mix. This menu lists all the texture Blend types supported by Blender.
Do you see this pink color bar under RGB to Intensity? This is the default texture color.
Right now it is not influencing the material color because remember we disabled the color option under Influence.
Left click the 'pink color'. A color menu appears.
Here we can select any color for our texture.
For now, let's leave it as pink because we are not using the texture color.
Bump Mapping determines how the normal of the texture affects the Geometry of the material.
Default is the current method of 'bump mapping'.
Left click Default. This menu lists the different methods of 'bump mapping'-
Best quality, Default, Compatible and original.
Left click Compatible. The bump influence is increased.
Next setting is Clouds. Here are various options for the clouds texture.
Greyscale displays the texture in 'greyscale' mode.
Left click Color.
Now the texture in the preview window is displayed in a mix of colors.
But the color has no effect on the material.
Noise determines the distortion of the clouds texture.
Soft noise is the default distortion.
Left click Hard. Now the 'preview window' shows hard black outlines in the 'clouds texture'.
At the same time, the bumps on the material have become deeper. This is hard noise.
Basis is the base or source of the noise in the clouds texture.
Left click Blender Original. Here is the Noise basis menu.
This shows a list of all supported noise bases in Blender.
Left click Voronoi Crackle. You can see the change in the preview window.
So, this is how Noise basis affects the clouds texture.
Size, Nabla and Depth control the characteristics of the noise in the clouds texture.
The last two icons at the top row of the 'Properties panel' are Particles and Physics.
These shall be covered in more advanced tutorials when we use Particles and Physics in our animation.
Go to the 3D-view.
Right click to select the Lamp.
Notice how the icons at the top row of the 'Properties panel' have now changed.
Some icons have been replaced while others have been removed.
Right click Camera  in the 3D-view.
Again, you can see how the icons at the top row of the 'Properties panel' have changed.
This means that the tools in the 'Properties window' are dynamic and depend on the type of active object in the 3D-view.
So, this completes our tutorial on the Properties window.
add a clouds texture to the cube and play around with Size, Nabla and Depth of the Clouds Noise.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Using "this" keyword in java.
About use of "this" keyword
To use "this" keyword with fields
To use this keyword for chaining of constructors.
how to create a constructor in java, using eclipse.
Now we will see the use of this keyword.
Within a constructor, "this" is a reference to the current object.
We can refer any member of the current object, within a constructor, using "this".
Now we will see the use of this keyword with fields.
this keyword helps us to avoid name conflicts.
We can see such an example here.
For that, let us open Eclipse.
Open the Student class we had created in the earlier tutorial.
Comment the default constructor, comment the constructor with 1 parameter.
Also comment the code for creating the first two objects.
Now, notice the parameterized constructor.
the_roll_number and the_name are the arguments passed to the constructor.
roll_number and name are the instance variables.
Now, let me change the arguments to roll_number and name itself.
So inside the constructor we have:
roll_number equal to roll_number and name equal to name.
Now Save and run the file. So press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11.
I am a parameterized constructor
Now come back to the code.
We see 2 warnings in the code.
Hover your mouse over the warning symbol.
We can see The assignment to the variable roll_number has no effect.
And The assignment to the variable name has no effect.
This is because, in the constructor, 'roll_number' and 'name' are local variables.
Local variables are variables that are accessible within the method or block.
Here, 'roll_number' and 'name' will be initialized to 11 and "Raju"
because we have passed the values 11 and "Raju" into the constructor.
But once they come out of the constructor, it is not accessible.
Then the only roll_number and name we know, are the instance variables.
They have been initialized to '0' and null' already once the object is created.
So we got the output as 0 and null.
Now, let us make a small change inside the constructor.
So, type: this dot roll_number equal to roll_number.
And, this dot name equal to name.
Now save and run the file. So press ctrl, S And Ctrl, F11 keys.
This is because this dot roll_number and this dot name refer to the instance variables 'roll_number' and 'name'.
And here roll_number and name are the arguments, passed in the method.
To avoid conflict between local and instance variables we use "this" keyword.
Now, we will see the use of "this" keyword for chaining of constructor.
We can use this keyword inside a constructor to call another one.
The constructors must be in the same class.
This is called explicit constructor invocation.
So, let us come back to the Student class which we created.
Now remove the comments.
Now, comment the part to assign the instance variables to their values in the first two constructors.
Then comment the part which creates the second and third objects.
Now, let us first come to the constructor with no parameters.
After curly brackets type: this within brackets 11 and semicolon.
Inside the second constructor, type: this within brackets 11 comma within double quotes "Raju" semicolon.
Now, Save and Run the file. So, press Ctrl, S and Ctrl , F11.
I am a parameterized constructor
I am a constructor with a single parameter
I am Default Constructor
Now, I will explain the output.
When the object is created, the respective constructor gets called.
The constructor here is the no argument constructor.
The control comes to the first line in the constructor.
It encounters the this within brackets 11 statement.
Hence it calls the constructor that accepts single integer argument.
Then the control comes to this within brackets 11 comma Raju.
Hence it calls the constructor that accepts 1 integer and 1 String argument.
So, this constructor is executed and we get the output as I am a parameterized constructor.
Now the instance variables will be initialized to 11 and Raju as we have passed.
Now, the control goes back to the calling constructor.
So, the second constructor gets executed.
We get the output as I am constructor with a single parameter.
Then, the control goes to the first constructor and executes it.
So, we get output as I am a default constructor.
Then studentDetail method is executed.
So, we get 11 and Raju.
Now, let us make a small change.
Make the this statement the last one in the constructor.
We get a compiler error.
We get the error as:
Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor.
So, we must make it the first line of the constructor.
So, make it the first line of the constructor.
Now we can see that the error has gone.
So, in this tutorial, we learnt:
The use of this keyword with fields.
To use this keyword for chaining constructors
How this keyword should be used within a constructor.
For self assessment, in the Employee class created earlier:
Create a constructor with two parameters.
Use this keyword to initialize the instance variables .
Also, create a constructor with 1 and no parameters.
Try chaining the constructors using this as explained in the tutorial.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on conditional statements in awk.
In this tutorial, we will learn about-  if,  else,  else if in awk.
To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the previous awk tutorials on our website.
You should have familiarity with any programming language like C or C++.
A conditional statement allows us to check a specified condition before performing an action.
Let’s learn how conditional statements like if, else, else-if work in awk.
Like any programming language, the syntax of 'if -else' statement is:
if conditional-expression1 is true then perform action1.
else if conditional-expression2 is true then perform action 2.
A number of else if statements may follow after this.
At the end, if none of the specified conditional expressions are true then perform action n.
The else and else-if portions are optional.
We will use the same awkdemo.txt file that we have used earlier.
Say, we need to give 50% increment in stipend to the students getting more than 8000 rupees.
Let us create an awk file for this condition.
Type the following code as shown, in a text editor and save it as cond dot awk.
The same file is also available in the Code Files link.
In this code, we have set the Output Field Separator as colon.
The first print statement prints the field headings.
Next, the 'if' statement will check whether the value of the 6th field is greater than 8000.
If yes, the second print statement will get executed.
$6 into 1.5 inside this print statement will multiply the 6th field value by 1.5 .
Let’s execute this code now.
Now, type: awk space hyphen capital F pipe symbol within double quotes space hyphen small f space cond dot awk space awkdemo dot txt.
The output shows only one student’s record with the incremented stipend who fulfilled the condition.
Now, suppose the rule changes: 50% increment in stipend for students who get more than 8000 rupees.
Otherwise, give 30% increment.
We need to add an 'else' block.
Switch to the cond dot awk file once again.
Let us add the following line of code.
else press Enter.
print space dollar 2 comma dollar 6 comma dollar 6 into 1.3
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Press the up-arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
Observe the output now.
Let’s change the rules again.
40% increment for student getting more than 4000 rupees.
Switch to the code. Update the code as shown.
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Let me clear the terminal.
Now, press up-arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
This time, notice that the student Mira Nair has got 40% increment.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt about Conditional statements like:
As an assignment, give grades according to the rules:
If mark is greater than equal to 80 but less than 90, grade will be B.
If mark is greater than equal to 70 but less than 80, grade will be C.
If mark is greater than equal to 60 but less than 70, grade will be D.

Welcome to Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany.
Today I have something new to show you.
There is a new video by Joseph and today he is going to show you how to make an image using the sketch effects.
Hi! My name is Joseph and today I am going to show you how to create a sketch effect using gimp 2.4.
To show you the sketch effect, I am going to work with the Layers.
The next thing that I am going do is to rename these layers, So that I can get an idea about which layer I am working on.
So, I select the top layer and then go to Filters >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur.
I move around in the image with the help of the Preview to get a spot where we can see some lines.
And Blur Radius is very important here.
I have created 2 previews here to show you the differences you  get using 30 Blur Radius and 5 Blur Radius.
For this image, I will keep the Blur Radius as 15 and click on OK.
Now we have got a nice blur on the top layer.
So, the next thing we need to do is to invert the colours.
So, go to Colours >> Invert.
Now we go back to our tool box, select the top layer and set its Opacity to 50%.
And we get a nice gray image.
Now we will merge these two layers together by right clicking on the top layer and select Merge Visible Layers and click on Merge.
The next thing I want to do is to increase the contrast in the image and to do that I select the Levels Tool.
As you can see that most of the information in this image is in the middle.
And I have to slide the sliders to that value.
Now I slide the middle slider to the left so that I get the image a little whiter.
and click on OK.
And now you can see that the lines are started to come out but we still got some colours in the image.
So, I go to Colours >> Desaturate and select Luminosity option and now we have got a black and white image.
Now, I select again the Levels Tool and adjust the slider to get more contrast in the image.
Adjust the sliders in such a way that you get a good contrast in the image.
I think this is good.
So, now we have got an image with a good sketch effect.
I think we should make a border to this image.
So, I create a new layer, name it as white and select Layer Fill Type as White and temporarily I decrease the value of opacity so that we can see through the image.
Now I select Rectangle selection tools from the tool box and draw a rough selection into the image.
And adjust the rectangle.
Once we are finished with adjusting the rectangle, go down to the left corner and click on Toggle Quick Mask and we get a black and  white border which can be edited.
We can use Filters to create some interesting effects. So, I go to Filters >> Distorts >> Waves.
And in this box you can see that there are lots of options for creating some interesting borders.
I adjust the sliders so that I get a little wave.
That looks good.
Now I want to add some Blur.
So, go to Filters but I think I should use some different effect.
So, I go to Noise and choose Spread and I set the Horizontal to 22.
So, now go to the Toggle Quick Mask button and click on it.
And you can see here, there are margins area which means that we got a selection.
Now I am going to add a layer mask to that layer and fill it with white for full opacity and there is a selection in the image. We can drag black colour into that selection and make our area there completely transparent.
I go to Select >> None, go back to the layer that we had temporarily set transparent and we will increase the opacity to 100%.
Later on if you want to change the colour of your border, all you have to do is to go to the Colour dialog, select a colour and drag in that layer and you get a different coloured layer.
That was a nice sketch effect and thank you Joseph for this video.
Now let’s look what has happened there.
I have prepared here an image and I have here a gray gradient from black to white and a area filled with white and black.
And I have already doubled the layer which is the first step.
Now I want to invert this image. So, go to Colours >> Invert.
You see that this image is now exactly the opposite and I reduce the Opacity to 50%.
And the whole image is gray that’s because, half of black plus half of white gives gray.
And here, half of white plus half of black also gives gray.
So, next step is to Blur this layer.
So, go to Filters >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur.
I have unblocked this chain here so that I can change only the Vertical blur and not Horizontal blur because the image will get very confusing.
So, this is my desired result and I click on OK.
Now you see here dark gray and light gray lines.
These lines here are the result of blurring of the foreground.
When I zoom in here and enhance the Opacity you see here black, white and in between there is a gradient.
On the other layer we have white and black and now it’s not the exactly opposite.
So, decrease the Opacity and now you can see that on one side it's dark gray and on the other side its medium gray.
Here it's medium gray and here also.
But first let’s look at the trick of the eye.
Here it's definitely darker than this one here. So, I select the Colour Picker and we can see that here it is 128, 128, 128 for Red, Green and Blue and 50% gray and it's medium gray and here it's 127, 127, 127 also 50% gray.
Here, there are little shades which is basically the same colour and we have 127 on this side and 128 on this side.
If we divide 255 by 2 we get either 127 or 128 if you have no floating point.
Now, I have to merge these layers.
So, go to Layer >> Merge down.
So, here get the colour level that Joseph  had in his image and now I can just pull these sliders and make black darker and gray whiter.
You can see a line of variable thickness and if I pull these sliders to left then line gets finer and finer.
So, let's look at the whole image, Shift + Ctrl + E and you see here I have lines instead of the gradient and colour fills I had before.
I hope you  understand this and you can try doing it.
Some images look very good with this effect.
And Joseph’s image was so funny. I love it.
This week I start a new segment at Meet The GIMP.
If you go to the Home page and down there on the right side you find the way to 'Photo group at 23HQ.com'.
And there are lot of your images which I show and from week-week I will  take one of them and say something about it and today I will take this one here.
It is made by Mainzelmann at the fireworks and he asks for comment regarding the white balance and the colours in this image and I think its worth looking it.
I have commented but that was only in German.
Ok. Let’s have a look.
This is his image simply pulled off from the website and dropped here on the tool box and then GIMP opens the image from the web.
I think the sky has to get little darker.
The building here at the bottom is great, that has to stay in the image. But the sky here should be nearly black, not really black like this and perhaps some of this smoke clouds here can be saved.
So, I select the Curves Tool and let’s see what we can do.
You can see here that we have a lot of white colour in this image, here.
The exposure in this image is very good and the values are very well distributed in the histogram and we have black here, you see that's not really black.
We can make this a bit darker here.
So, I can pull this black point up to here.
The black point is definition of black and I now can say this is black.
So you can see that it's the firework, a bit more prominent and I want to make this part of the histogram a bit darker.
So, I place a point here and just pull the curve down.
I have to leave a bit of room here for the building.
I think this is the important part of the building.
So, I pull the curve down here and I can see the building is still there.
Now, this area here is dark and this white; perhaps this is now a bit too white. So I just pull this down.
Let's try something strange.
No, that doesn't work.
Just pull the points out.
I haven't tried this before so little bit of experimenting.
I think this works.
At first looking at the image to make it a bit warmer but now the colours come out very good.
I think this is it for this image.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Installation of LibreOffice Suite.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to install LibreOffice Suite in Windows OS.
To record this tutorial, I'm using:
Let us begin with the installation of LibreOffice Suite.
First, I will open Firefox web browser.
In the address bar, type:  www.LibreOffice.org/download and press Enter.
We are immediately redirected to the Download page.
Here, you can see the Download button to download LibreOffice Suite.
By default, latest version for our OS is displayed here.
In my case, I’m recording on Windows OS. So it shows the latest version of LibreOffice for Windows.
But we can download this software as suitable for our OS version.
How can we change the OS for LibreOffice version? Just click on the link “change”, located just above the Download button.
We are redirected to another page. Here, we can see the Download option for different OS ; select as per your need.
Here, we can also choose the version of LibreOffice Suite that we want to install.
I will choose Windows.
On doing this, we are once again redirected to the Download page.
Note that the default version of LibreOffice and OS is now as per our selection.
Let us click on the Download button.
On doing so, a Save As dialog box opens.
Click on the Save button and the download will start. This may take some time depending upon the internet speed.
When the downloading is complete, go to the Downloads folder. Now, double click on the LibreOffice  setup file.
A dialog Box will open asking Do you want to run this file?
Now the installation wizard will open. Click on NEXT button whenever prompted.
Now, it will ask whether you want a Typical or Custom installation. By default, Typical will be selected. Click on NEXT.
Then click on Install button. The installation will take some time.
Once the installation is complete, click on Finish.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Draw - Basics of Layers and Password Encryption PDF.
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of layers.
You will also learn how to protect a Draw file  using password encryption,
export it as PDF.
Here, we are using:  Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
Let us open the file 'Route Map'.
What are Layers?,Layers are like transparent sheets, placed one on the top of another.
There are three layers to every Draw file.
The "Layout" layer is displayed by default
that is where we create most of our graphics.
The "Controls" layer is used to store control elements such as buttons and forms.
The "Dimension" layer is used to depict dimension lines or measurement lines for complex drawings.
For example, a drawing of a house must contain exact measurements of walls, positions of electrical wiring and so on.
Let’s print three maps that show the route from the 'House' to the 'School'.
Let’s call them Map 1, Map 2 and Map 3.
Map 1 shows all the landmarks in the area.
In Map 2, let’s show all the objects except the two 'Lakes', the 'Stadium' and the 'Commercial Complex'.
In Map 3, let’s show all the objects except the 'Park'.
Do we need to create three separate maps to show these?
No. The Draw provides a solution to this with the help of Layers.
This way, there can be only one map file with many layers of information.
We can print or view a combination of layers using one Draw page.
Let us add some layers to the RouteMap.
Click on Layout layer.
Right-click and select Insert Layer.
The Insert layer dialog-box appears.
In the Name field, type: Layer four.
You can add any title and description that is relevant to your drawing.
Check the boxes “Visible” and “Printable”.
Click OK to exit the dialog-box.
Click on "Layout" layer once again.
On the Draw page, select the map and ungroup it.
Now, let us select the Lakes.
Press the Shift key and select the Stadium and the Commercial complex.
Next, right-click and select Cut.
Then click on “Layer four” layer and paste them.
They are pasted in the same positions as in the Layout layer.
Click Layer Four once again.
Right-click to view the context menu and select Modify Layer.
The Modify Layer dialog-box  appears.
Uncheck the box “Visible”. Click OK.
Objects in Layer Four are no longer visible.
The objects are present physically but are not visible.
Click Layout layer. If the tab is not seen then press the left-arrow button till the Layout layer is visible.
We have our Map 2! In the same manner, we can create Map 3 also.
Create two routes from Home to the School Campus.
In the RouteMap drawing, create each route on a separate layer so that they can be printed as two different maps, each displaying only one route.
Let us now learn how to export the file as a PDF and also password protect our Draw file.
First, let’s save the Draw file “RouteMap” as a 'PDF'.
From the main menu, select File and click “Export as PDF”.
The PDF dialog-box appears.
First, let us select the “General” options.
Click the “General” Tab.
Under Range, let us select All as we are converting all the pages in the Draw file to 'PDF'.
Under Images, we shall select “JPEG compression”.
This is the most common format that is used for compression.
Now, click on the Initial View tab.
We will keep the default values displayed in the dialog-box.
Now, click on the Links tab.
We may have inserted links in the Draw file.
Again, let’s keep the default values set for Links.
Now, let’s assign a password to protect the 'PDF' document.
To do so, click on the “Security” tab.
Click on the Set open password button.
The Set Open Password dialog-box appears.
In the field “Password”,  type any password with which you want to protect your file.
I will set my password as “Protect101”.
In the field Confirm, I will re-type my password- “Protect101”. Click OK.
Next, let’s set the permission password to print or modify the document.
Click on the Set permission password button.
In the field Password, type the password of your choice.  I will type ProtectAgain0.
In the field Confirm, I will retype the password ProtectAgain0  and click OK.
Notice that permissions for Printing and Changes are active now.
It is always a good practice to set passwords with a minimum of six characters, including numbers and special characters.
Under Printing, select the option Not Permitted.
The 'PDF' can be printed only if the correct password is provided, else it cannot be printed.
Under Changes, select the option Not Permitted.
The Password can be edited only if the correct password is provided, else it cannot be modified.
Now, let us click the Export button at the bottom.
The Export dialog-box appears.
From the left panel, under Places, click on the location where you want to save your file. I will choose Desktop.
Under File type, click PDF - Portable Document Format.
And click on the Save button.
The Draw file is converted to a PDF file and saved on the Desktop.
Let us switch to the Desktop now.
On the Desktop, double-click on the RouteMap PDF file.
The Enter password dialog-box opens.
In the "Password" field, let's type the wrong password Protect111.
Click on the Unlock Document button.
You will notice that the password' field is cleared and we are prompted to enter the password once again.
In the Password field, let’s type the correct password "Protect101".
Click on the Unlock Document button. The PDF file opens.
We have converted our Draw file into PDF and successfully password-protected it!
Here we have learnt: * the basics of layers.
How to convert a Draw file into a PDF
How to protect it using  password encryption.
Create another PDF of the "RouteMap" file.
In the PDF dialog-box, change “Initial View” options.
Observe what happens.
Check all the options for “User Interface”.
Set permission passwords.
Print this PDF.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on parameterized constructor in java.
In this tutorial we will learn:
About a parameterized constructor.
And to create a parameterized constructor.
how to create a default constructor in java using eclipse.
What is a parameterized constructor?
A constructor that has parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
It can have one or more than one parameters.
Let us now create a parameterized constructor.
So in the eclipse, I have   Student.java file.
We created this file in the previous tutorial.
Now, inside the constructor we will give the variables their default value.
So roll_number is equal to zero instead of ten.
And name is equal to null instead of Raman.
Then type System dot out dot println "I am a  default constructor".
So, we have created a constructor with no parameters.
In java, such constructor is also called a default constructor.
Now we will create another constructor.
Inside parenthesis int the_roll_number comma String the_name.
So, what we have done is declared a constructor with parameters.
The name of the constructor is  Student that is the class name.
Inside the parentheses, we have given two parameters to the constructor.
We can give any number of parameters to the constructor.
Now, inside curly brackets type:
System dot out dot println "I am a parameterized constructor".
Then, roll_number is equal to the_roll_number.
And name is equal to the_name.
So, we have created a   constructor with parameters.
Now let's call this  constructor.
So, in the main method type: student stu2 equal to new student within parentheses 11 comma in double quotes Raju.
Let's call the studentDetail  method.
So, type: stu2.studentDetail.
We see the output on the console.
The default constructor is called first.
It initializes the variables to their default values.
Then the parameterized constructor is called.
It initializes the variables to the values that are passed as the arguments.
That is 11 and Raju.
Let us see how the parameterized constructor works.
When we call the parameterized constructor, we pass two values  to it.
These are called arguments.
The value 11 is copied to the parameter the_roll_number.
And  the  value Raju is copied  to the parameter the_name.
Then the value of the_roll_number is assigned to roll_number.
And the value of the_name is assigned to name.
Hence,  in the  output  we see 11  and  Raju.
Let us see the common errors when we call a parameterized constructor.
Suppose, we pass a single argument to the constructor.
So remove Raju.
We get an error. It states that “The constructor Student with parameter (int) is undefined.”
So, the number of arguments must match the number of parameters.
Here we can retype Raju and resolve the error.
Alternatively, what we can  do is define another constructor with a single parameter.
Let us  do that.
So, Student within parentheses int r_ number.
Inside curly brackets, type:   System dot out dot println
"I am a constructor with a single parameter".
Then roll_number is equal to r_ number.
Save the file.
We see that the error is resolved  when we define the constructor.
Let's  Run the program.
On the console we see that the roll number is assigned the value 11.
While name is null since the constructor takes only one argument.
Let us now call back our constructor with two parameters.
So, type Student stu3 is equal to new Student.
11 comma Raju.
Then Stu3 dot studentDetail.
We get an error.
It states that “The constructor Student String comma String is undefined.”
So even the data type of the argument must match with that of the parameter.
So now remove the quotes and Save the file.
Now we do not see an error.
So  Run the program.
In the output we see three constructors.
The first one is the default constructor.
The second one is the Constructor with one parameter.
And this third one is the Constructor with two parameters.
This is how we create parameterized constructor in java.
Why constructor?
The variables in a class must be initialized each time an instance is created.
It can be tedious to initialize all the variables.
So, java allows objects to initialize themselves when they are created.
This is performed through the use of a constructor.
So in this tutorial, we have learnt:
To create parameterized constructor.
Functionality of parameterized constructor.
And the advantage of using constructor.
For self assessment, create a class Employee.
Create constructors with different number of parameters.
It is supported by the National mission on Education through ICT, MHRD, Government of India.

Today we'll talk about simple animation.
The package of GIMP animation is called GAP or GIMP Animation Package which can do a lot about Animations, Films and Movies.
But we'll cover that later.
The oldest animations in Germany are called Daumenkino or Front Cinema.
And in English it's called Flip Book or Flick Book.
This book contains a lot of images which are nearly the same but slide modifications from page to page and if you flick through them, you get  little moving picture.
This video here, is an animation too and you are looking at a slide show with 25 images per second.
Here are two advertise, this is mine and this one from Rob which show animated gif.
I want to improve my advertisement here.
I want to show in my advertisement the Meet The GIMP logo.
Now, I have to save this image to my desktop and I have to successfully create an animation.
So, now I steal my own image and save it on my desktop.
I open this image with the GIMP.
Just pull it over to the tool box and here it is.
Let me enlarge this a bit here.
Basically there is no animation in this image but there is a stack of eight layers in the layer dialog.
And on the top you can see that this is a gif image which is indexed and has eight layers of 80 by 80 pixels.
This image is made out of 256 different colours.
And to look at these colours go to Dialogs and Colormap.
Here you can see the colours which are used in this image and there is lot of blue and some other colours and each colour has an index and the HTML notation.
So, 'gif' images are indexed and not 'rgb' images and so they have only one limited colour available.
Now let's look at the frames here.
You can see that the 1st layer is named as Background and in bracket it is in milliseconds i.e 5 Seconds.
So, this image is shown for 5 seconds and then follows the frames 2,3,4 with 100 milliseconds and there is an option of replace.
To see the frames, I just press the Shift key and hold and click on the eye here and all the other frames are made invisible.
And now I can stack them on the top, here.
There is a draw back of using the index colours.
You can see lot of spots in here because these tile has only 256 different colours available.
So, this here is my background image.
And this is the other one and also the other image I used in this animation and this drawing was  made by the people instead of following the lesson and I have used it with his permission.
And the rest of the images are simply mixtures of the other images to get a smooth way from one to the other.
To recreate this animation, I have to take two images out of this stack which is very easy.
Just click on the thumbnail here and hold the mouse button and draw it up to the toolbox.
And here is my first image.
Now click here and this one here is my second image.
So, I have these two images here and I can close my original animation and I don’t want to save anything of it.
Now I wanted to include the Meet the GIMP logo.
Just pull it over to the tool box and here it is.
I have to rescale it down to 80 by 80 pixels and then I have to include white colour as my background because black would be too harsh with this image.
And to do that, I just add a new layer, fill it with  white and pull it down and now I have white as my background.
Right click into the layer dialog  and select Flatten image.
Now I have a flat Meet The GIMP  logo on white.
Now, go to Image, Scale Image  and I want to have 80 pixels and in Interpolation, Cubic  is good. Click on  Scale.
And now the image is rescaled but it is way too soft.
After rescaling, you have to sharpen it.
So, I go to Filters >> Enhance  >> Sharpen.
I think, I should go fairly high with the sharpness.
I think this is good.
Now I have three images waiting for becoming one animation.
One thing I have nearly forgotten is saving these basic images.
The 1st one is this here, Meet The GIMP and I Save it as "mtg80.xcf".
And this one here too.
Other way to access  menu is, right click into the image and go to Image >> Mode and RGB.
Then go to File and Save As.
I will use this image as my base.
So, I save it again and this time as the copy.
And I call it "avatar.xcf".
Yes, I want to replace it, I have done that before.
Go to File, Open.
So, here this is my basic image.
And the 1st thing I want to do is, blend this image with Meet The GIMP Logo.
And for that, I make a copy of this one and mix it with the logo.
I select this image by clicking and pulling this into my tool box and here I have my layer. And now, I select the logo and pull it over to this image and you get a scrap layer which is untitled and it will never be saved.
Now I have here two layers with my images.
And I want to have 3 steps between these 2 layers.
For doing that I choose a transparency of let's say about 25%.
Now, I flatten this image and pull it to my "avatar.xcf" image.
I'll change these names later on.
I go back to the untitled image, go to Edit and Undo.
Now I set the transparency to about 50%.
Right click on the layer and select Flatten image and before pulling this, I just rename the layer as frame X and in bracket I type 100 milliseconds.
Now I pull this to "avatar.xcf" and go back to my image.
I press Ctrl + Z and change the Opacity of the top layer to say something about 75%.
Right click on the layer and select Flatten image.
I pull this layer to this image.
And that’s it for this animation step.
Now, I have to pull the logo to this image and here I have my first 3 layers of blending.
And now I just close the scrap layer here and don’t save it.
Now we’ll look how this has worked out.
But before that I save my work here.
And now I go to Filters >> Animation and Playback.
Here is my animation.
I click on Play.
First I have to change the names of these layers before playing it.
You can rename the layers the same way as with the lot of other image word processing options.
Just mark the text, press Ctrl + C and double click on the next layer and press Ctrl + V and change the necessary stuff.
Now all the frames have their proper names.
So I go back to my image, select Filters >> Animation >> Playback and let's look at this here.
You see the basic image.
And it is transformed to the other image but it is very quick.
It could be little bit slower.
So I’ll change the timing to say 200 milliseconds.
So again Filters >> Animation >> Playback.
I think this is better.
The last thing to do is index this image and save it as a 'gif' image. And this is easily done.
Just go to File >> Save As and then change the Name extension to 'gif' and click on Save.
Then I get an option dialog.
And 'gif' cannot handle these layers here.
And it can only handle animation frames.
So, I want to save it as Animation.
'gif' can handle only greyscale or indexed images.
So, I want to convert it to index result.
These are the default settings I found. They are good enough for my stuff and I can change it but I don’t think it's necessary.
So, I click on Export.
Here you can see Created With GIMP and Loop forever.
In Frame disposal, I want to replace One frame per layer.
And these other options are unchecked, so I leave them unchecked. Because if I want to change the timings to 5000 or 2000 milliseconds then I can do it.
Now click on Save and we will look at the result.
And for that, we'll not use GIMP but Mozilla.
In Mozilla it works as expected.
Good bye up to next week.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create Action Object Tools in GeoGebra.
In this tutorial we will learn about free and dependent Objects.
To record this tutorial, I am using;
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with GeoGebra interface. For the prerequisite GeoGebra tutorials, please visit this site.
In this tutorial we will use tangents to a circle tool created in the previous tutorial.
To practise this tutorial you need to download the zip file given in the Code files link.
Extract the downloaded zip file.Locate tangents-circle.ggt file in the extracted folder.
I have already downloaded and extracted the file to my Desktop.
I will right-click on it and Open With GeoGebra.
Click on Tangents to a circle tool and click two points in the Graphics view.
Tangents to a circle are drawn in the Graphics view.
Now I will explain about Free and Dependent Objects.
Let us complete the figure.
Click on the Intersect tool. Mark points of intersection of the tangents to the circle.
Using the Segment tool we will join A C, A D and A B.
In the Algebra view, note that segment AC is equal to segment AD.
Now let's measure the angles at the point of contact of the tangents to the circle.
Click on the Angle tool and click on the points B, C, A. and then click on the points A, D, B.
Observe that the angles alpha and beta are 90 degrees.
This is because at the point of contact, tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius.
In the Algebra view, click on the arrow triangle named as Toggle Style Bar.
Auxillary Objects, Sort Objects by drop-down and fx drop-down appear.
Click on Sort Objects by drop-down.Sort by menu opens.
This menu has, Dependency, Object Type, Layer and Construction Order check-boxes.
By default, Object Type check-box is selected.
In other operating systems a different check-box may be selected.
Let us select Dependency check-box.
Note that only points A and B are under Free Objects. All other objects are under Dependent Objects.
You can select other check-boxes and see how the objects are sorted.
Now we will learn how to create a check-box.
Click on the Check Box tool and click in the Graphics view.
Check Box to Show/hide Objects dialog box opens.
In the Caption text box, I will type Angles.
From the Select objects drop-down, let us select Angle alpha and Angle beta.
Then click on Apply button in the box.
Angles check-box appears in the Graphics view.
Let us click on Move tool to avoid clicking of other objects in the Graphics view.
Angles check-box is shown as a Boolean Value a in the views.
Using this check-box, we can show or hide the angles alpha and beta.
In the Algebra view, Boolean Value is true when the angles are shown.
Boolean Value becomes false when they are hidden.
Now we will insert an input box.
Click on the Input Box tool and click in the Graphics view.
Input Box appears in the Graphics view.
In the box, type the Caption as Circle.
In the Linked Object drop-down, select circle c. And click on OK button in the box.
Circle input box, along with its coordinates, appears in the Graphics view.
Click on Move tool to select it.
In the input box, type B in place of A and press Enter.
The tangents, angles and all related objects disappear.
Position of the circle has also changed
This happens because all the objects are dependent on point A.
Click on Undo button to undo the changes
Now, we will learn how to create a button.
Click on the Button tool and click in the Graphics view.
The Button dialog box opens.
Type Caption as Value.
In GeoGebra Script  box  type the following script.
Now I will explain the script.
This line will change the position of the coordinates of A to A-1
Similarly this line will change the poistion of the coordinates of B to B+2.
This line will set the colour of segment j to blue.
This line will set the colour of segment h to green.
This line will set the colour of segment i to red.
Click on the OK button at the bottom.
Value button appears in the Graphics view.
Select the Move tool and Click on value button.
Observe the changes in the Graphics view.
Observe that the coordinates of point A and point B have changed.
The colours of the segments have changed accordingly.
Click on Zoom Out tool and click in the Graphics veiw to zoom out.
I will click the Value button again.
Now we will combine action tools and see what happens.
I have opened a new GeoGebra window.
Click on the Slider tool and click in the Graphics view.
The Slider dialog box opens.
By default, Number radio button is selected with Name as a.
We will set the Min value to 1, Max to 10 and Increment to 1.
Click on OK button at the bottom. A number slider a appears in the Graphics view.
Now click on Regular Polygon tool and click two points in the Graphics view.
Regular Polygon text box opens. In the Vertices text box, type a and click OK in the box.
Notice in the Algebra view, under Polygon we have poly1 undefined.
As a we drag the slider, notice that polygons with different sides appear.
Now we will insert an input box.
Click on Input Box tool and click in the Graphics view.
Input dailog box opens.
Type the Caption as Number of sides in the box.
Select a=1 in the Linked Object drop-down. Click on OK button in the text box.
Number of sides input box appears in the Graphics view.
In the Algebra view, uncheck the number slider a=1 to hide the slider.
In the Number of sides input box, type 4 and press Enter. You will see a square.
Likewise, you can type any number between 3 to 10 and see the respective polygon.
Let us summarise.
We have also learnt to,

The Visible setting determines whether the course will be shown along with other courses or not.
A hidden course is visible only to those assigned to the course, like- Admin, Course creator, Teacher, Manager.
We will leave this setting as it is, for now.
Next comes the Course start date.
If the course begins on a particular date like semester start date, select that in the start date.
This means the course will not be visible to the students till the start date.
Course end date, by default, is enabled and set to the same date that the course is created.
Let me disable it by clicking on the checkbox. This would mean that the course will never end.
However, if there is an end date for the course, you can enable the checkbox here.
Important note: The course will not be visible to the students after the selected end date.
Course ID number is similar to Category ID number.
This is for admin users to identify the course with offline courses.
If your college uses IDs for courses, then you can use that course ID here.
This field is optional and is not displayed anywhere on the website. I am going to leave this as blank.
Next, under Description, we can see 2 fields: Course Summary and Course Summary files.
Course summary is an optional but important field. That is because the course summary text is also scanned when a user performs a search.
Listing topic names is a good idea here.
Course summary is also displayed along with the list of courses.
Course summary files must be uploaded in Course summary files field.
By default, only jpg, gif and png file types are allowed as course summary files.
Course format refers to the way resources and activities are organized for students.
There are 4 options in the Format dropdown -
There are courses that run week by week.
If your course is like that, then select Weekly format.
Moodle will create a section for each week of the course, with a clear start date and an end date.
There are courses that run topic wise. If your course is like that, then select Topics   format.
Moodle will create a section for each topic of the course.
The default for this field is Topics format. We will let it remain as it is.
The number of sections, by default, is 4.
If you have your course divided in more or less than 4 topics, change this field as required.
We will discuss the other formats in later tutorials.
Let’s leave the rest of the options as they are.
We are redirected to the Enrolled Users page. We will learn about user enrollment in a later tutorial.
For now, we have successfully created our first course Calculus under the category Mathematics.
While we are on this course page, notice that the menu on the left has changed.
The navigation menu on the left has menus related to the course we created.
Click on the course name Calculus on the left.
We can see that 5 topics are visible here. They are named Topic 1, Topic 2 and so on.
Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page.
Then click on Edit settings.
We can make changes to the previous settings on this page.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Save and display button.
We will explore the other sub-menus under the gear menu later.
Let us now change the structure of our course a little bit.
Click on Site administration.
Click on Mathematics category to see the course we created. Notice 3 icons on the right of the course.
Hover over the icons to see what they are.
The gear icon is for editing a course. The delete or trash icon is for deleting a course.
And, the eye icon is for hiding a course.
A hidden course will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.
We can click on the gear icon to the right of the course name, to edit the course settings.
I want to modify the Course Summary and add Binomials to the existing topics.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and this time click on the Save and return button.
Here is a small assignment for you: create a new course Linear Algebra under the category Mathematics.
Hide this course for now.
Mention the following topics in course summary: Linear equations, Matrices and Vectors.
Pause the tutorial and continue when done with the assignment.
We now have 2 courses under Mathematics: Calculus and Linear Algebra.
Notice that a new icon has appeared next to the courses now.
The up and down arrows are to re-arrange the order of the courses.
We can also change the order using the drag and drop feature.
Both these courses are for 1st year students.
Check the checkbox to the left of the 2 courses in order to select them.
Then in the drop-down Move selected courses to, select Mathematics / 1st year Maths.
And click on the Move button.
We get a success message -Successfully moved 2 courses into 1st year Maths.
Note that the number of courses under Mathematics has become 0 and that under 1st year Maths is 2.
Click on 1st year Maths sub-category.
We can see our courses listed under this subcategory.

Welcome to a presentation on the Guidelines for recording and narration of spoken tutorials.
Please listen to the Introduction to Spoken tutorials, available at
Creation of a tutorial starts with writing a script.
The script needs to be validated before recording.
Only after the script is validated & approved, should you record the tutorial.
Recording of a tutorial consists of two simultaneous activities-  Narration &  Screen casting.
There are certain things you need to keep in mind before starting to record.They are as follows -
If a laptop is used then to charge the battery & disconnect the power chord. Otherwise, there could be humming noise or echoing.
Switch off the fan before recording.
This also helps in eliminating external noise.
Let us see a tutorial with external noise. I have saved some files which demonstrate this.
The humming noise may not be obvious to you if you do not use the head phone.
Turn off mobiles. Silent-mode also can introduce disturbance.
Let us see an example with a cell phone on 'silent-mode'.
You do not need a pin-drop silence studio to create good spoken tutorials.
to cut out the external noise like birds & traffic.
Let us see a honking example.We will now present some guidelines for this tutorial.Ensure that the terminal font is large. Use a minimum of 20 point.
Let us see examples of small & large fonts. Small font results in poor quality videos.
I should show you a video which has big fonts.Here is how the font needs to look like while recording.
Use a minimum of 24 point font size on slides. I am using 32 point font size implemented by beamer command of 17 pt.
Un-maximized windows place them in overlapping manner. This will allow easy switching from one window to another.
You can see window selection easily.
For the current tutorial, that I am recording, I have placed the windows in an overlapping manner.You can see that switching of windows is easy & also you can see selection of windows.This is the 'PDF' file, this is the  internet browser & this is  the Sample folder.
you can even opt to place the windows in a different manner as we can see now. In this tutorial on latex,this is the terminal, this is the editor & this is the 'pdf' file.Now, we will present guidelines on what to do while recording.
Position the mic at a fixed distance from your mouth. This will keep the audio volume consistent.
Let us see what will happen if you do not follow this rule. I shall advance it now.Now we can hear it louder. While recording, use headset with mic input.
At this point, I would like to talk about accent: speak clearly. Speak naturally without putting on an accent.
Let us see an example of  artificial accent- "of the basic functions to create a new file, go to the  menu".Ideally, record the tutorial in one go to get uniform tone throughout the recording.But some processes involve long delays. If so, use the  pause feature of the screen casting software. This will reduce the capture of unnecessary footage.
No one gets the recording right in the first go. So, we recommend  a sample recording for a couple of minutes.Submit it to spoken tutorial team for feedback. Only after approval should you do the final recording .
For more details on the guideline on narration, please go through this wiki page.
Please  make sure you go through guidelines on screen casting too.For recording, we recommend  the use of free & open source applications like Record my desktop on Linux Camstudio on Windows.
To know how to use record my desktop, please go to our website:
To know how to use Camstudio on Windows, please go here.It is available in many languages.
For a self verification, please go  through the checklist given here.
A complete spoken tutorial goes through a quality check by-A novice,The Spoken tutorial admin team,And then by an Expert.
A novice is a person who is new to the particular foss.Novice tests the tutorial by following the instructions given in the tutorial.If the novice encounters bugs, they are rectified by the creator.
The spoken tutorial admin team checks if- the parameters, the audio quality, the video quality are according to the standards.
The admin team of spoken tutorial checks against the criteria given in this checklist. An expert checks for the criteria given in this checklist.
If the expert suggests changes, the creator incorporates the changes and makes the tutorial better for learning.
In this tutorial, I have shed light on what needs to be done before, during & after the recording & how to verify & validate the tutorial once it is created.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Guidelines for Recording and narration.

Welcome to this tutorial on Measurements and Labeling in Jmol Application.
Create models of carboxylic acid and nitroalkane.
Label atoms in a model with symbol and number.
Measure bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles.
To follow this tutorial, you should know
how to create and edit molecular models  in Jmol Application.
If not, watch the relevant tutorials available on our website.
Jmol version 12.2.2 and
Java version 7.
Let's go through the steps on how to build a carboxyl group using this animation.
As an example, we will create a model of Ethanoic acid, commonly known as Acetic acid.
We will begin with a model of Ethane.
We have to convert one of the methyl groups to a carboxyl group.
Substitute two hydrogens attached to the same carbon atom with hydroxy group.
Delete hydrogens attached to one of the oxygen and Carbon.
Convert Carbon-Oxygen bond to a double-bond.
Methyl group is converted to a Carboxyl group.
Observe that Ethane is converted to Ethanoic acid.
We will follow the above steps and create the model of Ethanoic acid in Jmol application.
This is a model of Ethane on Jmol panel.
Let us convert a methyl group to a carboxyl group.
Select oxygen from the Modelkit menu.
Click on the hydrogens attached to the same carbon atom.
Now, check against Delete atom option in the modelkit menu.
Delete the hydrogen attached to the oxygen.
And also, delete hydrogen attached to the carbon.
Then, let us introduce a double-bond between carbon and oxygen.
So, check double option in the modelkit menu
and click on the bond connecting carbon and oxygen.
We have a model of Acetic acid on screen.
Do the energy minimization to optimize the structure.
We will follow a similar strategy to create a nitro group.
Here is the Jmol panel with a model of ethane.
Now, let us convert this molecule to nitro-ethane.
Click on the modelkit menu and check against Nitrogen.
Click on the hydrogen atom in the ethane molecule.
Nitrogen atom is represented as blue sphere.
Next, we will substitute two hydrogens attached to the nitrogen with a hydroxy group.
Click on the modelkit menu and check against Oxygen (O).
Then click on the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen.
Delete the hydrogens attached to the oxygen atoms.
Open modelkit menu and check against delete atom.
Click on the hydrogen attached to the oxygen atoms.
Now, we will introduce a double-bond between nitrogen and oxygen atoms.
Check the “double” option in the modelkit menu.
Click on the bond connecting nitrogen and oxygen atoms.
This is a model of nitroethane on the panel.
As an assignment-,Create models of 1-butanoic acid and ethylacetate.
Optimize the structure by doing energy minimization and
Save the image.
Let's go back to the Jmol panel.
This is the model of 1-butanoic acid on screen.
Let us learn to label the atoms in the model.
We do this with symbols corresponding to the element and number.
Open the Display menu and select Label from the scroll down menu.
Select “Symbol” option to label all the atoms with the symbol corresponding to the element.
"Name” option will give both symbol and the number.
"Number" option will give only numbering of atoms.
One can erase the labels from the model using the "None" option.
We can also use the Pop-up menu to do all the above modifications.
Right-click on the panel to open the Pop-up menu and check the various options.
Distance between any two atoms in a molecule can be measured using Tools menu.
Before we measure, open the modelkit menu and click on minimize.
Energy minimization is now done and the model is in the most stable conformation.
Now, click on Tools menu, select Distance Units.
Select options from the sub-menu according to the requirement.
For example, I will choose Angstrom.
So, the bond lengths I measure, will be in Angstrom units.
Click on Rotate molecule icon and bring the cursor to the panel.
I will measure the distance between atoms 9 and 4.
First, double-click on the starting atom which is atom number 9.
To fix the measurement, double-click on the ending atom which is atom number 4.
The bond length is now displayed on the screen.
Let's do some more measurements of bond lengths.
Let's measure the bond-length between carbon and oxygen double-bond.
So, double-click on atom number 5 and bring the cursor to atom number 7 and double-click on it.
Similarly, let's measure the carbon and oxygen single-bond distance.
So, double-click on atom number 5 and bring the cursor to atom number 6 and double-click on it.
We can see that on the panel all the bond lengths are displayed.
We can also measure bond-angles and dihedral angles in a model.
For example- we will measure the bond angle between atoms 9, 4 and 1.
Double-click on atom number 9 and then click on atom 4.
To fix the angle measurement, double-click on atom number 1.
We can see the bond-angle displayed on the screen.
Let's measure another bond-angle, say, between atoms 1, 5 and 6.
Double-click on atom number 1, click on atom number 5 and lastly double-click on atom number 6.
Measurement of torsional or dihedral angle involves 4 atoms.
So, we will choose atoms 8, 4, 1 and 2.
For measurement of dihedral angle, first double-click on atom number 8.
Click on the atom number 4 and then on atom number 1.
And lastly, to fix the dihedral angle measurement, double-click on atom number 2.
We can see the dihedral angle measurement displayed on the screen.
Values of all measurements made, can be viewed in a tabular form.
Click on “Click atom to measure distances” icon in the tool bar.
Measurements dialog-box opens on the panel.
It has a list of all the measurements made so far.
We can now save the image and exit the application.
Let's summarize:
In this tutorial, we have learnt to-
Create models of carboxylic acid and nitroalkane.
Label atoms in a model with symbol of the element and number.
Measure bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles.
For the assignment-
Create models of molecules with single, double and triple bonds.
Measure bond lengths between the carbon atoms.
And compare them.
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of:
Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS
We will also require some external components such as:

Hello Everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on How to Dub using Audacity.
In this tutorial, we will learn to dub or record an audio using Audacity.
To record this tutorial I am using
Audacity version 2.1.2
I have already installed Audacity 2.1.2 on my Linux system.
For more details, refer to the Translation and Dubbing Series on our website
Now let us open Audacity to dub or record a script.
If you are a Windows user, click on Start Menu and type Audacity in the search box.
Click on Audacity from the displayed list.
This will open an empty Audacity project on your screen.
If you are in a Ubuntu Linux, click on Dash Home.
Type Audacity in the Search Box
This will open an empty Audacity project on your screen.
In the main Menu bar, we can see various options.
We will learn about some of these in detail, as we go along.
Below the main Menu bar, we will see the VCR controls such as
This is also called as Transport Toolbar.
Next to this, we will find the Audacity Tools Toolbar.
It has Selection Tool and Time Shift Tool, which we will use in this tutorial.
By default, the Selection Tool is active.
At the bottom left of the Audacity window, we can see the Project Rate.
Low Project Rate will ensure low file size of the final mp3 file.
As an example, I will use a Hindi script to record.
I will be using these noted timings while editing the audio track later.
To practise alongside, the same script has been provided in the Code Files link of this tutorial.
First I will play the original English tutorial named as ’’What is Spoken Tutorial’’-A two minute overview.
---Add the audio----
Let me stop here
Now I am going to dub this into Hindi language using Audacity.
Switch to Audacity again.
To record, click on the Record button in the Transport Toolbar and narrate the script.
Click on the Pause button in the Transport toolbar to pause the recording.
We can also press the P key on the keyboard, to pause while recording.
Remember to give a pause for 1 or 2 seconds in between two sentences.
Continue to narrate the script.
Now, click on the STOP button in the Transport toolbar to stop the recording.
You may have noticed that there was a loud noise while narrating the sentence. So I had to repeat it.
I will teach you how to rectify this problem later in the series.
Now, look at the Tracks.
The spikes are the waveforms of the audio.
If there is only one track, then the audio is recorded in Mono mode.
And if there are 2 tracks, then the audio is recorded in Stereo mode.
This will be mentioned explicitly in the Label area on the left panel.
By default, the recording mode is set to Stereo.
We have recorded in Stereo mode, so we can see two tracks over here.
But we can also set Mono mode as the default mode.
Click on the Audio Track.
In the Main menu, go to the Tracks option.
Click on the option Stereo Track to Mono.
Let us revert back to Stereo Track by pressing Ctrl + Z keys.
Now let’s record further in the same file.
Ideally, we should record in one go so that we get a single audio track. Now, let me adjust the track for a better view.
Click on the Selection Tool.
Click at the end of the previous recording on the Audio Track.
Now, click on the Record button to start the recording again and narrate the next sentence.
Add the  audio
Click on the Stop button to stop the recording.
Please note.
Once we press Stop button and restart recording, the audio clip will always appear on a new track. Let me again adjust the track for a better view.
Next, we will learn how to merge all these audio tracks into a single track.
Choose Time Shift Tool.
Select the audio clip from the second track by clicking on it.
Drag-and-drop it at the end of the first audio track.
Notice here the 2 clips appear to be merged.
To merge 2 audio clips, simply click on the joint between the clips.
Now we can move the whole clip wherever we want.
Notice here - the second audio track is now empty.
We can remove it by clicking on the 'X' button in the Label area.
Observe that the track has been removed.
Once we are done with the recording, we should save the file.
To do so, go to the File menu and click on Save Project.
A dialog box will open. And it will ask for a filename.
I am giving the filename as "Hindi-What-is-ST".
Next it will ask for the location where it has to be saved.
I will choose Desktop and then click on Save.
Note: we have only saved the project file.
The audio is not yet in the format that can play in any audio/video player.
Now close this project file.
Next, let us see how to open an existing project file.
On the Desktop, we had saved the file Hindi-What-is-ST.aup.
Whenever we save the Audacity Project file, it will also create a folder named as Projectname_data.
In my case it is Hindi-What-is-ST_data.
This folder contains the Audacity data for each project.
If this folder is deleted or moved to another location, then we cannot open and edit the Audacity project.
Double-click on Hindi-What-is-ST.aup to open it.
You can see the audio track inside.
Now let us close this project file.
Let me summarize the tutorial for you.
In this tutorial we have learnt how to-
Locate audio tracks - Stereo Track and Mono Track
Convert from Stereo Track to Mono Track
Merge 2 audio clips
Save the project as .aup file
As an assignment, Refer to any Timed-script on the Spoken Tutorial website.
Record an audio file using that script and save the project.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Theorems in GeoGebra.
In this tutorial we will state and prove,
To record this tutorial, I am using;
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with GeoGebra interface.
Let us state the Pythagoras theorem.
The square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite to the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
I have already opened the GeoGebra interface.
We will begin with the drawing of a semicircle.
Click on the Semicircle through 2 Points tool.
Then click to mark two points in the Graphics view.
Using the Point we will mark another point C on the semicircle c.
Now let us draw a triangle ABC using the points on the semicircle.
Click on the Polygon tool and draw triangle ABC
Here we are using semicircle to draw the triangle.
This is because we need the measure of one angle to be 90 degree.
Let us measure the angles of the triangle.
Click on the Angle tool and click inside the triangle. Here angle ACB is 90 degrees.
Now we will hide the semicircle c.
In the Algebra view under Conic, click on the blue dot against c.
We will draw three squares using the sides of the triangle.
For that click on the Regular Polygon tool and then click on the points C, B.
The Regular Polygon text box opens with a default value 4.
Click on OK button at the bottom.
If you click on the points B, C, the square is drawn in the opposite direction.
Let us undo the process by clicking on the Undo button.
Now click on the points A, C.  And then click the OK button in the text box that appears.
Similarly click on the points B, A. And then click the OK button in the text box that appears.
Now we have three squares that represent the Pythagorean triplets.
Now we will use Zoom Out tool to see the diagram clearly.
Now we will find the area of these squares.
Click on the Area tool and click on poly1, poly2 and poly3 respectively.
The areas of the respective squares are displayed.
Using the Move tool drag the labels to see them clearly.
Now we will check if the area of poly1 + area of poly 2 is equal to area of poly3.
In the input bar  type poly1+ poly2  and press Enter.
In the Algebra view a Number d,  shows the value of area of poly3.
Hence Pythagoras theorem has been proved.
Now I will explain the Construction Protocol for pythagoras theorem.
Construction Protocol shows the step by step construction of the diagram as an animation.
To view the animation, click on View menu and select Construction Protocol check box.
Construction Protocol view opens next to Graphics view.
I will drag the boundary of Graphics view view to see the Construction Protocol view.
This view has a table with some columns. Below the table we have the animation controls.
Now click on the Play button.
Watch the step by step construction of the figure as an animation.
Now we will prove the Mid-point theorem.
The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half of it.
I have opened a new GeoGebra window.
Let us draw a triangle ABC using Polygon tool.
Now we will find the mid-points of the sides AB and AC.
Click on the Midpoint or Center tool. Then click on the sides AB and AC.
Using the Line tool, draw a line through points D and E.
Now we will draw a line parallel to segment AB.
For this, click on the Parallel Line tool and click on segment AB.
Then, click on point C.  Line g parallel to segment AB is drawn.
Notice that lines f and g intersect at a point.
Using the Intersect tool, let us mark the point of intersection as F.
Now we need to measure angles F C E and D A E.
Click on the Angle tool and click on the points  F, C, E and D, A, E.
Notice that angles are equal since they are alternate interior angles.
Similarly we will measure C, B, D and E, D, A .
The angles are equal. This implies that line f is parallel to segment BC.
Using the Distance or Length tool, click on the points D, E and B, C.
Hence the mid-point theorem is proved.
Once again I will show the Construction Protocol for the theorem.
Click on View menu select Construction Protocol check box.
Construction Protocol' view opens next to Graphics view.
Now click on the Play button.
As an assignment, prove this theorem.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial we stated and proved,

Welcome to this tutorial on basic Arithmetic Operators.
I'll first go through plus, minus, multiply and divide operations.
These are written as plus (+), minus (-), multiply as an asterisk (*) and divide as a forward slash (/).
So, I will have 2 variables.
I'll create a variable called "$num1" and I'll save that as value equal to 10 and "$num2" is equal to 2.
So, these are both integer numbers with no decimal point.
Okay, now, say I want to add "num1" and "num2" together.
So I echo out the answer of "$num1" added to "$num2".
Let's test it out.
So, that's "12".  10 and 2, 'num1' and 'num2'; when 10 and 2 are added, the answer is "12".
Okay. Now let's try minus. We will just replace the minus symbol there.
Refresh and that will be "8".
Now let's try multiplication. 10 times 2 is 20 and we've got "20".
Next, 10 divided by 2 is just half of 10 which is "5".
Now, what we can do is we can add something on the end of this.
So, let's say this is divided by 'num2'.
So, what I think this operation will do is, it will add "num1" and "num2", so that is 10 and 2 which will give us 12 and then 12 divided by 2.
So, 12 divided by 2 should give 6.
But actually what this does is, it takes 'num2' and divides it by 'num2' which will give 1 and add 'num1' to that.
So, that means, instead of 6 we will get 11.
Now, the reason for this is that division operator will always work before addition operator.  The same with multiply.
Now, to solve this, we should put brackets.
The brackets will say - we'll take this operation first, do whatever is in here and then continue to divide by whatever this could be an integer or a variable.
So, here what it will do is 'num1' plus 'num2' which is 10 plus 2 which gives us 12 divided by 2 which should give us 6.
Let's refresh that and we can see that it worked!
So, these are the basic arithmetic operators which are simple to use.
If you come across any problems, always  verify your calculations with a calculator to make sure they're working.
We'll see a few more of these soon.
We'll learn about the increment arithmetic operator which increments by 1 but I'll use that a little later.
Just practice these and make sure you learn them well.

The syntax of the chown command is: chown space options space ownername space filename or directoryname.
Now, we will look at some examples.
Syntax of the chmod command is:  chmod space [options] space mode space filename
Alternatively, we may specify permissions by a three-digit octal-number.
The first digit stands for owner permission, the second stands for group permission and the third stands for other permission.
Now, type: ls space -l space example1
Here we can see that above command has assigned the read/write/execute permission by owner, read/execute permission by group and execute-only permission by others to file example1.
To change the permission recursively and assign the read and execute access for everyone and also write access for the owner of the directory 'directory1', type the command:
To give the user execute permission on file 'example2',  type the command:
The syntax for the chgrp command is: chgrp space [options] space newgroup space files.

Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on Recursive function.
In this tutorial, we will learn
'what is a Recursive' function
with the help of some examples.
and  GNU BASH version 4.2
Let us see what a recursive function is.
A recursive function is one which calls itself.
Recursion is a useful technique for simplifying complex algorithms.
Let me open a file named factorial.sh.
I have typed the code in this file.
factorial() is the function name.
Inside this, we print a message “Inside factorial function”.
This statement reads user's input and stores the value in variable 'n'.
Here, we have 'if-else' condition.
If condition checks whether the value of 'n' is equal to zero.
If True, it will display the message "factorial value of n is 1".
Here is the 'else' part of the 'if' statement.
It calls the 'factorial' function.
And 'fi' is the end of the 'if-else' statement.
Let us run the file "factorial.sh".
Open the terminal using CTRL+ALT and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Type: chmod space plus x space factorial dot sh
Type: dot slash factorial.sh
We see "Enter the number:" .
I will enter 0.
"factorial value of 0 is 1".
Now press the up-arrow key. Recall the previous command.
This time, I will enter 5.
"Inside factorial function".
Let us add some more logic to the 'factorial' function.
We will calculate the factorial of a number.
Come back to our code.
Now, let us replace the echo statement "Inside the factorial function" with the code block.
temp is a variable and stores the value entered by user.
'If' condition checks whether the variable value is equal to 1.
If True, it will print 1.
This is the else part of the if statement.
This reduces one from the temp variable value
and stores the result in a variable 'f'.
Variable 'f' stores the output of 'factorial' function.
This is a recursive call.
Value of variable 'f' and temp are multiplied and stored in 'f'.
Then we print the value of 'f'.
End of if-else statement and function.
Now, come back to our slides.
Let us understand the flow of the program.
The value of 'n' is taken from the user i.e. 'n'.
If the value entered is equal to zero then it prints a message
Else it goes to the function factorial.
Here, if the value is 'equal to one' then it prints value as 'one'.
If not, it makes a recursive call until the value is equal to one.
Then, all the values are multiplied and displayed.
Recall the previous command ./factorial.sh
Now I will enter 5 as the input value.
We get the factorial of number 5
that is 120.
We can see the flow of the program on terminal. Analyze and trace the flow of the program.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learned
Recursive function
with the help of some examples.
As an assignment,write a program where the recursive function calculates the sum of 'N' numbers.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on More on Forms in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
To practise this tutorial, you should have knowledge of HTML.
If not, then go through the corresponding tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML5
gedit Text Editor
However you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Open the file MyWebForm.html which we created earlier in this series, in a text editor.
We learnt about some of the input types earlier.
Now let us learn some other form input types.
Let me add a field for Date of Birth in the registration form.
Next to the Last name, type the code as shown.
Here I have used the input type date.
Save the file.
Open the file MyWebForm.html in a web browser.
Here we see a field to select date, month and year.
We can either type the values manually.
We have used the input type date in this example.
Likewise, we have some other input types to get Date Time from the user.
These are the date and time input types available in HTML.
Explore these on your own.
Now let me add the code to get the input for Gender.
Next to the Date of birth input, type the code as shown.
I have set the input type as radio.
Here I have written a single label and three input fields with the same name gender.
The user will select any one option from these three.
But each section will have a different value.
Based on the selection, the respective value will be stored.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice that the Gender field is displayed and it has three radio buttons.
Let me click on the Male radio button.
Now click on the Female radio button.
Immediately the Male radio button is unselected.
Suppose we have one more set of radio buttons.
Let us check.
Add one more field called Residential Status.
Next to the Gender field, type the code as shown.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
We got one more set of radio buttons for Residential Status.
Let me click on the Male radio button in the Gender field.
Then click on Indian in the Residential Status field.
Notice that when we click on the radio button Indian, the Male radio button remains selected.
As the radio button name is different, the selection is unchanged in the Gender field.
Next we’ll add the code to get a phone number from the user.
Here I have set the input type as number.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
We got a field for contact number
Let me type a phone number in this field.
Using the controls we can increase or decrease the numbers.
This is how the number input type works.
Instead of number input type, we can also use tel to get phone number.
Next let us try another form element called select.
Next to the contact number input type, type the code as shown.
Here I have written a code to select City from a list.
For this I’m using select tag.
Using the option tag we can add values to the list.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
We got the City field along with a drop-down list.
We can select only one value from this list.
By default, the first value is pre-selected.
There’s another way of showing this option.
Let me demonstrate that.
Before the select start tag, type the code as shown.
Then after the select end tag, type the code as shown.
I have used the tag datalist before the select element.
This will store the select option value in the form of a list.
Next to the datalist end tag, type the code as shown.
And included the datalist inside the input field.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
The drop-down is changed as a text field for City.
Let me type c h.
Immediately the values which start from c h will be displayed.
This feature is similar to Google search.
This is the speciality of datalist element in HTML5.
Now say, you want to group some of the form elements together.
And you want to do this such that it doesn’t affect the other elements.
Switch to the text editor .
Let us create a fieldset for mail id and password fields.
Before the Email label field, type the code as shown.
Along with the fieldset, I have used the legend tag to give a name for the field.
Next, to the retype password field, close the fieldset.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Till now, we have created a form to get some data from the user.
Once we have filled the form, we will click the Submit button to proceed further.
Now we will see how can we send this data to the next step.
Form method will be used when we are working with:
Each form will send the data to the next step for processing based on two methods.
This has to be defined inside the form start tag.
GET method will pass the values via URL
Passed values will be seen in the URL
Whereas,  POST method will pass the values via HTTP request.
Passed values will not be seen in the URL.
It is advisable to use POST method for secure transactions like login and money transactions.
This is the syntax.
Here the action attribute defines the place to which the values have to be passed.
With this we have come to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about:  Form Input types: Date, Radio, Number
Form Elements: Select, Datalist, Fieldset
Form Methods: GET, POST

Hello everybody. Welcome to this tutorial on Introduction to KTurtle.
In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the basics of getting started with KTurtle.
KTurtle Window
Editor,Canvas
Menu Bar,Toolbar.
Moving the Turtle
Drawing lines and changing directions
Draw a triangle.
To record this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux OS version 12.04.KTurtle version 0.8.1 beta.
What is KTurtle?
KTurtle is a free tool to learn basic programming.
It is useful for computer aided interactive learning.
KTurtle is  available for download at:
'KTurtle'- * makes programming easy and accessible.
Helps teach kids basics of mathematics.
Translates commands to speaking language of the programmer.
Translates commands into visuals.
We can install  KTurtle using Synaptic Package Manager .
please refer to Ubuntu Linux tutorials on our website:
Let's open a new 'KTurtle' Application.
Click on Dash home.
In the Search bar, type: "KTurtle"
and click on the KTurtle icon.
A typical KTurtle window looks like this.
In the menu-bar, on the top,
you will find menu items-
File, Edit, Canvas, Run, Tools, Settings and Help options.
In the toolbar, you can reach for most of the actions used.
Editor is on the left where you can type the TurtleScript commands.
Most of the functions of the editor can be found in the  File and Edit menus.
There are several ways to enter the code in the editor.
Easiest way is to use an example.
Go to  File menu > select  Examples.
Here, I will select a flower.
Code of the selected example opens in the editor.
Click on the Run button, from Menu bar or  Tool bar, to run the code.
Another way is to directly type your own code in the editor
or copy/paste some code in the editor.
For example, from other KTurtle files.
Canvas is on the right where Turtle makes your drawings.
Turtle draws according to the commands it gets from the editor on the canvas.
Run option on the toolbar starts  execution of the commands in the editor.
It presents a list of execution speeds.
Full speed (No highlighting and inspector),
Slow,Slower
Slowest and ,Step-by-Step.
Abort and  Pause options allow you to stop and pause the executions respectively.
Let's now Run this code.
Turtle draws a flower on the canvas.
When you open a new KTurtle application,
Turtle is in the middle of the canvas by default.
Let's now move the Turtle.
Turtle can do three types of moves:
It can move forward, it can move backwards.
It can turn left or right.
It can also jump directly to a position on the screen.
Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred.
Let us go through a simple example.
In your editor, type the following commands:
"reset"
"forward 100"
"turnright 120"
"forward 100"
"turnright 120"
"forward 100"
"turnright 120"
Note that the color of the code changes as we type.
This feature is called highlighting.
Different types of commands are highlighted differently
which makes it easier to read large blocks of code.
I will explain the code now.
reset command sets Turtle to  default position.
forward 100 commands Turtle to move forward by 100 pixels.
turnright 120  commands Turtle to turn 120 degrees anti-clockwise.
Note that these two commands are repeated thrice to draw a triangle.
Let's now execute the code.
I will choose  Slow step so that we understand what commands are being executed.
Here the triangle is drawn.
Let's look at another example and also learn how to beautify our canvas.
Let's draw a triangle using repeat command.
I will clear the current program.
Let me zoom into the program text to have a clear view.
Type the following commands into your editor:
reset
canvassize space 200, 200
canvascolor space 0, 255, 0
pencolor space 0, 0, 255
penwidth space 2
repeat space 3  within curly braces {
forward 100
turnleft 120
Let me now explain the code.
canvassize 200, 200 sets the canvas width and height to 200 pixels.
canvascolor 0, 255, 0  makes the canvas green.
0, 255 ,0 is a RGB combination  where only the green value is set to 255 and  the others are set to 0.
This makes the canvas  green in color.
pencolor 0, 0, 255 sets the color of the pen to blue.
RGB combination where blue value is set to 255.
penwidth 2 sets the width of the pen to 2  pixels.
repeat command is followed by a number  and a list of commands within curly brackets.
This repeats the commands within the curly brackets, the specified number of times.
Here, the commands forward 100 and turnleft 120 are within curly brackets.
repeat command is followed by the number 3 because a triangle has 3 sides.
These commands are run 3 times in a loop.
3 sides of the triangle are drawn.
Let's run the code now.
I will select Slow  option for execution of the program.
The canvas color becomes green and  the Turtle draws a triangle.
Let's now save the file.
Select File menu > Save As .
Save As dialog-box opens.
I will select Document folder for saving the file.
I will type the file name as "triangle" and click on Save button.
Notice that the name of the file appears in the top panel and it is saved as a dot turtle file, like all Turtle files.
KTurtle's editor, canvas, menubar and toolbar
Move Turtle
Draw lines and change directions
Draw a triangle.
As an assignment, I would like you to * draw a square using the  commands-
forward, backward, turnleft, turnright and repeat.
Set background color, penwidth and pencolor of your choice.
Change values in the  RGB combination.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Select with Aggregate functions.
In this tutorial, we will learn more clauses that can be used with the select statement, such as-
Between,
In,
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of database and tables.
For more details, refer to the RDBMS – PostgreSQL series on this website.
Let’s begin. First we will learn about the DISTINCT clause.
DISTINCT keyword is used in the SELECT statement to list distinct and unique values.
The syntax is as follows:
Let us open the pgAdmin for the demonstration.
Click on the SQL icon to open the SQL Editor.
It will eliminate duplicate values from the specified column i.e. city.
Let us execute the query to see the output.
Next, we will learn about the BETWEEN operator.
BETWEEN operator is used to retrieve values within a given range.
The syntax is: SELECT column-names FROM table-name WHERE column-name BETWEEN value1 and value2;
Let's see an example for between operator.
Let's clear the screen and type the code for the query.
Say, I want to retrieve details of students who are born between January 1995 and January 1996.
Let's see the output.
We will see another example for BETWEEN operator.
This query will show all rows from the students table where the cgpa value is between 7.8 and 8.5.
Notice from the output that the value is inclusive of 7.8 and 8.5.
The same query can also be written as shown here.
Instead of BETWEEN operator, we can use-  greater than or equal to and
Execute the query to see the output.
Next we will learn about the LIKE operator.
LIKE operator is used to match text values against a given pattern.
It allows wildcard characters to be used within the WHERE clause.
There are two wildcards that can be used in conjunction with the LIKE operator-
Percent (%):
Underscore (_):
We will see few examples using percent wildcard.
Suppose I don't remember the exact name of a student.
It is very difficult to search the entire students table as there are many rows in the table.
To make the search easy, we can use the LIKE operator as shown here.
Here, all the student's names start with 'Ra' and is followed by any sequence of characters.
Let us see a few more examples.
This query returns those rows where the students’ names end with 'la'.
There can be any number of characters before 'la'.
Let us see another pattern.
Note percent sign before and after 'am'.
Next we will see how to use underscore to match a single character.
This will fetch rows of students whose name has three characters and has 'a' in the 2
Underscore 'r' percent matches students whose names begin with a single character.
Next we will see how to use IN operator.
Use IN operator in the WHERE clause to check if the value matches any value in a given list.
Let us see an example.
This statement will return all rows from the students table   where the city is either Chennai, Nagpur or Hyderabad.
It helps to reduce the usage of multiple OR conditions to get the same result.
Next we will see how to use the IS NULL operator in the select statement.
This statement will list down the records where the date of birth column is empty.
In the same way, we can also use the IS NOT NULL operator as shown here.
Let us now learn about aggregate function.
Aggregate functions are PostgreSQL built-in functions.
It operates on several rows of a query and returns a single result.
List of aggregate functions -
Count – It returns the number of rows in a table.
Sum – Returns the sum of a selected column.
Max - Returns the largest value of a specified column.
Min – Returns the smallest value of a specified column.
Avg – Returns the average value for a specified column.
Switch back to SQL Editor window.
Let’s say, we want to count the number of existing records in the students table.
The count open parentheses asterisk close parentheses function returns the number of rows that are fetched by the SELECT statement.
Execute this query to see the output.
There are 14 records in the students table.
We can also specify the column name in the function as shown here.
Once again execute the query.
Why is it showing 13?
Let us see the output when we specify the date of birth column.
Type the code and execute.
Here, we can see the date of birth column value is NULL for the student 'Ram charan'.
I have left date of birth column blank during record creation for this student.
Next, let us see how to use the SUM function.
Let us clear the screen.
Type the code as shown here and execute the query.
You can also give an additional 'Where' condition as shown here.
This returns the sum of cgpa values of the students who are from Mumbai city.
Next, let us find the maximum cgpa score.
This select statement returns the maximum cgpa score from the students table.
Likewise, you can try the remaining aggregate functions on your own.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about More clauses that can be used with the select statement, such as-
As an assignment, write select statements to display all columns from students table where the student name ends with 'a'.
Display the minimum and average of the cgpa column.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet the GIMP.
In the previous tutorial I left you with this image.
I want to make the ship a bit darker in this image.
And the best way to do this is to work with Layers.
So, first I zoom into the image where the ship is.
And I click on the option of adding a New Layer and simply add a new layer.
I name this layer as 'ship' and I choose the Layer Fill Type as Transparency.
Now the next step is to reduce the luminosity of all the three colour channels and to do that I have to use the Multiply mode & this time
I use gray colour to be multiplied with the other colours here because it helps in getting the ship darker in the image.
So, go to the option of colour selection mode and reduce the value of gray colour by pulling the slider down until I get a nice gray colour shade.
And now, just pull the gray colour into the image and you get a darker image with a dark ship.
Coming back to the Layers dialog, I can control the intensity of gray colour with the help of opacity slider and by turning the gray layer on and off.
But the effect of the layer is applied to the whole image and I want the effect to be restricted to the area of the ship.
For doing that, I use a layer mask.
A layer mask defines where the layer should be visible and where it should be invisible.
I go to the layer named ship and I right click on that layer. And then select the option Add Layer Mask and I select Black in Initialize Layer Mask because black helps in hiding all the layers & white helps to showing all the layers.
And these other options I will explain in future tutorials. Click on Add.
You can see the layer has no effect.
I can switch the layer on & off, but no effect after adding layer mask.
But I can paint into the layer mask or use some other edit tools.
And when I paint or use the tools , the effect will be revealed into the image.
To paint into the layer, I use white foreground colour & black background colour.
I click on the Brush tool, go to the option dialog, and select a  brush which is 19 pixels in Circle.
And I again go to the Layers dialog to check if the layer mask is selected because I have to paint the layer mask and not the layer.
Let me show you the effect.
I change the layer mode to Normal layer mode & as you see the fore layer in the image is invisible.
I select a brush here and start painting on the portion of the ship and you can see a gray layer is revealed.
Now when I select the layer itself & paint, you can see the layer is now painted in white colour and not gray.
I select the layer mask again and press the ‘x’ key to change the foreground colour to black and background colour to white.
And start painting with white colour into my layer mask.
And because of  black colour the image is hidden.
I can undo the unwanted effects simply by pressing ctrl + z and here we are back to paint the layer mask of the ship.
Now I change the background colour to black and foreground colour to white and start filling the form of the ship.
I think it’s much easier to paint in Normal mode.
As we get a gray ship after painting in Normal mode, it is easier to differentiate from  background than in Multiply layer mode.
To paint into the fine edges of the ship, I reduce the brush size.
You can select a small brush in 3 different methods.
First is by using the scale to reduce the size of the brush,
2nd way is to click the small blue triangle here and select the brush of any size or else you can do that by typing the square brackets.
'Open square bracket' reduces the brush size and 'close square bracket' increases the size of the brush.
I want to use the small brush for the details, so I press 'open square bracket'.
But you can imagine what I have to do here and you don’t have to look over my shoulder for painting the whole ship.
Now I have finished painting the whole ship with a gray layer.
And I will have to check for the areas where I have overpainted the edge.
So, I switch the layer mode to Multiply mode and reduce the opacity slider a bit.
Adjust the opacity slider in such a way that you get a dark ship in the image.
And I have done a fairly good job.
But I am not so happy with the surface of the river in front of the ship.
And I have to make it a bit brighter.
So, I change the foreground colour to black by pressing the x key and start painting into the surface of the river in front of the ship with black colour to make it less darker than the ship.
I have to check out this effect once I finish working on the image and do the changes accordingly.
Now let’s check out the work I have done.
I zoom into the image using the  zoom mode and I can make the ship a bit darker and brighter just by sliding the opacity slider.
I think this looks good and I have done a good job by masking the layer.
But I think the colour of the ship is a bit dull and this is possible because the 'ship' layer is above the 'colour correction layer' and they are working before the ship layer; so I just drop the 'ship' layer down, below the 'colour correction layers'.
And you can see the change, the colour of the ship gets neutral now.
Now I look at the whole image and the shortcut key is Shift+ Ctrl +E.
And I think it is a fairly good balance between the background colour, the birds and the ship. Perhaps I should slide down a bit with the intensity of the ship.
And now it looks better.
I think this is best.
When I compare the image without darkening and  the ship layer, the birds and the ship are fairly dark in the ship layer and I think I got a good result by using layer mask for this image.
I can change the effects with the help of all the layer tools at anytime.
I nearly forgot a thing that I painted the layer mask with very sharp edge & when I zoom into the image, you can see there is a hard border here and I want a little bit smoother.
Because this may look a bit artificial, specially in a foggy seen.
For that, I select the layer mask to edit it a bit and choose Filter from the tool bar and select Blur.
In Blur I choose Gaussian Blur and go into the part of the ship and I drop down the value of Horizontal Radius to 4 and click on OK and blur the layer mask and you can see the effect that the hard edge of the ship is gone and now it looks good.
Now I m ready to do some corrective work with the image.
When you look at the image, you can see here a bit of wood in the water and on the left side is half a bird which is cut off at the edge and I want to clone them out.
So, again I choose the Zoom tool, and zoom in where the part of wood is and now choose the Healing tool.
Healing tool is bit like the Clone tool but it works better in this case here.
When I select the healing tool, I get a circle with the mouse point but I can’t click into the image & there is a forbidden sign in the mouse point.
The forbidden sign is because I haven’t selected the heal source and I can do it with the control (Ctrl) and click.
I have to select a good heal source and then I have to press Ctrl and click and I think this is a good place as heal source and now click on the wood part.
There is a problem here.
And the problem here is that I am working on the wrong layer.
I have to work on the background layer and I was trying to do the edit on the layer mask.
Of course, I have to choose a background layer and make a copy of that layer because I don’t want to alter the original background layer.
Now let's try Healing tool again.
And now I have made another mistake.
My source was this gray layer above.
And of course, I undo this and select a new source here. Alright, take that here and just click here and it is gone.
For this part, I select this part as the source and click and you can see it’s gone.
Let’s look at the image in 100% mode.
It looks quite good, perhaps I should have done it with a little bit greater brush because these dots are still together.
So again I select the Healing tool and select the source and clicked on the dots.
I think that worked.
Now I have to disappear this half cut bird on the left side.
For this, I zoom again into the image here and  I select the Clone tool.
Cloning tool is not so complex like healing tools and I really don’t have a big experience in using this tool as it is new in the GIMP.
So, I have to follow same procedure like Healing tool. I just click here as a source, click on the bird here and I think this works.
Back to 100%. Perfect, this bird is gone.
I think this image is ready now.
First I wanted to make this image a bit brighter but I think I do it as finishing steps and I think it works the way it is now.
And I want to give this image to print to get a poster from it.
And the printer uses an aspect ratio of 3:2 and this image has the aspect ratio 2:1. So now, I have to change that.
I can do this with the help of canvas size which is there in Image in the tool bar.
I select Canvas Size and see that the image is 1868 pixels wide and the height is 945 and for calculating the ratio I use my calculator.
So, I divide 1868 by 3 and then multiply with 2 which gives me 1245.
I have to unchain this here, otherwise the width will change too and type into the Height 1245.
Now the image is OK.
It will fit on top and leave a white strip on the bottom and I don’t resize the layers, just click on OK and now I have an image with little bit of nothing on the bottom.
I have to fill the bottom part and for that, I choose a New Layer with Layer Fill Type White and use this layer as the bottom most layer.
This white area in the bottom will be cut off later.
But I can use it as the clue for the printer.
The printer is simply a computer with a print engine behind it and test to get some clues how to handle.
This image is quite unusual here, it is nearly black and white and it has not much contrast in it.
I select a rectangle here just over the whole image, select the Blend tool, the gradient filled with, set the Gradient to 'black to white'.
And now I fill this here up with the gradient.
Just click and draw a line and now I have the full colour range from black and white in the rectangle.
I have an area here from black to full white.
I repeat this one more time.
Choosing the Blend tool here and this time I use a special gradient called Full saturation; it has all the colour range in it.
And again fill this  gradient, now I have hints for the printer how to preserve the image and if the colours are off I can always say here, this was suppose to be red and this was suppose to be green.
I think this was it for today.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Linux File System.
I am using Linux Operating system.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website
Also note that linux is case sensitive.
In Linux, almost everything is a file.
So, what is a file? In real life, we know that a file is where we store our documents and papers.
Similarly, in Linux a file is a container for storing information.
A directory helps us in organizing our files in a systematic manner.
It allows different users to have their own directories with their files which others cannot access or modify.
Also, if there are no directories, all the files on the system need to have unique names which would be very difficult to maintain.
These definitions of files and directories are good to get a general feel about them; they are not entirely accurate.
As well as its contents, a file has a name and some properties or “administrative information” that is, the file’s creation/modification date and its permissions.
Thus,  properties are stored in the file’s inode- a special block of data in the file system that also contains the length of the file and where on the disk it’s stored.
The system uses the number of the file’s inode ; the directory structure just names the file for our benefit as it's easier for us to remember names than larger numbers.
Contrary to its oversimplified definition, a directory does not actually store other files, it itself is a file that holds the inode numbers and names of other files.
In fact, in Linux there are three kinds of files:
Regular Files or Ordinary files: It contains only data, as a stream of characters.
Directories: As we just saw in the previous slides.
Device Files: All hardware devices and peripherals are represented as files in Linux.
A CD, a Hard disk or even an usb stick, everything is a file in Linux. But why is this so? This helps to read and write these devices in a way similar to that for ordinary files.
All files in Linux are related. In short, all form a family much like we do.
A directory containing say- some files and sub-directories, will have a parent – child relationship with each other. This gives rise to the Linux File System Tree.
At the top is the root( denoted by a frontslash /). It contains all the other files and directories.
This also helps in easy navigation from one file or directory to other, if we know the correct path.
As we work with a Linux file system, it seems that we are moving along this tree.
One command and there you are... teleported from one place to other.
Sounds interesting!! Indeed it is, as we will see.
When we login into the Linux system, we are by default in a home directory.
To see the home directory , type at the command prompt: echo space dollar H-O-M-E in capital and press Enter.
This gives the path name of our home directory.
We can move around from one directory to other.
But, any time we can be in one directory and this directory is known as the current directory or working directory.
The pwd command helps us to see the current directory. pwd stands for present working directory.
Type at the command prompt pwd and press Enter. Now, this is our present working directory.
We have said that we can move from one directory to other.
But how do we do so? We have the cd command for this purpose.
You have to type the command cd followed by the path name of the directory you want to move to.
Let's again see our current directory by typing pwd at the command prompt and press Enter.
So, now we are placed in this directory.
Now, say we want to move to slash usr directory. So, type: cd space slash usr. Remember, here slash in linux means front-slash and press Enter.
Now lets see our current directory. Type pwd and press Enter.
Yes, we have moved to slash usr directory.
The problem here is, the path names can be very long; this is because these are Absolute Path names that enlist the entire path, starting from the root directory.
Instead, we may use Relative path names that begin from the current directory.
Here, we need to know two special characters. dot that represent the current directory and dot dot that represent the parent directory of the current directory.
Now, let us have a brief session on cd command.
The command cd, without any argument, is used to move back to the home directory.
Type at the command prompt cd and press Enter.
Now check our current directory by the pwd command.
So, now we are back in our home directory- /home/gnuhata [slash home slash gnuhata].
Now, let us move to music directory. Type at the command prompt cd space Music (M in capital) slash and press Enter.
Now check our current directory by the pwd command. pwd and press enter. See, we have moved  /home/gnuhata/Music.
Let us go to the parent directory of Music. For that, you have to use cd command with dot dot.
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot dot and press Enter.
Now check our present directory by typing pwd. We are again in /home/gnuhata.
Now, let's try to move to a sub-directory of the current directory using dot.
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot slash Documents (D in capital) slash. Press Enter.
Check our current directory by typing pwd. We are at-  /home/gnuhata/Documents.
Let me clear the screen by pressing control L. So you can see clearly.
To go back to our home directory by cd command, type cd and press Enter.
Again check our current directory by pwd command. We are back to /home/gnuhata.
We can combine any number of dot dot separated by slash in a relative path.
In this slide, we can see the file system hierarchy. Root or slash is at the top. home and bin are two sub-directories under root. username , here the directory named gnuhata, is a sub-directory under home.
So, now we are in /home/gnuhata. Now, how can we go to the bin directory?
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot dot slash dot dot slash bin and press Enter.
Check our current directory by the command pwd.  We are at /bin (slash bin).
The first ".." (dot dot) takes us from /home/gnuhata (slash home slash gnuhata) to /home (slash home).
The next, takes us from slash home to root.
Now from root or slash, we have moved to /bin directory.
Go back to our home directory by the command cd.
To create a directory, we use the mkdir command.
You have to type the command and the name of directory to be created and a directory would be created under the current directory.
To create a directory named testdir, type the command: mkdir space testdir and press Enter.
This creates the testdir directory successfully.
Note that, there is no explicit notification of successful directory creation or removal.
If you do not get any error message, it denotes successful execution.
We can also use the relative or absolute path name to create a directory anywhere in the tree provided we have the permission to do so and a directory by that name does not already exist.
This process can be used for making multiple directories or even a hierarchy of directories.
Type: mkdir space test1 space test2 and press Enter. This will make two directories named test1 and test2 under the present directory.
Type: "'mkdir space testtree space testtree slash test3'".
This will make a directory testtree and another directory test3 which is a sub-directory under testtree.
So, we have created four directories namely testdir, test1, test2 and testtree in the current directory, out of which first three are empty and the last one contains a sub-directory namely test3.
Similar to the mkdir command is the rmdir command which is used for removing a directory or directories.
The command rmdir space test1 removes the test1 directory successfully.
A directory can be removed only if you are its owner, your current directory is hierarchically above the directory to be removed and the directory is empty.
Now type at the command prompt: '"cd space testtree slash test3"'.
So, we are now in test3 directory which is a sub-directory under testtree.
Let's try to remove the testdir directory by typing the command rmdir space testdir. Press Enter.
We see it can't be done because the current directory is not hierarchically above the directory to be removed.
So, we have to go to the directory which is hierarchically above testdir directory.
Type: "'cd space dot dot"' and press Enter.
Now, go back to our parent directory by typing the command "'cd space dot dot'".
Now, again try the previous command.
Type: "rmdir space testdir". Press Enter.
The testdir directory is successfully deleted. Note that, testdir directory was also empty.
Multiple directories or a hierarchy of directories can be removed at once. So, try to delete the testtree directory along with its sub-directory test3.
Type at the command prompt: rmdir space testtree space testtree slash test3 press Enter.
See, it is giving the error message that 'testree' directory cannot be removed because 'testtree' is not empty.
But one thing which you may miss is that testtree slash test3 has been deleted as it was empty.
To check that, type at the command prompt: cd space testtree and press Enter.
Now, type ls and press Enter. See, the directory contains nothing. So, 'test3' was deleted.
So, in this linux tutorial we have learnt about Linux Files and directories and how to work with Linux Directories. See them, move between them, make them, remove them.

To record this tutorial, I am using: DWSIM 5.2 (Classic UI) and  Windows 10.
The process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS also such as-
To practice this tutorial, you should know:
to  add components to a flowsheet,
add material streams and specify their properties.
We will develop a flowsheet to determine Outlet stream properties after absorption.
Here we give compounds, inlet stream conditions and property package.

Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial onAdvance topics in a function .
source command To put a function in the background
with the help of some examples.
source command is used to load a file into Shell script.
It reads and executes commands from that file.
It also imports code into the script.
This is useful when multiple scripts use a common data or a function library.
The syntax for source command is as follows-
source filename
source Path_to_file
souce filename arguments.
Let me open a file  'function dot sh'.
This is theshebang line.
source detail dot sh will load the file detail dot sh into function dot sh.
Let me open detail dot sh file.
I have a function machine.
Now, type inside the function-
echo "function machine is called in function dot sh file" .
Now let us go back to function dot sh file.
Here, type: echo “Beginning of program”.
Then type:  machine echo “End of program”.
This will print the message “Beginning of program”.
machine is the function call.
And this will print the message End of program.
Note that machine is the function which we created in the detail dot sh file.
And we are calling the function, here, in function dot sh file.
Now click on Save.
So, type on the terminal: chmod space  plus (+) x space function dot sh
Type: dot slash function dot sh
Now let's move on to background function.
To run a process in the background, we use & (ampersand) at the end of a function call.
The shell forks a child process to run the command.
The forked process will have a job number and a PID (Process Identifier).
Let us understand this with the help of an example. I will open the file background dot sh.
bg underscore function marks the beginning of the function.
The echo statement here displays the message "Inside bg_function”.
Next, we will use the find command to find all the dotmp3 files.
This statement will find all the files with the extension dot mp3.
It will do so in the current working directory.
Hyphen iname is used to ignore the case.
And the result is stored in myplaylist.txt.
Now, type: bg underscore function ampersand(&). This is the function call. '&'(Ampersand) puts 'bg_function' in the background.
Now click on Save.
Type: chmod space plus x space background dot sh
Press Enter.Now, type: dot slash background dot sh
Blank output indicates dot mp3 file is not present in current directory.
Now, come back to our program.
Type: echo (hyphen) -e "Process running in background are: backslash n"  and jobs space hyphen l
This echo statement will display the message “Process running in background are ”.
jobs space hyphen l lists the status of all background jobs.
Now, type:  dot slash background.sh.
The output is shown.
Here, one within opening and closing square bracket is the job number.
3962 is the PID.
PID will vary accordingly.
If the function takes time to execute, it will run the process in the background
and we will see the status as "Running".
If the function gets executed before the script, we will see the status as "Done".
The output will vary from machine to machine.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learned:

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Annotations.
In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to specify an annotation and  how to define a record.
To record this tutorial, I am using:OpenModelica 1.9.2.
To understand and practice this tutorial, you need knowledge of class definition in Modelica.
Please watch the prerequisite tutorials available on our website.
Annotations can appear at multiple locations in a class.
They may be used to:  change simulation settings ,  to add supporting documentation and  to add icon and diagram views to a class.
In the previous tutorials, we used SimulationSetup button in the toolbar, to vary simulation settings.
experiment is a model annotation that may be used to vary the following:  Start Time , Stop Time ,Tolerance and Interval.
Discussion of Tolerance and Interval are beyond the scope of this tutorial series.
Shown here is an example, demonstrating the syntax of experiment annotation.
Now, we shall understand experiment annotation through a class named bouncingBallWithAnnotations.
Let me switch to OMEdit.
Please download all the files available on our website.
Let me open the necessary model files for this tutorial.
Press Ctrl+O.
Go to the appropriate location on your Desktop and select color.mo and bouncingBallWithAnnotations.
These files are now open in OMEdit.
We will first look into bouncingBallWithAnnotations.
This model is an extension of the bouncingBall model which we discussed in previous tutorials.
Please watch the prerequisite tutorials for more information on this model.
Double-click on bouncingBallWithAnnotations in Libraries Browser.
Let me shift OMEdit window to the left, for better visibility.
Switch to text view if the class opens in either Icon/Diagram View.
The model is now open in Text View.
Let me scroll-down a little bit.
Here, we use the experiment annotation to set startTime to 0 and stopTime to 5 units.
experiment annotation serves the same purpose as Simulation Setup toolbox.
Click on Simulation Setup button in the toolbar.
You can see the same stopTime and startTime fields here.
We changed the values of these fields using experiment annotation.
Let us simulate the model now.
Click on Simulate button.
Select h in variables browser.
Note that the simulation interval is 5 units.
This is due to startTime and ‘StopTime fields of experiment annotation.
Now de-select h and delete the result.
Click on Modeling button at bottom right.
Now, let us learn more about adding documentation to a model using annotations.
The highlighted text appears in Documentation annotation.
Now, let me show an application of Documentation annotation.
Go to the top left of modeling area.
Click on fourth button which is Documentation View.
You can view the text typed in Documentation annotation in the browser.
This functionality allows us to add useful information for larger models which require documentation.
Close Documentation Browser. Let me go back to the slides.
Record is a specialized class used to define a record data structure.
For example, bank accounts have records with person’s name, age etc.. as fields.
Records can only contain variables. They may not contain equations.
Shown here is an example record named Person.
It has name and age as its fields.
Let me switch to OMEdit to demonstrate record definition.
Let me shift OMEdit window to the right.
We will now use the file named Color.
To open it in Textview, double-click on color icon in Libraries Browser.
This record has three variables named red, blue and green.
You may see that Simulate button doesn’t appear in the toolbar.
This indicates that records are not meant to be simulated.
Now let me go back to slides.
It is easier to understand annotation elements as records.
For example, experiment annotation can be considered as a record with StartTime, StopTime, Interval and Tolerance as its fields.
Graphical elements can be interpreted similarly.
We will understand more about the interpretation of annotations as records when we discuss icon and diagram views.
Vary the stop time for simulation of bouncingBallWithAnnotations class from 10 to 20 units.
Use experiment annotation for this purpose.
Simulate the class after this change.
Plot h vs time and notice the change in simulation stop time.
It summarises spoken tutorial project.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc- Inserting Charts in spreadsheets.
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:
Creating, Editing and Formatting Charts
Resizing and moving of Charts.
So, let us start learning about the various viewing options in LibreOffice Calc.
Charts can be powerful ways to convey information to the reader.
LibreOffice Calc offers a variety of charts formats for your data.
Using Calc, you can customize charts to a considerable extent too.
Let us open our "personal finance tracker.ods" sheet.
And let us fill the amount spent on each of the items listed in the sheet.
We will click on the cell referenced as E3 and type the amount as 6500.
Now going down the column, we will type the amounts as 1000, 625, 310 and 2700 in the cell referenced as “E4”, ”E5”, ”E6” and “E7” respectively.
Next, we shall fill the amounts received on each of the items listed in the sheet.
So, click on the cell referenced as “F3” and type the amount as 500.
Now going down this column, we will type the amounts as 200, 75, 10 and 700 in the cells referenced as “F4”, ”F5”, ”F6” and “F7” respectively.
Let us now learn how to create a chart for this table.
In order to create a chart, we have to first select the data to be included in the chart.
So, click on the cell “SN” and without releasing the mouse button, drag the cursor till the last cell which has 700 in it.
Now, click on the Insert option in the Menu bar and then click on the Chart option.
You see that the default chart with the date is inserted into the worksheet.
Simultaneously the "Chart Wizard" dialogue box opens up.
The "Chart Wizard" shows that the default chart is selected.
This default chart updates to reflect the changes you make in the Chart Wizard.
The "Chart Wizard" dialogue-box has three main parts- the steps involved in setting up the chart, choice of chart types and the options for each chart type.
By checking the 3D Look option, one can also get the chart display in three dimension.
Let's try these options.
We will click on the Bar option under the “Choose a chart type” field.
Observe that the sample chart shows the representation of the data in the table in the “Bar” format.
Similarly, you can click on the other options like “Pie”, <pause> “Area”, <pause> “Bubble” <pause>
and many other options under the Choose a chart type field and get the required type of chart.
Under the Steps option, we have another option named “Data Range”.
Using this option, you can manually edit the range of data you want to represent in the chart.
The default option of plotting data is “Data series in columns”.
We can change the way we want to plot the data by using “Data series in rows” instead.
This is useful if you use a style of chart such as “Column” to display your data.
Lastly, you can choose whether to use the “First row as label”
or “First column as label”
or both as labels on the axes of the chart.
Then click on Data series in column again.
Now, in our sample chart, if we wish to remove the data under the heading “Received”, we can do so by first clicking inside the “Data range” field.
And then editing the range “$A$1 is to $F$7” to “$A$1 is to $D$7”.
Observe that the data under the heading “Received” is no longer represented in the chart.
Next, let's see what “Data Series” does.
Notice there are 5 rows here, representing the total rows of data in our spreadsheet.
The “Add” and “Remove” buttons will allow us to add or remove rows of data from the chart.
We can also re-order the data by using the “Up” and “Down” buttons.
So, after selecting what and how to represent data in the chart, click on the “Finish” button in the dialog-box.
You see that the chart is inserted into the spreadsheet.
After learning about how to insert charts in spreadsheet,
we will now learn how to format charts in LibreOffice Calc.
The “Format” menu has many options for formatting
and fine-tuning the appearance of the charts.
Let us format the chart we inserted into the spreadsheet.
So, double-click on the chart so that it is enclosed by a gray border
indicating that it is in the Edit mode.
Now, click on the Format option in the main menu.
You see that the drop down menu contains a number of formatting options like “Format Selection”, “Position and Size”, “Arrangement”, “Chart Wall”, “Chart Area” and many more.
They are used for positioning the chart, arranging and formatting the background and title of the chart.
We will learn about the most frequently used formatting options one by one.
The “Format Selection” option opens a dialog-box with the heading “Chart Area”.
Observe that there are 3 tabs here - “Borders”, “Area” and “Transparency”.
By default, Borders tab is selected.
Let us change the style and color of the chart’s border.
To do so, click on the “Style” field and choose “Continuous”.
Then, similarly in the “Color” field click on “Green”.
Notice that the style and color of the chart border changes accordingly.
The “Title” option formats the title of the chart and its axes.
The “Axis” option formats the lines that create the chart
as well as the font of the text that appears on both the X and Y axes.
Explore all of these options on your own later, in order to learn what they do.
Calc also provides an option for changing the background of the chart area.
The chart area is the area surrounding the chart graphic, including the main title and key.
To format the chart area, click on the “Format” option and select “Chart Wall”.
You see that a dialog-box appears with the heading “Chart Wall”.
The “Style” field displays “Continuous” as this was our last choice.
In the “Color” field, let’s click on “Red”.
We will also change the size to “0.20”cm.
You see that the style and color of the chart area changes.
Next we will learn about how to resize and move elements in a chart.
For resizing a chart, click on the sample chart.
You see that green handles appear around the chart.
To increase or decrease the size of the chart, click and drag one of the markers in one of the four corners of the chart.
In order to move the chart, first click on the chart.
Now hover the cursor anywhere over the chart.
The cursor turns to a hand.
Click and move the chart to the desired location. Now, release the mouse button.
You have moved the chart!
Next we will learn how to resize charts by using the “Position and Size” dialog box.
Again, click on the chart.
Now, right-click on the chart and select “Position and Size” from the context menu.
The “Position and Size” dialog box appears.
It has various fields that can set the 'X' and 'Y' positions of the chart as well as the width and height of the chart.
Let us set the 'X' coordinate to “1.00” “ and 'Y' coordinate to “0.83” “ for our chart.
Click on the OK button.
We see that the chart positions itself according to the set values within the chart area.
To summarize, we learned how to: Create charts, edit and format them.
We also learnt how to resize and move the charts within the spreadsheet.
Comprehensive Assignment-
Open your spreadsheet “practice.ods”
Insert a "Pie chart" for the data.
Resize and move the chart to the bottom right corner of the sheet.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Introduction to snappyHexMesh in OpenFOAM.
As a pre-requisite, the user requires:
Let us learn to create a Mesh with the snappyHexMesh utility.
The steps are as follows-
We will open the terminal and enter the path for flange as shown. Type: cd space OpenFOAM-2.2.2/tutorials/mesh/snappyHexMesh/flange and press Enter.
Now type "ls" and press Enter. There are two folders constant and system.
Type cd space system and press Enter.
Now type ls and press Enter. You can see snappyHexMeshDict file.
To view the contents of the file, type: -gedit space snappyHexMeshDict and press Enter.(Note that H, M and D here are in capital letters.)
This will open up the snappyHexMeshDict file.
snappyHexMeshDict file contains all the instructions and the entire process revolves around this file.
With the first rows of snappyHexMeshDict, you can activate or skip sections of the process.
In the geometry section, all active regions that take part in snappy process can be defined.
The parameters that govern the process of cell splitting are described in castellatedMeshControls section.
The parameters that are listed below are well explained in snappyHexMeshDict file. nCellsBetweenLevels defines the number of cells for each refinement level.
The higher it is, the more gradual the mesh will be.
In the Explicit feature edge refinement section, you can set specific refinement level for geometry’s feature edges. The ".eMesh" file can be obtained with the surfaceFeatureExtract utility.
In the surface-based refinement section, you can set the refinement levels of all surfaces defined in geometry file.
Mesh selection is a very important parameter. If the chosen point is inside the surface described in geometry file, then snappyHexMesh will create the internal mesh.
Otherwise, the external part (i.e. inside the blockMesh) is meshed.
The next step involves moving cell vertex points onto the surface geometry.
The snapping process is carried out by four parameters:
These parameters control the number of iterations and tolerance between mesh and STL surface.
nSmoothPatch option specifies the number of times the exterior (that is the boundary wall) should be iterated. The mesh will become smoother if the number of iterations are more.
Tolerance option specifies the distance the program should look for a point to snap. The distance will be the number that is in tolerance.
nSolveIter option specifies the number of times the snapping part of snappyHexMesh should be run.
nRelaxIter option specifies the number of times the mesh should run a relaxing script, that removes bad mesh points.
The process of mesh layer addition involves shrinking the existing mesh from the boundary and inserting layers of cells.
The first group of parameters define the dimensions for layers and surface, on which they will be attached.
RelativeSizes option (that is true or false) changes the way to read the parameters given next.
In layers option, you can define the number of layers and the patch on which to attach the layers. It must be an STL (Bold text)  patch in geomery sub-menu, and not a user defined region.
ExpansionRatio parameters set the growth factor of the layers (that is ratio between two subsequent layers).
finalLayerThickness parameter sets the thickness of the last layer. minThickness parameter sets the minimum allowable thickness of layer.
Advanced settings is the second group of parameters. It contains more specific controls that can help in layer creation.
FeatureAngle is the angle above which the surface will not be extruded.
nRelaxIter option specifies the number of times the mesh will run a relaxing script.
maxFaceThicknessRatio option specifies the maximum allowable value of aspect ratio.
meshQualityControls parameter sets the minimum thresholds to generate mesh in snap and add-layers parts.
In 99% of the cases, it is better to leave the default values. But sometimes, you can deactivate one or more controls to force mesh generation.
These are the different parameters in snappyHexMeshDict. These parameters are important to generate mesh using snappyHexMesh utility.
In this tutorial, we learnt different parameters in snappyHexMesh to generate mesh in OpenFoam.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Hosting Git Repositories.
In this tutorial, we will learn about:  Git repository hosting services
Creating a GitHub account
Creating a repository in GitHub and  creating a tag in the repository.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and Firefox web browser.
For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection.
You should also have basic knowledge of Git commands.
If not, for relevant Git tutorials, please visit the link shown.
First, let us learn about Git repository hosting services.
There are many web-based hosting services available such as Bitbucket, CloudForge and GitHub.
Here you can import your Git repositories free of cost.
They provide a centralized location to share your repository, so that many people can collaborate on a project easily.
They allow you to download and study others projects free of cost.
Next, we will see why to use GitHub.
GitHub has become the most popular website for housing Open Source Software.
In GitHub, you can view, discuss and review changes with your team effectively.
The procedure used in GitHub will be similar to other free Git hosting websites.
You can explore them yourself later.
Next, we will learn how to create an account in GitHub.
Open your web browser and go to www.github.com.
Here, in the homepage, you have to give your details for registration.
I will type: "priya-spoken" as user name and
"priyaspoken@gmail.com" as email-id.
Please type your preferred user name and valid email id.
Then, I will type my password.
You can give any password as per your choice.
Now, click on Sign up for GitHub button at the bottom right.
Next, in Step 2, we have to choose our plan.
I will choose Free plan as I want to use the free service.
Now, click on Finish sign up button.
Next, we will create a repository in GitHub.
You can see a button New repository  in the right side box; click on it.
It shows a message “Please verify your email address”.
GitHub will send a verification mail to our registered email id.
So, we have to open our email account and click on the email which is sent by GitHub.
I have already signed-in to my email-id which is registered with GitHub.
I have an email from GitHub.
Let me click on it.
The subject line says, “Please verify your email address”.
If the mail is not found in your Inbox, please check your Spam or Junk folders.
Now, click on Verify email address button.
We are redirected to the GitHub Homepage.
This indicates that we have successfully created our account in GitHub.
We will try to create a repository in GitHub.
Now, click on New repository button in the right side box.
You can see that now we are able to create repository.
Let us type: “stories” as Repository Name.
If you want to give any description about the repository, we can do so here.
Next, I will choose Public option, which is free of cost.
If we choose Private option, we have to pay some fees to keep our repository private.
This means that other users cannot find and download our repository.
Let me click on Public again.
Click on this checkbox, Initialize this repository with a README.
This will create a readme file.
In this file, you can write information about the usage of code or installation instructions.
It will be useful for all the collaborators.
However, if we are importing an existing repository, this box should be unchecked.
Now, click on Create repository button.
You can see the repository name along with your user name has been created successfully.
Once the repository is created, you can see the readme file label at the left bottom.
We will write some information in this file later.
By default, we can see a commit (i.e) Initial commit, one branch (i.e) master branch and one contributor.
You can click on each link and explore them at your convenience.
Now, let us start working in this repository.
We will begin by adding a file to our repository.
Click on New file button, in the middle panel.
A new form opens up for creating a file.
Here, I will give the file name as "kids-story.html".
I will copy and paste some code into this file, from my Writer document, which I had saved earlier.
Likewise, you can add some content into your file.
Let's commit this new file now.
Scroll down the page to give the commit message.
Here, in the commit message field, you can see the default message "Create kids-story.html".
You can keep the default message or type a new message.
I will keep the default message.
Here, in the next field, you can also give an extended description of the commit.
So here, I will type: "Added first file of the repository".
By default, we commit to the master branch.
Now click on Commit new file button.
Our new file kids-story.html is added to the repository.
Notice that now the commit number is increased to two.
Here, you can see three dots next to the commit message.
Let me click on it.
It shows the description of the commit.
To know what we have done in the commit, click on that particular commit message.
Now you can see the details of the commit.
Let’s go back to the commit list.
For this, click on the left arrow button at the top left corner of the browser.
On the right side, you can see the hash value of the commit.
Click on Code tab, at the top left corner, to come back to the repository.
Next, let me demonstrate how to create a new branch in GitHub.
In the left side, you can see a drop-down list labeled Branch.
Click on it to create a new branch.
You can see a pop-up window opens up.
In the pop-up window, you can see Find or create a branch field.
I will type: "new-chapter" as the new branch name and press Enter.
You can see that the new-chapter branch is created and it is our current branch.
Next, we will make a commit in the new-chapter branch to understand the branching process better.
Let’s make some changes in kids-story.html file for demonstration purpose.
In the repository, click on kids-story.html file to open it.
At the top right corner of the editor panel, you can see an edit icon.
Click on it to edit this file.
I will add some lines here which I have copied from my Writer document.
You can do so likewise.
Now, we will commit this change.
I will keep the default commit message as it is.
Here, you can see the branch name new-chapter where this commit was made.
To commit, click on Commit changes button.
Let’s click on Code tab to go back to our repository.
Next, let’s check the commits of master and new-chapter branches.
Click on commits link.
Here, in the Branch drop down, we can select the branch name that we want to see.
I will select master branch in the list.
Once it is selected, the commits of the master branch will be listed.
To see the commits of new-chapter branch, we will select new-chapter in the Branch drop down.
Now, you can see the commits of new-chapter branch.
Let’s click on Code tab to go back to our repository.
Next, let us see how to create a tag in GitHub.
We already know that tagging is used to mark a commit stage as important.
For example, say, I want to create a tag in the master branch after adding kids-story.html file.
To create a tag, first click on releases link.
Click on Create a new release button.
A new form opens up.
In the Tag Version box, type "V1.0".
In the Release title box, type: "Version one".
In the Write box, we can give the description of our tag.
I will type: “This is the version one”.
Now, click on Publish release button.
Here, on the left side, you can see the hash value of the latest commit.
We already know that by default, the tag will be created in the latest commit.

Hello Everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Installation of Audacity in Linux OS.
In this tutorial, we will learn about installation of
Lame library  and FFmpeg library in the Linux Operating System.
To record this tutorial I am using
Audacity version 2.1.2
Audacity is a free and open source software.
It is used for multi-track audio recording and editing.
It is available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and other operating systems.
Now let’s learn how to install Audacity in Linux OS.
Audacity comes pre-installed in Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04 and above.
However, if it is not installed on your machine, follow any one of the below methods:
Go to the terminal and type sudo apt-get install audacity
Go to Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic Package Manager, search for Audacity and install it.
To know how to install software in Linux, refer to the Linux spoken tutorials on this link
Audacity is already installed in my Linux system.
To open Audacity in Linux OS, click on Dash Home at the top left corner of the Desktop,
This is how the Audacity interface looks like.
To cross-verify the installation, we will do a small demo recording.
Click on the button with the red dot.
Narrate a sentence - For eg: Welcome to Audacity.
Now, click on the yellow button to stop the recording
If you see waveforms below, then your Audacity installation is successful.
Let’s close this window now, without saving the recording.
This completes the demo for Linux OS.
Some important things to know about Audacity.
By default Audacity, will export the audio files in few formats only. Like dot ogg, dot mp3, etc.
A plugin called "Lame" is needed in Audacity, to export into mp3 format, in Linux OS.
It also uses the "FFmpeg" plugin to be able to read/import dot mp4 files in Linux OS.
Now let us learn about Lame installation in Linux OS.
Lame allows Audacity to export audio.
In Linux OS, Audacity has built-in Lame support for .mp3 export.
Hence a separate installation of Lame is not required.
So, you should be able to export to mp3 format in Audacity in Linux OS.
Let’s move on.
FFmpeg library allow Audacity to import audio from video files.
In Linux OS, Audacity has built-in FFmpeg Library support.
Hence a separate installation of the same, is not required.
This means that you should be able to import audio from video files using Audacity in Linux OS.
Let me show you a small demo of the same.
Note: I will import the audio from a video file named as Introduction-to-LibreOffice-Writer.mov in my Desktop.
Now, click on the Dash Home and type Audacity.
This will open an empty Audacity project on your screen.
Go to the Main menu, click on the File.
Now click on Import and then on Audio.
A dialog box will appear.
It will ask you to choose the location of the file.
I will choose Desktop and select my file Introduction-to-LibreOffice-Writer.mov.
Then click on Open.
It will import only the audio from this particular video.
You can see the audio track here.

Welcome to this tutorial on Structure Analysis.
In this tutorial, we will learn to : measure distance between atoms in the structure, show Hydrogen bonds,  identify non-polar interactions,
and rotate bonds in the residues to get different rotamers.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Chimera interface. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
Here, I am using Ubuntu OS version. 14.04 ,Chimera version 1.10.2 , Mozilla firefox browser 42.0 and a working internet connection.
Using command line, open a structure of Squalene Synthase. It is a Transferace enzyme with a pdb code 3w7f.
On the command line, type Open space 3w7f. Press Enter.
A model of the enzyme is displayed on the panel.
Change the display to Interactive 1, using Presets menu.
The protein is displayed as two copies.
To delete one of the copies, type  delete colon dot a, press Enter.
To delete solvent molecules from the structure, type:  delete solvent. Press Enter.
In this structure, the ligand is farnesyl thiopyrophosphate.
Label the ligand residues using commands. Type:  rlabel space ligand. Press Enter.
There are two farnesyl thiopyrophosphate, that is, FPS for short in this structure.
The structures are shown in sticks display.
Rotate the structure and zoom-in.
There are several side chains that can donate hydrogen bonds to phosphate oxygens of FPS.
Place the cursor over the atoms in the side-chain residues.
Locate Serine 21 residue.
Now, let's measure the distance between  oxygen of Serine 21 and nearest phosphate oxygen of FPS.
To measure the distance, select oxygen of Serine 21 residue.
While pressing the CTRL key, click on the side chain oxygen of Serine 21.
While pressing CTRL and Shift keys simultaneously, double-click on the nearest phosphate oxygen of FPS.
Select Show Distance from the context menu.
Observe the panel. The distance between two atoms is displayed. Clear selection.
Similarly, measure distance between  side-chain oxygen of Tyrosine  and the same phosphate oxygen of FPS.
The distances seem consistent with hydrogen bonds.
Hydrogen bonds with donor and acceptor distances of  2.2 to 2.5 Angstroms are classified as strong, 2.5 to 3.2 as moderate, 3.2 to 4.0 as weak.
Now, select the ligand using Select menu.
Scroll down to residue option, click on FPS from the sub-menu.
The easy way to find hydrogen bonds formed by FPS is to use Find Hydrogen bond feature from Tools menu.
Click on FindHbond in the Structure Analysis option.
A H-Bond Parameters dialog opens.
Fix the color of the hydrogen bond by clicking on the colored box.
Fix the line width to 3.0 for a thicker line.
Click on the check box against Label Hydrogen bond with distance.
Click on Only find H-bonds with at least one end selected.
And, click on Write information to reply log.
Observe the panel. Hydrogen bonds are shown as pseudo-bonds of specified color and line width.
Details of the bonds can be viewed on the Reply log.
Open Reply log using Favorites menu.
Information about each hydrogen bond is given here.
If you want to remove the hydrogen bonds from the structure- on the command line, type: The Tilda symbol followed by hbond.  Press Enter.
There is another feature in the Tools menu, under Structure Analysis option.
It is Findclashes/contacts. A dialog box opens.
This feature identifies non-polar interactions such as Clashes and Contacts.
Clashes are unfavorable interactions where atoms are too close together.
Contacts are all direct interactions, polar and non-polar, favorable and unfavorable (including clashes).
Let us identify contacts of the FPS residues with all other atoms.
Select FPS residue using Select menu.
Click on Designate in the Find Clashes/Contacts dialog box.
It shows 48 atoms designated.
Click on the radio button against “All other atoms”.
Set the Clash/Contact Parameters to default Contact.
Under Treatment of Clash/Contact Atoms, click on the following check boxes.   Select, Draw pseudo-bonds, If endpoint atom hidden,  and Write information to reply log.
Click on OK button. Observe the panel.
All the contacts of FPS residues are shown.
Open the Reply Log. . Atom-atom contacts are listed here.
Now let's display some clashes.
Let us focus on the residue Tyrosine 248.
On the command line, type:  focus space colon 248. Press Enter.
Clear the selection.
Now select Tyrosine 248 residue.
While pressing the CTRL key, click on any atom in Tyrosine 248.
Press up-arrow key on the keyboard to select the entire molecule.
Now, we will rotate the side-chain Tyrosine 248 interactively and check for Clashes.
Display residues within 4 Angstroms of Tyrosine 248.
On the command line, type: display, disp space colon 248 space z less than four.  (disp :248 z<4) Press Enter.
To display the clashes, select FindClashes/Contacts option from the Tools menu.
click on Designate.
Click the button against “All other atoms”.
Set the Clash/Contact Parameters to Clash.  . The  Treatment of Clash/Contact Atoms to  Select,  Draw pseudobonds, If end point atom hidden.
And set the Frequency of Checking to Continuously.
Hide the dialog box.
To rotate the side-chain of Tyrosine 248 interactively-
while pressing CTRL key, double-click on the bond that is attached to the ribbon.
Choose rotate bond option from the context menu.
A Build structure dialog opens.
Rotate the bond by dragging the pointer on the dial.
Alternatively, click on the black arrowheads to edit the angle values.
Observe the panel. As the side-chain moves, new pseudo-bonds are formed or disappear.
To revert bond back to the original position:  click the entry under Bond. Choose Revert.
Again click on the bond then Deactivate to make the bond no longer rotate-able.
We can compare all the rotamers of Tyrosine 248 using the option in the Tools menu.
First select Tryrosine 248.
Click on Tools menu, scroll down to Structure editing.
Click on Rotamers option.
In the Rotamer dialog box, select Dunbrack from the rotamer library.
The rotamers are shown as wire representation on the panel.
Another dialog opens. Click on the lines in the dialog box to display the rotamer. Observe the panel.
We can also detect Clash and hydrogen bonds for the rotamers.
Click on Columns ,then Add.  Select Clashes.
Click on OK in the dialog box.
Now, to add Hydrogen bonds: click on Columns, scroll down to Add, and select hydrogen bonds.
Click on OK in the Hydrogen bonds dialog box.
Observe the dialog, two new columns are added.
Now each rotamer forms several Clashes but no hydrogen bonds.
Try finding rotamers by rotating bonds in a different residue.
Let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to- measure distance between atoms in the structure,
show Hydrogen bonds, identify non-polar interactions,
rotate bonds in the residues to find clashes and contacts and compare different rotamers.
For the assignment- open a structure of Squalene Synthase, pdb code 3w7f .
Rotate bonds in Tyrosine 41, residue to determine Clashes and Contacts. And compare the rotamers.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Table of Fields with Views.
In this tutorial, we will learn to create a table of fields.
We will now learn what is a Table of fields.
Suppose, we want to display a list of future events in a table like this.
Here, a user can see some details of the events and their respective dates.
The fields shown here are there in the 'Events' Content type.
Here, we display only some of the fields of some of the events.
In particular, we display only events that have dates after the current time.
Such a selected list of contents is also called as Reports or Query Results, in other programs.
Let us now create a view for a table of fields.
Go to Shortcuts, then Views and click Add new view.
We will name this as "Upcoming Events". Now change the Content of type "All" to "Events".
We can do this for any Content type – Log entries, Files, Content revisions, Taxonomy terms, Users, Custom blocks and so on.
For now, we’ll just leave it sorted by Newest first.
Put a check on Create a page and in the Display format, choose "Table" of fields.
We will keep the default value of 10 in Items to display.
Next, we will put a check on Use a pager and Create a menu link.
Under Menu, we will choose "Main navigation" and we will call the Link text as "Upcoming Events".
Our  menus are not well organized right now, but we’ll do that soon.
Click Save and edit.
Let us go through our 5 questions.
The FORMAT is a "table".
Under FIELDS, we have "Title".
In the FILTER CRITERIA we only want "Upcoming events", so we will need to change that.
SORT CRITERIA is wrong because we want to order it on the Event date and not the Published date.
To start off, let’s click Save.
In the middle, here, we have our PAGE SETTINGS.
We have the Path, the Menu, the Access Permission and now everybody will have access to the landing page.
We can add a HEADER or a FOOTER by clicking on the Add buttons here.
We can add what to do if there are no results.
We can specify how many items get shown on a page
and whether there’s a pager at the bottom or not with the Read More link at the bottom of  View.
Under the ADVANCED tab, are things that we will not cover in this tutorial.
We’ve already connected Events and User Groups.
So, we can actually  pull in information from User Groups that are sponsoring our Events and put them in this View.
This is done by using the RELATIONSHIPS and CONTEXT that we created.
Now, let us go and add the fields that we need in our table.
Click on Add and scroll down till you find the Event Date field.
I label my fields very carefully using the Content type name.
So, I can find them easily in Views later on.
Put a check mark on Event Date and click Apply.
Here, we will choose some of the settings.
For now, Create a label and Place a colon options are checked.
Let’s leave the Date format as default here; in other words "medium date".
Don’t worry about any of those right now.
And lastly, click  Apply all displays button.
So, now we have 2 columns - TITLE and EVENT DATE.
Let’s add our next field. Click Add and this time scroll down until you find Event Logo.
Select it and click Apply.
This time uncheck Create a label option.
Let’s choose an Image style of "Thumbnail".
Then, under Link image to drop-down, choose "Content".
In later tutorials, we will learn to create a new Image style for this layout. But for now, we will choose "Thumbnail".
Click Apply. Now, in the preview, we should see the thumbnails that have been generated by devel, for each Event.
Let’s go back and click on Add again. This time, scroll down and choose more than one field at a time.
Choose Event Topics and Event Website. And then click on  Apply all displays button.
On the next page, leave everything as it is and click Apply.
Notice that now we can set up 2 fields at once in Views and each one will have its own Settings screen.
Once again, click on Apply all displays.'
Now we have EVENT TOPICS and EVENT WEBSITE.
We have our title, date, topics and website. Let’s click on Save.
It’s a good habit to save your work frequently.
Let’s check.  Our Display is a Page.
Our FORMAT is a Table.
Our FIELDS are set.
The FILTER CRITERIA and SORT CRITERIA are still wrong.
To add a FILTER CRITERIA, click  Add button.
Scroll down till you find Event Date. Then, choose the Event Date and click Apply.
This screen is very important.
Under Operator drop-down, we will select "Is greater than or equal to".
Under Value type, if we put in today’s date, that would be inconvenient.
We would then have to put in a new date everyday. But we could choose "An offset of the current time..."
And, in the Value field, type the word “now”.
This means, only those events after the current time will be displayed.
The current time is not the time we are creating this. It is the time when the user is viewing it.
So, the user will only see the future events.
Click on Apply.
As we can see, the dummy contents generated by devel didn’t give us any future dates.
So, let’s manually update some of our events to make sure our View works correctly.
Find some events and change the Event Date to something in the future.
Go to Content. Filter by Events Type.
Choose any event and click on Edit. Then change the date to a future day.
Let's click on Save.
Pause the tutorial and update about 6 or 7 events.
When you’re done, come back to the tutorial.
Go to Shortcuts. Click on Views.  Find Upcoming Events. Click on Edit.
We will now go back to editing the view where we left off.
Scroll down to see the preview.
We are now filtering correctly with our Event Date being greater than or equal to now.
Next, we must check the SORT CRITERIA.
By default, Drupal sorts the content by the date of authoring in decreasing order.
For Events, it is useful to have the Event Date in ascending order.
To change this, click on Authored on and click Remove.
Click Add and once again scroll down until you find Event Date.
Click Apply.
Now, under Order, select Sort ascending. That sorts our events from today onwards.
Click Apply.
Now we have updated our Events and set the Sort Criteria correctly.
We should be able to see a listing that looks something like this.
All the events that are coming up in the future, are listed in EVENT DATE order.
Make sure you click Save, before we move on.
So, there is one more thing that we are going to do with this particular View.
Let’s combine the TITLE and Logo columns and then let’s make the TITLE and EVENT DATE sortable.
When we do this, a user can click on the TITLE and it will sort by that feature.
Scroll back up. Locate FORMAT > Table and next to it, click on the word Settings.
In the Content Event Logo, change the COLUMN drop-down to "Title".
For the SEPARATOR, up here, just put a simple line break.
Make Title and Event Date columns SORTABLE in Ascending order and click Apply.
So, now our Title and logo are in the same column and both TITLE and EVENT DATE are now sortable.
Let’s change that word Title to Event Name.
Click on the word "Title" and in the Label, change the word "Title" to "Event Name".
Scroll down to the preview area. Our Event Name and logo and date are all set.
In later tutorials, we will learn to change the size of our logos to make this a little bit nicer.
For now, click Save and let’s test our View.
Click on Back to site to go to the Homepage.
Click on Upcoming Events.
You should see a table nicely laying out the events that are coming up only in the future.
You can also see that you can sort by Event Name and Event Date.
With this, we have completed our first Table View.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about creating tables of fields.

Welcome to  Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany.
Here, I select black as my Foreground colour and you can see that the value of Hue, Saturation, Value, Red, Green, Blue all are zero.
If you want a light colour then adjust the Saturation slider and if you want a good mixture of strong colours then slide the Value slider accordingly and select an amount in Red, Green or Blue slider.
I can change the amount of Blue in the colours I want to have and then the amount of Red and Green in the same way.
I think this dialog is useful only for professional printers and printers use Cyan, Magenta and Yellow instead of Red, Green and Blue and that is because they substract the colours.
If I want to print the black colour then I can set Cyan, Meganta & Yellow to 100 and I get fully black paper.
To avoid mismatch with blue, it is set as 'K' for Black.
This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to Receive Serials.
In this tutorial, we will learn: How to receive Serials,
To record this tutorial, I am using:Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04 and
To receive Serials, let’s login to Koha as Superlibrarian Bella and her password.
On the homepage, click on Serials.
At the top of the new page, locate the field for Title.
Enter the first or any word from the title of the journal. For example, I will type Indian.

In this table, under the section Status, click on the drop-down and select Arrived.
Next, click on the Save button at the bottom of the page.
Another page opens with the heading: Serial collection information for Indian Journal of Microbiology.
In this way, we can receive Serials.
Now, let’s learn how to Claim late Serials.
Koha can send email messages to the Serials vendors if there are late issues.
In such a case, a claim can be sent for issue no.3 that is still to be received.
To the left of the main Serials page, there is an option named 'Claims’.
Click on Claims.
A new page opens with a dialog box:
A new page Notices and Slips opens.
Under Notices and Slips, locate the tab Select a library:.
I will select Spoken Tutorial Library.
Under the tab Select a library:, click on the tab New notice.
A new page opens with the heading Add notice.
On the same page, for the section Library, Koha will, by default, choose the library name.
In my case, it will choose Spoken Tutorial Library.

As I have only one vendor for Journals, I will go ahead with the vendor- Mumbai Journal Supplier.
Next, click on OK at the right side of the field.
A new page with the title Missing issues opens.
On the new page, click on the check- box on the left side for Mumbai Journal Supplier.
You may click the check-box as per your vendor.
Next, click on Send notification button at the bottom of the page.
The same page re-opens and with this an email is sent to the vendor.
Note that the email is sent from Koha server to the respective vendor.
We will now learn about Check expiration.
Check expiration is used for checking when the subscriptions are about to expire.
On the same page, go to the left side and click on Check expiration.
Check expiration page opens.
Now, under the section for Filter results, go to Library: and from the drop-down, select Spoken Tutorial Library.
Next, mention the Expiring before.
This will fetch a complete list of all the Journals that would expire before that particular date.
For Expiring before:, I will enter 01/01/2019.
On the same page, a list of journals that are due to expire by 01/01/2019, appear in a tabular form.
We can also see the following details-
Now, under the tab Actions, click on the button Renew.
A new window with the heading Subscription renewal for Indian Journal of Microbiology opens up.
On this page, enter the following:
Next is Subscription length.
It is suggested to fill in one of the three fields, namely-

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “My first HTML program”.
In this tutorial we will learn:
Write a sample HTML program
Save and run the HTML program
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or Text Editor and a Web Browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML 5
gedit Text Editor and  Firefox web browser
However you may, use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
Now we will see how to create and run simple HTML programs.
First open your text editor.
I have already opened my gedit Text Editor.
Let us start to write our HTML code.
For this demo, I have already written a code and will be explaining the same.
The same file is available in the Code Files link, as mentioned earlier.
DOCTYPE html
Here in the DOCTYPE tag, I have mentioned the type of the document as HTML.
Make sure that, you have written the keyword DOCTYPE in capital letters.
Next comes the html section, which has our actual content.
The HTML code has to be written between these two tags.
After the html tag, we have the head section.
The head section contains the header information of the page like-
I have mentioned the title of this page as “Farmer's market” with the help of Title tag.
After the head section, comes the body section.
The body section is the one which has the content to be displayed on the webpage.
For this demo, I have written a welcome message, with the help of h1 heading tag.
While writing your HTML code, please use proper indentation.
Our code is ready. So let’s save this file now.
I’ll press Ctrl + S keys on my keyboard.
Now choose the desired location to save your file.
I will select Desktop on my machine.
Here I will create a folder with the help of “Create Folder” button and name it as my hyphen html.
This folder will help me to organize my html files in a single location on my machine.
I will save the name of the file as MyFirstPage.html
Please note that the HTML files has to be saved with either .html or .htm extension.
Lastly, click on the Save button.
Let’s confirm this.
Here is the folder my hyphen html which I had created.
Double-click on it to see what it contains.
And here is our html file.
We have successfully created our HTML file and saved it.
Now let’s see how to run it.
Right-click on the file and select Open With option.
Then choose any web browser that is available.
This will open our HTML file in the Firefox web browser.
The webpage opens.
But instead of our HTML code, we see only the text which we mentioned in the body section.
Notice the browser’s title - it says Farmer's market.
This is the text we had mentioned in the head section.
The browser interprets the tags we used and displays only the content.
In this tutorial, we have learnt
Write a sample HTML program and
Set the title as My Assignment
It has to display “Welcome to my first html page”
Open the HTML page in a web browser and see the output.
The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops using spoken tutorials.
The Spoken Tutorial forum is for specific questions on this tutorial.
Please do not post unrelated and general questions on them.
Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by MHRD, Government of India.
This is Praveen from IIT Bombay signing off.
Let's say while a variable '$num' is smaller or equal to 10 and under echo I can say: $num ++.
we are going to say 'num' less than or equal to (<=) 10;  if 'yes' then echo Loop and then say add 1 on to the variable 'num'.
So, we said this 1 and see what we  will we get. Okay, we got  Loop 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times.
Thanks for watching.  This is Sidharth for the Spoken Tutorial Project, signing off.  Goodbye.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “E-card animation” using Synfig.
In this tutorial, we will learn to create an E-card animation using some png images.
Here, we will learn to-  import png format images,
animate the images,
do text animation,
preview the animation,
render the animation in avi format.
For this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 14.04 OS,
Now, let us start creating the e-card animation.
We need to first save our Synfig file.
Go to File  and click on Save.
Select the folder in which  to save.
Type the filename as E-card-animation  and click on the Save button .
First we will  go to the Toolbox and click on the Rectangle tool.
Then draw a rectangle on the canvas as demonstrated.
We will change the settings such that the imported image fits inside the canvas.
To do so, go to Edit. Click on Preferences and then on Misc.
Click on the option Scaling new imported image to fix canvas.
Now, click on  Ok.   This option will import the images such that they fit within the canvas.
Please note: We need to import the images in png format.
This is because other image formats like jpg/jpeg behave differently on the Synfig canvas.
Also, after rendering, the output quality is better when png images are used.
Let’s come back to the Synfig interface.
I have saved the required images in the E-card-animation folder, inside my Documents folder.
These images are provided in the Code files link, on this webpage itself.
Please  locate the link “Code files” and save the images on your machine.
Now, practise along with me.
Select the Bg image and click on Import.
We get the Bg image on the canvas.
To resize the image- first hold the orange dot or the orange duck and move the mouse in or out as shown, to make the Bg image fit the canvas.
Now, select the Cake image in the folder and click on Import.
We get the Cake image on our canvas. In the same way, import all the other images too.
Observe, we have three new layers named - Cake, Flowers and Balloons.
Let us now resize these images.  Go to Layers panel.
First select the Cake layer. Observe that on selection, the resize handles appear on the canvas.
Click on the orange dot and resize the Cake image.
Repeat the same process and resize the other two images also.
Now, move the images and keep them outside the canvas, as demonstrated.
Then go to the Animation panel. Click on Turn on animate editing mode icon.
Place the Time cursor on  30
Select the Cake layer.
Move the Cake image to the left bottom of the canvas, as shown.
Next, select the Balloons layer.
Place the Time cursor on the 30
Go to Keyframes panel and click on Add a keyframe.
Now, place the Time cursor on the 48
Go to Keyframes panel and click on Add a keyframe.
Move the Balloons image to the mid-left of the canvas.
Again, place the Time cursor on the 60
Go to Keyframes panel and click on Add a keyframe.
Move the Flowers image to the right bottom of the canvas.
Next, we will add a line of text to go with this animation.
Before that, let me switch off the animation.
To do so, click on Turn off animate editing mode icon.
Let us add the text. Since the default Fill colour is white, the text will not be visible on the white background.
So, I will change this colour to black.
Now, go to the Toolbox and click on the Text Tool.
Then click anywhere on the canvas. We get Input text dialog box.
Here, we will type the text “Happy Birthday”.
Click on Ok.
Observe that we can now see the text on the canvas.
Now, go to the Layers panel and select the text layer.
Next go to the Parameters panel and click on Size.
Change its value to 80 pixels and then change the colour value  to violet.
Go to the Toolbox and click on the Text Tool. Once again click on the canvas.
We get another Input text dialog box.
In this text box, type: “Have a wonderful, happy, healthy birthday now and forever”.
And then click on Ok. We can now see this text also on the canvas.
Go to the Parameters panel and click on Size.
Change the value to 30 pixels and change the colour to black.
Now, let’s go to the Layers panel.
Click on the first text layer and change the name of that layer to Happy Birthday.
Similarly, click on the other text layer and change the layer name to Now and Forever.
It is a good habit  to name the layers appropriately.
This will help us to locate them easily in the future.
Now, move the text layers outside the canvas, as demonstrated.
Then, go to Layers panel. Select the  Happy Birthday layer.
Now,  Place the Time cursor on the 72nd frame.
Go to Keyframes panel and click on Add a keyframe. Move the text as demonstrated.
Next, go to the Layers panel and select Now and forever layer.
Then place the Time cursor on the 90
Go to Keyframes panel and click on Add a keyframe once again.
Now, go to the canvas and move the text Now and forever as demonstrated.
Now save our Synfig file.
Go to File and click on Save.
Let us now check the preview. Go to File and then click on Preview.
Set the quality as 0.5 and FPS as 24.
Click on the Preview button. Then click on the Play button.
We can see a preview of the animation on the screen.
Close the Preview window.
Lastly, let us render the animation.

Welcome to this tutorial on Types of Symmetry in GeoGebra.
In this tutorial we will learn about various types of symmetry like:
Rotation
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with, the Geogebra interface.
Let us begin with the definition of symmetry.
A geometric figure is symmetric, if it can be divided into two or more identical parts and its parts can be arranged in an organized manner.
I have already opened the GeoGebra interface.
For this tutorial I will uncheck the axes.
To do so, right-click on the Graphics view.
In this menu, uncheck the Axes check box.
For this tutorial, we will use all the tools available under the Reflect about Line tool.
Now we will define line symmetry.
A figure has line symmetry, if one half of the object is the mirror image of the other half.
The line over which the figure is reflected is called the line of symmetry.
To draw a vertical line AB, click on the Segment tool and then click on Graphics view.
Point A is drawn in the Graphics view.
Click again directly below point A to draw segment AB.
Select the Semicircle through 2 Points tool.
Click on the left-side of segment AB. Point C is drawn.
A gain click below C to complete the semicircle CD named as c.
This semicircle should be to the left of segment f.
Now let us reflect the semicircle about the segment f.
Click on the Reflect about Line tool.  Click on the semicircle, then click on line f.
Semicircle c'(c prime) appears on the right side of segment f. It is a reflected image of semicircle c.
Let's change the object properties of c and c'(c prime).
Right-click on c and select Object Properties.
Preferences window opens.
In the left panel under Conic, c is already selected.
While holding the Ctrl key, click on c'(c prime).
In the Basic tab, click the Show Trace check box.
In the Color tab, I will  choose the colour as pink.
You may choose any colour of your choice. Then close the Preferences window.
Using the Move tool, drag the semicircle c .
Observe that semicircle c'(c prime) moves as we move  c.
c'(c prime) is the mirror image of c, with segment f as the mirror.
To erase the traces, drag the Graphics view.
Let us delete all the objects in the Graphics view.
Press Ctrl + A  keys to select all the objects.
Then press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Now let us learn to reflect about a point.
Click on Segment  tool.
Click within the Graphics view twice to draw a segment AB.
Select the Reflect about Point tool. Click on point A, then on point B.
A'(A prime)which is the reflected image of A,  appears on the otherside of point B.
To view A' (A prime), drag the Graphics view if required.
To show that A'(A prime) is the image of A, we will measure the distances AB and A'(A prime)B.
Under Angle, click on the Distance or Length tool.
Click on point A, then on B.
Again click on A' (A prime) and then on B.
Notice that the distances AB and A'(A prime)B  are equal.
Using Move tool, I will drag segment AB upwards.
Observe that A'(A prime) also moves along with AB.
Now we will learn to reflect a point about a circle.
Select the Circle with centre and radius tool.  Click within the Graphics view.
The Circle with Centre and Radius text box appears.
In the text box type  Radius as 2 and click on the OK button at the bottom.
A circle with centre C and radius 2 cm is drawn in the Graphics view.
Using Point tool, draw a point D outside the circle.
Select the Reflect about Circle tool. Click on point D and then click on circle c.
D'(D prime), which is the image of D, appears inside the circle.
Click on the Move tool and drag point D around the circle.
Observe that D'(D prime) also moves inside the circle mirroring D.
Drag point D inside the circle and see what happens. D and D'(D prime)exchange places.
Now let us learn about rotational symmetry.
An object has rotational symmetry, if  it can be rotated about a fixed point without changing the overall shape.
Let us open a new GeoGebra window.
Click on  File  and then on New Window.
We will now rotate an object around a point.  For this, I will draw a square.
Click on the Polygon tool.
Click within the Graphics view to draw point A.  Similarly draw points B, C and D.
To complete the polygon click again on point A.
A quadrilateral ABCD named as q1 is drawn.
To convert q1 to a square, we have to adjust the lengths.
Click on the Move tool and drag the points A, B, C and D.
Notice the change in the lengths in the Algebra view. All the lengths have to be same.
We will now draw perpendicular bisectors to the square.
Click on Perpendicular Bisector tool.
Click on points A, B and B, C.
The two perpendicular bisectors intersect at a point.
Click on Intersect tool and click on point of intersection. Point E  is the point of intersection.
Let us create an angle slider.  Click on Slider tool and click in the Graphics view.
The Slider dialog box appears.
Select Angle radio button.
Alpha appears in the Name field.
Leave the default values of Min, Max  and Increment as they are.
Alpha slider is created in the Graphics view.
Now click on the Rotate around Point tool. Click on the square q1 and then point E.
Rotate around Point text box appears with 45 degrees angle.
Below the text box we have, counter clockwise and clockwise radio buttons.
You can select any one of the radio buttons as per your choice.
Delete 45 degrees from the Angle text box.
In the Angle text box, notice an alpha symbol on the rightside.
Click on it to show the table of symbols.
Select alpha from the table and click on the OK button at the bottom.
Observe that a new square q1' appears in the Graphics view.
This square q1'  is rotated at angle alpha with respect to square q1.
Now drag the alpha slider between 0 degrees to 360 degrees.
As we drag, notice the rotation of q1' around the point E.
Let us now delete all the objects.
Go to Edit menu and navigate to Select All.
Next we will move an object using a vector.
Let us define translational symmetry
An object has translational symmetry if, it can be moved without changing its overall shape.
Using the Polygon tool draw a triangle ABC named as t1.
To draw a vector, click on the Vector tool from the tool bar.
Click on point D and then on point E.
The vector is represented by u.
Select Translate by Vector  tool. Click on the triangle t1 and then on the vector u.
Here t1'  is the translated image of t1.
The distance between t1 and t1' is exactly same as the length of vector u.
Using the Move tool, drag point E of the vector u.
Translate a point using Translate by Vector tool.
Measure the distance between the original point and the translated point.
Let us define scale symmetry.
An object has scale symmetry if,  it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted.
Let us open a new Geogebra window.  Click on File and select New Window.
Now let us learn how to dilate an object.
Click on the Circle with centre and radius tool. Then click on the Graphics view.
Type radius as 1 in the Circle with Centre and Radius text box.
Click on OK  button at the bottom.
Using Point tool draw a point B outside the circle.
Select the Dilate from Point tool.
Click on the circumference of the unit circle then click on point B.
The Dilate from Point text box appears. Type the Factor as 2 and click on the OK button at the bottom.
A dilated circle with double the radius appears in the Graphics view.
Dilate the pentagon by a factor of 0.5

Let us click on Iron(Fe) button.
Its elemental window opens.
Click on the Radii tab.
Ionic radii table has an extra column named Spin.
Spin column gives idea about complex formation tendency of Iron.
Here, High means spin free complexes where electrons are unpaired.
Low means spin paired complexes where electrons are paired up.
I will close Iron(Fe) elemental window.
More details about complex formation are available at this link
Click again on the Elemental window of Carbon.
Click on Thermodynamics tab
This tab shows Melting Point and Boiling point of Carbon.
Explore Show curve button on your own.
I will close the Carbon elemental window.
Now let's move on to Color schemes.
Go to View menu and select Color schemes.
A sub-menu opens with a list of Color schemes.
Click on No colors.
All element buttons turn to grey.
Click on  Color Schemes and select Physical states.
A new Periodic table opens with elements buttons in "Blue" color.
Except for some in "Black".
On the top, you can see  Temperature(K): scale slider with "zero(0)" as minimum value.
Below, you can see colors of "Solid-Blue", "Liquid-Green" and "Gas-Red".
At zero degree Kelvin all the elements are in solid state.
So they appear in 'blue' color.
Let us drag the slider to increase the temperature.
Notice that elements change their Physical state.
"Blue" color is replaced by Green(liquid) and Red(Gas) colors.
At 6010 degree Kelvin(six thousand ten) all the elements change to gaseous state.
All the buttons change to "Red" color.
Some elements are shown in "black" background.
Their state is unknown at that Temperature.
Next let's select Family.
Selected Family drop down button appears.
Drop down list has various families with their corresponding colors.
By default All is selected.
Each Family of elements appear in a specific Family color.
Click on the drop down list and select Metalloids.
Metalloids  appear in Green family background color.
Rest all elements appear in "black" background.
Go back to Color Scheme, select Electronegativity color scheme.
Elements with 'red' color have lowest  Electronegativity values.
Elements with 'blue' color have highest Electronegativity values.
There is gradual change in the color from 'red' to 'blue'.
Elements with 'pink' color have in between Electronegativity values.
If no data is available in the database, the element will have a "black" background.
Let us select Block.
Elements of each Block appear with allotted block color:
's' block  – blue

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Strings  in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is a string.
Declaration of a string.
Initialization of a string.
Few examples on string.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
Let us start with the introduction to strings.
String is a sequence of characters that is treated as a single data item.
Size of string = length of string + 1.
Let me tell you how to declare a string.
The syntax for this is
char, name of string and size.
char is the data type, name of the string is the string name, and we can give the size here.
Eg: here we have declared a character string names with size 10.
Now we will see an example.
I have already typed the program,  I will open it.
Note that our file name is string.c
In this program, we will take a string as an input from the user and print it.
These are our header files.
Here string.h includes the declarations, functions, constants of string handling utilities.
Whenever we work on string functions, we should include this header file.
Here we are declaring the string strname with size  30.
Here we are accepting a string from the user.
To read a string, we can use scanf() function with format specifier %s.
We are using the caret sign and \n to include the spaces with the string.
Then we print the string.
Now click on Save.
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
To compile, type gcc space string.c space -o space str
And press Enter .
To execute, type ./str  (dot slash str).
Here it is displayed as Enter the string .
I will type "Talk To A Teacher".
The output is displayed as  The string is Talk To A Teacher.
Until now we discussed about the declaration of a string.
Now we are going to discuss how to initialize the string.
The syntax for this is,
char var_name[size] = “string”;
Eg: Here we have declared a character string  “names” with size 10 and the string is “Priya”"
Another syntax is,
char var_name[ ] = {'S', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'}  within single quotes.
eg: char names[10] = {'P', 'r', 'i', 'y', 'a'}  in single quotes.
Let me show you how to use the first syntax with an example.
Switch back to our Editor. We will use the same example.
First, press shift, ctrl and s keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with the name stringinitialize.
Now click on Save.
We are going to initialize the string.
Hence, at the 5th line, type
= and within the double quotes “Spoken-Tutorial”;
Now, click on Save .
Now remove these two lines, as we are only going to print the string.
To compile, type
gcc space stringinitialize.c space -o space str2
Here we have str2 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter str for the file string.c.
To execute, type ./str2
The output is displayed as  "The string is Spoken-Tutorial".
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across .
Suppose, here we type the spelling of string as sting.
Now click on Save.
Now compile as before.
We see an fatal error.
sting.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
This is because the compiler is not able to find the header file with the name sting.h .
Type r here.
Now click on Save. Let us execute again.
Compile as before, execute as before.
Yes, it is working!
Now, let us see another common error.
Suppose, here I will type int in place of char.
Now, click on Save .Let us see what happens.
Compile as before.
We see an error.
Wide character array initialized from non-wide string .
format %s expects argument of type 'char' but  argument 2 has type 'int' .
This is because we used  %s as the format specifier for string.
And we are initializing it with an integer data type.
Type char here.
Compile as before, execute as before.
Yes, it is working!
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.
Let me open our file string.c.
We will edit the code here.
First, press shift, ctrl and S keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension .cpp (dot cpp).
and click on Save.
Now we will change the header file as  iostream.
Include the using statement.
Now click on Save.
Now we will delete this declaration.
And will declare a string variable.
Type string space strname and a semicolon.
Replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Delete the closing bracket here.
Delete the scanf statement and type getline opening bracket closing bracket, within the brackets type (cin, strname) .
At the end, type a semicolon.
Now again, replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Delete the format specifier and \n .
Now delete the comma.
Type two opening angle brackets, delete the bracket here.
Type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type \n .
And click on Save.
Here we have declared a string variable 'strname' .
Since we do not use the format specifier in C++, the compiler should know that 'strname' is a string variable.
Here we use getline to extract the characters from the input sequence.
It stores them as a string.
To compile, type
g++ space string.cpp space -o space str3
To execute, type ./str3 (dot slash str3).
Press Enter. It is displayed as Enter the string.
I will enter as Talk To A Teacher .
"The string is Talk To A Teacher"
We can see that the output is similar to our C code.
Now come back to our slides. Let us summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt: Strings
Declaration of a string
eg: char strname[30]
Initialization of a string eg: char strname[30] = “Talk To A Teacher”
write a program to print a string using the 2nd syntax.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on stashing and cleaning in Git.
In this tutorial, we will learn about stashing.
We will learn how to:
To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of Git commands and branching in Git.
Let us learn about stashing.
Stashing is used to save temporary changes of a branch.
It helps to pause the current work without committing it, when switching branches.
Stash of the temporary changes can be revoked at any time.
Recall that we already came across the term stash, earlier in this tutorial series.
Now, let’s learn it in more detail.
Let us begin by opening the terminal.
We will open our Git repository mywebpage which we created earlier.
I will continue to use html files for demonstration. You may use any file type of your choice.
First, we will check the branch list by typing git space branch.
I have already created a branch named chapter-three.
I have done a commit inside it, for demonstration purpose.
Please make sure that you also create a new branch and make a commit inside it.
We will go into the branch chapter-three by typing git space checkout space chapter-three.
Let’s check the Git log.
This is the commit which I made in the chapter-three branch for demonstration.
Let’s check the folder content by typing "ls".
If you are working in Windows operating system, use "dir" command in place of "ls" command.
Note that here we have three html files.
Now, we’ll make some changes on the file mypage.html.
Let us open the file mypage.html by typing gedit space mypage.html space ampersand.
I will copy and paste some lines into this file, from my Writer document, which I had saved earlier.
To check the Git status, type: git space status
We can understand that our changes are not staged yet.
When we work in a big project, we may need to switch branches frequently.
Now, let’s say, we want to go back to our master branch to work on something else.
Type: git space checkout space master.
This error shows that we can't switch back to other branches without committing the changes.
I don't want to commit the changes right now, as my work is just half-done.
If we will forcefully exit this branch using the hyphen hyphen force flag, the changes will get discarded.
But, what if I want to save the changes temporarily? This will be done using Stashing.
We can save the changes temporarily by typing git space stash space save space within double quotes “Stashed mypage.html”.
Here, “Stashed mypage.html” is the stash name I have given. You can name it as per your preference.
On the terminal, the stash name and the branch name where the stash is created, are displayed.
We will check the Git status by typing  git space status. You can see the message “nothing to commit”.
So, we can switch branches now.
Now, let's try to go into master branch by typing git space checkout space master.
Note that after stashing, we can switch to other branches.
Next, let us see another way of stashing.
For that, again I will go to chapter-three branch by typing git space checkout space chapter-three.
Now, I will edit the file history.html. Type: gedit space history.html space ampersand.
I will add some lines from my Writer document here.
Let's check the Git status by typing  git space status.
Say, for example, in stash, I want to save these changes in another way. Type: git space stash.
Note that we didn't give the stash name here.
If we don't give the stash name, the stash will be saved in the name of the latest commit.
Next, we will check whether the stash name and the latest commit are same.
Let's check the Git log first.
To check the stash list, type: git space stash space list.
You can see that the latest commit and the latest stash name are same.
Note that the latest stash is listed first which means the stashes are listed in chronological order.
This is the stash id which will be generated automatically.
I will create one more stash for demonstration purpose.
For that, I will edit the file story.html. Type:  gedit space story.html space ampersand.
I will add some lines in the file story.html.
Now, I will save the changes in a stash.
Type: git space stash space save space within double quotes “Stashed story.html”.
Let's check the stash list by typing git space stash space list.
We can see that now we have three stashes in the chapter-three branch.
In certain situations, we may not remember what changes we have saved in the stashes.
Let us see how to check it.
Say, for example, I want to see the details of stash@{0}.
So, type: git space diff space stash at the rate (@) symbol within curly brackets zero.
We can see the changes of story.html.  That is what we saved in stash@{0}.
Next, we will continue to work on the stashed files.
For that, first we have to apply the stashes.
To check the stash list, type: git space stash space list.
For example, now we will apply the stash@{1}.
To do so, type git space stash space apply space stash @ (at the rate symbol) within curly brackets one.
If you don't mention the stash id, the latest stash (i.e) stash@{0} will be applied.
You can see that our stash is applied successfully.
Let's check the stash list by typing git space stash space list.
We can see the stash@{1}, still in the list and this may lead to confusion in future.
So, after applying a stash, it is better to delete it manually.
To delete the stash@{1}, type: git space stash space drop space stash@ (at the rate symbol) within curly brackets one.
To check the stash list, type: git space stash space list.
We can see that our stash@{1} is removed. And stash@{2} became stash@{1}.
Now, we will learn to apply a stash in another way. Type: git space stash space pop.
We can see that our stash@{0} is applied.
So, if we use stash pop command, the most recent stash (i.e) stash@{0} will be applied.
Again, we will check the stash list by typing git space stash space list.
Now, we can see that stash@{0} is removed. And, stash@{1} became stash@{0}.
So, the stash pop command will apply the stash@{0} and delete it automatically.
Next, we will learn how to remove all the stashes at once.
To delete all the stashes from our repository, type: git space stash space clear.
Again, we will check the stash list by typing git space stash space list.
We can see that our stash list is empty now.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about Stashing.
As an assignment-  Create three stashes in your repository.
Explore the command git stash show.
Understand the difference between the commands git stash show and git stash show stash@{1}.
Apply the latest stash (Use – git stash pop)
and delete all the stashes from the repository.

Here is an assignment for you-
This tutorial has been contributed by DesiCrew Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
“Congratulations. Please be seated.”
“Anita, when was your last appointment?”
It was around 2 months back.
Now, I am into my 4th month of pregnancy.
“Regular checkups are necessary in cases of pregnancy.”
Check-ups during pregnancy is a preventive care towards potential health problems.
This will help in reducing complications during pregnancy.
“Frequency of check-ups should be every 3 months and it should be weekly in the last month of pregnancy.”
Check-ups provide information about:
maternal psychological changes
prenatal nutrition & diet
vitamins and
biological changes.
“It is my first time and I am new to all this.
Please advise me on taking better care of myself and the baby.”
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on prenatal health care.
Here, we will talk about health care for an expectant mother during pregnancy.
First and foremost is the health of the mother.
Hence the prevention of iron deficiency is very important.
Expectant mothers should take iron-rich food during pregnancy.
“During pregnancy, the need for blood in your body increases.
You need more iron to make hemoglobin for the additional blood required by your baby.
Hence you should take iron rich foods such as:
green vegetables
egg yolks dried fruits
beans and iron rich cereals”.
Caesarean delivery has many risks like:
infection in the incision site and
blood loss which can cause anemia.
Pregnant women must try to have a normal delivery.
This is possible by taking proper prenatal care and having healthy diet.
Exercise well as this is important to boost your energy level.
Exercise also relieves you from back problems, reduces constipation and helps relieve stress.
“What does this machine do?”
"This is a Sonography machine.
It is used to monitor the health and development of the baby.”
“Anita, please lie down so that I can demonstrate the importance of sonography.”
“Sonography is performed usually at 20 weeks of pregnancy.
It is used to detect - if the placenta is healthy and
whether the baby is growing properly inside the uterus."
“This helps detect serious problems like low birth weight of baby.
It also helps to prevent miscarriage and even abortion, to a great extent.”
For proper health care during pregnancy, the following are important -
Regular check-ups
Importance of Sonography
Iron deficiency prevention & good nutrition
Information on Caesarian birth
Importance of exercise.
“Thank you doctor for giving a lot of information. We promise to follow your instructions.”
"I am so proud of you both for taking good care during pregnancy.
Because of this, the baby and the mother are healthy and happy.”
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Remember to take good care and to eat nutritious food during pregnancy.
Thanking you for listening and STAY SAFE.

Thank you for joining me in this tutorial.
Let us call Math by clicking Insert menu, then Object and then Formula.
In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or symbols which are called elements.
'Math' has separate mark up to represent a matrix and its rows and columns of elements.
I have the examples written already so as to save time. I will copy and paste them. Now, we’ll learn how to write a 2 by 3 matrix.
This matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.
We will use the markup matrix and include all its elements within curly brackets, in the Formula Editor window.
Notice that the elements in a row are separated by one hash symbol
and the rows are separated by two hash symbols.
Use parentheses to enclose the matrix in brackets.
Now, notice that the brackets are short and do not cover all the elements in the matrix entirely.
They are of the same size as each element and hence are not scalable to the size of the matrix.
To solve this, we can use the words ‘Left’ and ‘Right’.
i.e. 'Left', just before open bracket and 'Right', before close bracket to make the brackets scalable.
Let me copy and paste the next example.
So, a 4 by 1 matrix will look like as shown on the screen.
Notice the scalable brackets in the Writer gray box.
The markup for the matrix is as shown on the screen.
Here, we can also use square brackets instead of parentheses.
So, using the matrix mark up, we can write matrices of any dimensions.
Now, let us write an example for matrix addition.
Let us go to a new line in the Formula Editor window.
We can press the Enter key twice to add two blank lines.
First, let us write two example 2 by 3 matrices, side by side, as shown on the screen.
Next, let us add a plus symbol in between these two matrices to denote addition.
To do this, we can simply click between the gap of these two matrices in the Writer Gray box.
Notice that the cursor in the Formula Editor Window is placed roughly between the two matrix mark ups here.
Type plus (+) in between these two matrices.
So, there is the plus symbol (+).
Next, let us add an equal to symbol (=) at the end with long gaps.
And then, the third matrix on the right, denoting the addition.
Notice that we have used Greek characters in our example.
So, there is the result of the addition of two matrices.
Let us save our work.
Next, let us see an example of multiplying a matrix by a number.
We will write a 2 by 3 matrix and multiply it by 4.
We will first write 4 times, followed by the matrix.
Let me copy the matrix and paste it in FEW.
Next, let us write the equal to (=) symbol at the end with long gaps
followed by the matrix product. I am copying and pasting the mark up for the matrix product.
So, there is the product of multiplying a 2 by 3 matrix by a number.
Now, we can format matrices by clicking on the Format menu and choosing the Fonts, Font Size, Alignment or the Spacing.
For example, let us choose Spacing.
In the Category drop-down, on the right, let us choose Matrices
and change the Line spacing to 20 percent and column spacing to 50 percent. Click OK.
Notice, how the matrices and their elements are well spaced out.
Let us save our work now by clicking on File and Save.
Now, we can also use matrices to write two or three equations and then align them on a particular character.
For example, we can write simultaneous equations and align them on the equal to character.
Let us write a set of simultaneous equations now, as shown on the screen.
Notice that they are not perfectly aligned on the equal to character.
So, here we can use the matrix mark-up to align them.
We can separate each part in the equation and treat the parts as elements of a matrix.
Here, '2x' is a part, 'y' is a part, equal to character is a part and so on.
Press Enter twice. Copy and paste the mark up.
And, thus the new mark up looks like as shown on the screen.
Here, we have used the matrix mark up, treated each part of the equation as an element and separated them by # (hash) symbols.
We have used the double hash symbols to separate the two equations.
So, there is a perfectly aligned set of equations.
Let us write another set of equations.
Here, let us suppose that we don’t have equal number of parts on the left and the right of the equal to character.
Notice the equations on the screen and they are not aligned on the equal to character.
Let us rewrite the mark up to align them. Press Enter twice. I am copying and pasting the markup.
So here, we have used alignr and alignl to align the parts to the right and the left of the equal to character.
And, there is our perfectly aligned set of equations.
Write steps for multiplying a 2x3 matrix by a 3x1 matrix. Use formatting to change the font sizes and the spacing.
Write a set of three equations. Align the equations at the equal to (=) character.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Matrix and Aligning equations in LibreOffice Math.
Write a Matrix and * Align equations on a particular character.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Binary Phase Envelope in DWSIM.
In this tutorial, we will learn to generate:  Txy plot at given pressure,
xy plot for the obtained Txy data,
Pxy plot at given temperature.
To record this tutorial, I am using  DWSIM 5.2 (Classic UI) and   Windows 10.
The process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS also, such as-
To practice this tutorial, you should know to : add components to a flowsheet,
Select thermodynamic packages,
add material streams and specify their properties.
The pre-requisite tutorials are mentioned on our website.
In this tutorial, using DWSIM, we will generate:  Txy plot at a constant pressure of 1.013 bar,
xy plot for the obtained Txy data,
Pxy plot at a constant temperature of 75 degree centigrade.
Here we give compounds, inlet stream conditions and property package.

Under Flowsheet Object, select Feed.
At the bottom, click on the Add Utility button.
Once again, Binary Phase Envelope window opens.
Let us adjust the window for better visibility.
Enter Name as Pxy-plot.
Go to Diagram Settings.
Let the Compound settings be the default settings.
Select Envelope type as Pxy.
Select X-Axis Basis as Mole Fraction, if not already selected.
By default, Mole Fraction is selected as X-Axis Basis.
Enter Temperature as 75 degree Centigrade.
Here, we are going to plot a Pxy diagram.
So, let us not worry about the temperature value.
Make sure that the property package is selected as Soave-Redlich-Kwong.
Now, click on Calculate button at the bottom.
The diagram generated is a Pxy diagram or Constant Temperature Phase Diagram.
X-axis indicates the mole fraction of Ethanol.
Y -axis indicates the pressure range for which the VLE is generated.
The lower line of the envelope represents Dew Points.
Hover the mouse to the lower line at Ethanol mole fraction of 0.4.
We can see the dew point pressure to be 0.523 bar.
For any mixture composition below this line, is completely vapour.
The upper line of the envelope represents Bubble Points.
Hover the mouse to the upper line at Ethanol mole fraction of 0.8.
We can see the bubble point pressure to be 0.782 bar.
For any mixture composition above this line, is completely liquid.
The area enclosed between these two lines is the VLE region.
Here, both vapor and liquid phases exist in equilibrium.
Now, go to Results section.  Click on Table.
Here we can see the corresponding mole fractions and pressure values.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to generate:   Txy plot at given pressure,
xy plot for the obtained Txy data,
Pxy plot at given temperature.
As an assignment, generate P(xy) plot for the Pxy data obtained.
Generate  P(xy) plot using NRTL model.
Compare the results.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Command line arguments and Quoting in BASH.
Command line Arguments and
Quoting.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with the Linux Operating System.
If not, for relevant tutorials please visit our website which is as shown.
Shell script can accept arguments from the command line.
An argument is passed to a program being called.
Any number of arguments can be passed to a program.
Let us open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
I have already written the code in the file named arg.sh.
On the terminal, let me open this file by typing-
gedit space arg.sh space ampersand sign(&).
We use the ampersand to free up the prompt.
The text editor is opened.
This line will print the zeroth argument.
Here, $0 (Dollar zero) will print the name of the shell script.
This, in turn, means that the zeroth  argument is the name of the program itself.
Let us execute the program and see.
First, make the file executable by typing:
chmod space plus x space arg.sh
Now, type: dot slash arg.sh
Press Enter.The output is displayed as: Zeroth argument is arg.sh.
Now, come back to our editor and type the three lines as shown here.
$1 (Dollar one) represents the first argument passed to the program from the command line.
$2 (Dollar two) represents the second argument passed to the program
and $3 (Dollar three) represents the third argument.
Now, click on Save.Let us execute the program and see.
Press the up-arrow key,  press Enter.
We see that the zeroth argument is printed
but the first, second and third arguments are blank.
This is because the command line arguments are given during execution.
Hence, press the up-arrow key and type: sunday monday and tuesday
You can see that the first, second and third arguments are sunday monday and tuesday.
Now switch back to our editor. Press Enter.
Now, type the line as shown here.
$12 (Dollar twelve) represents the twelfth argument.
To write an argument greater than 9, we need to use curly brackets.
Else, bash will only take the argument of the integer in the ten's place
and you will not get expected output.
Now click on Save.
Now we need to give 12 or 13 arguments to the program.
Hence, type: dot slash arg.sh space 1 to 13. Now press Enter.
You can see that the 12th argument is 12.
Come back to our editor
and type the line as shown here.
$# (Dollar hash) gives the total number of arguments that have been passed to a program.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute.Switch to the terminal.
Let us execute. Press the up-arrow key and press Enter.
We can see that the total arguments are 13.
Now switch to the editor.
Press Enter and type the lines as shown here.
$* (Dollar asterisk) will print all the arguments on a single line.
We will test this with the help of a simple for loop.
We will analyze this for loop at the time of execution.
Now, click on Save. Switch to the terminal.
Now, let us type: dot slash arg.sh space sunday monday and tuesday.
You can see that the total number of arguments are 3 as we have passed 3 arguments to our program.
As already said, $* will print all the arguments on a single line.
And this is the output for the for loop.
We see that all the arguments are printed on the single line.
Now, move back to our program and type the lines as shown here.
$@ (Dollar at) will also print all the arguments.
However, this time each argument will be printed on separate line.
This is another for loop which will print each argument in a separate line.
Let us see how. Click on Save.
Press Enter. You can see the difference now.
These are the arguments printed by $@.
$@ prints each argument on separate line.
This is the output for the 2nd for loop.
Now let's move on to quoting in BASH.
Switch to the slides.
There are three types of quotes:
Double quote Single quote
Backslash.Double quote substitutes the value of variables and commands.
Example echo “Username is $USER”.
It displays the username  of the system.
Switch to the Terminal.
Now, type:  echo space within double quotes Username space  is dollar USER  in capitals.
Press Enter. The username of the system is printed.
The output will vary according to your system.
Now move back to slides.
Single quotes preserves the literal meaning of each character of a given string.
It is used to turn off special meaning of all characters.
Switch to the Terminal.
Type: echo space within single quote Username  is dollar USER in capital.
The output is Username is $USER.
In this example, it prints all the characters which appear within the single quotes.
It does not substitute the value of variable $USER.
Backslash removes the special meaning from a single character.
It is used as an escape character in BASH.
Switch to the Terminal.
Now, type: echo space within double quote Username is backslash dollar USER  (in capital).
Since we have given double quotes, we expect the echo command to display the username.
Let's try this command, so press Enter.
The output is Username is $USER.
In this example, the backslash removes the special meaning of (Dollar) '$' symbol.
$USER is just treated as a string without any special functionality.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt:
Command line arguments
Functionality of  double quote, single quote and backslash.
It summarizes the Spoken-Tutorial project.

Welcome to this tutorial on Introduction to ggplot2.
Need for data visualization
Basic plot function in R
ggplot2 package
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Basics of Statistics and
Data frames
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux  OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use,
A data frame moviesData.csv
And a script file ggPlots.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to ggPlots folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set ggPlots folder as my Working Directory.
Now let us learn about visualization.
Visualization is an important tool for insight generation.
It is used to understand the data structure, identify outliers and find patterns.
There are 2 methods of data visualization in R:
Basics graphics and
Grammar of graphics (popularly known as ggplot2)
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script ggPlots.R in RStudio.
Let us run this script by clicking on the Source button.
movies data frame is loaded in the workspace.
This data frame will be used later in this tutorial.
First, we will plot a sine curve by taking equally spaced samples.
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Here, we have used the seq function to generate a sequence.
This sequence is from minus pi to plus pi with an interval of zero point one.
In plot command, the first argument is x and the second argument y is Sine of x.
Save the script and run the last three lines of code by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
A plot of sine curve appears in the Plots window.
In the Plots window, click on the Zoom button to maximize the plot.
Now we will add some more layers in this plot.
Click on Close  button to close this plot.
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Here, we have added main and ylab arguments to the plot function.
Run the current line.
In the Plots window, click on Zoom button to maximize the plot.
The title of the plot and label of Y-axis have been added to the plot.
Close this plot.
Now we will learn how to change the type of plot.
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Here, we have used the type argument and set it to l.
It means that the type of plot we need is lines.
col equal to blue, changes the colour of the plot to blue.
Run the current line.
The type and color of the plot have been changed.
Now, we will plot one more graph on the same plot.
Let us plot cosine of x along with sine of x on the same plot.
In the Source window, type the following commands.
This command plots sine of x using the plot function.
Next, we use lines function to plot cosine of x.
After the first line is plotted, the lines function is used.
It takes an additional vector cos of x as an input to draw the second line in the plot.
Run the last two lines of code by pressing Ctrl+Enter keys simultaneously.
The two graphs appear in the same plot window.
Here we can add a legend to the plot to differentiate between the multiple graphs.
For this, we will use legend function.
In the Source window, type the following command.
I will resize the Source window.
The first argument refers to the coordinates for placing the legend in our plot.
We have set the coordinates to topleft.
The second argument is the names to be given.
Since we have plotted sine and cosine functions, we will pass these two names as a vector.
Next, we have used the fill argument to specify the graphs by their colors.
Recall that, sine function is plotted in blue and cosine function in red.
I will resize the Plots window.
Run the last three lines of code by pressing Ctrl+Enter keys simultaneously.
In the Plots window, click on Zoom button to maximize the plot.
The two plots with their names appear in the same graph.
Close the plot.
So far, we have discussed the basic graphics in R language.
Now, we will learn about the grammar of graphics by using ggplot2 package.
ggplot2 package was created by Hadley Wickham in 2005.
It offers a powerful graphics language for creating elegant and complex plots.
Let us switch to RStudio.
I will resize the Plots window.
To use any package in R, we need to install and then load it.
As I have already installed ggplot2 package, I will load this directly.
If you have not installed the package, please use install dot packages function.
Please make sure that you are connected to the Internet while installing the packages.
To load this package, we will add the library at the top of the script.
In the Source window, scroll up to the top of the script.
Now, at the top of the script, type library and ggplot2 in parentheses.
Save the script and run this line.
Now, in the Source window, click on the next line after the legend function.
We will use movies data frame for exploring ggplot2 package.
Let us view the objects available in movies data frame.
In the Source window, type View and movies in parentheses.
Run the current line.
movies data frame opens in the Source window.
Now, we will create a simple scatter plot with two different objects of movies.
Remember, a scatter plot is a graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along the axes.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right to see the remaining objects of movies data frame.
Suppose, we want to visualize the correlation between critics_score and audience_score.
In the Source window, click on the script ggPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
ggplot function takes three basic arguments:
Data Aesthetics Geometry
In ggplot function, we have used the following arguments:
data, which refers to the data set to be used for plotting.
We have set data equal to movies.
mapping, which is used to apply aesthetics mapping to the plot.
aes, which is used to specify the mapping of objects on X and Y axes.
We will learn more about aesthetics mapping later in this series.
geom underscore point is used to draw points defined by X and Y coordinates.
Run the current line.
Scatter plot appears in the Plots window.
In the Plots window, click on the Zoom button to maximize the plot.
We can see that there is a positive correlation between critics_score and audience_score.
Now we will learn how to save a plot generated by ggplot function.
Close this plot.
For saving the plots, there is a function named ggsave in ggplot2 package.
To know the syntax of ggsave function, we will access the Help section in RStudio.
In the Console window, type question mark ggsave and press Enter.
I will resize the Help window.
The first argument in this function is the filename.
Next, there is the argument named plot which means the plot to be saved.
By default, it will save the last plot.
Click on the Plots window.
Let us save our scatter plot with a name scatter underscore plot in png format.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
Click on the Files tab.
The plot has been saved in our current working directory.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about,
Need for data visualization
Basic plot function in R
ggplot2 package
We now suggest an assignment.
Consider the built-in data set mtcars. Find the numerical variables in this data set.
Make a scatter plot from the objects named mpg and wt in this data set.
Save the plot in .jpeg format.

Welcome to this tutorial on Coordinate Reference System in  QGIS.
In this tutorial, we will learn to,
Add layers to projections in QGIS.
View metadata information for layers.
Save selected features from a layer to a new layer.
Re-project and overlay data layers of different projections together.
To record this tutorial I am using,
To follow this tutorial you should have basic knowledge about GIS.
Please view previous tutorial in this series.
About Coordinate Reference Systems,
Coordinate Reference Systems are of two types,
Most widely used geographic coordinate system is WGS 84.
Most widely used projected coordinate system is UTM.
Here I have opened QGIS interface.
On the canvas, world map with country administration boundaries is displayed.
Demonstration on how to download the map and display in QGIS is explained in the prerequisite tutorial.
Please view the pre-requisite tutorial.
This file can also be downloaded from the Code files link.
On the left-side of the canvas, you will see Layers Panel, with file name of the world map as a layer.
By default Layers Panel is enabled here.
If not, we can enable or disable the Layers Panel using View menu.
Click on View menu on the menu bar.
Sub-menu shows a list of panel names.
Click on Layer Panel option to enable or disable the panel.
We can adjust the size of the panel by dragging the boundary.
If you wish to change the color of the map, right-click on the layer name in the Layers Panel.
Scroll-down the context menu and select Styles option.
Sub-menu shows a color triangle .
Choose the color by rotating the vertex of the color triangle.
Click anywhere on the canvas to close the context menu.
At the bottom-left corner, on the status bar of QGIS window, you will notice the label Coordinate  and a text box with numbers.
Values of X  and Y coordinates for a particular location are shown in this text box.
Move the cursor over the map.
Observe, that the values of X and Y coordinates change with location of the cursor.
By default Render option is checked on the status bar.
On the status bar, at the bottom-right corner, you will see another label, Current CRS
This code represents the current Projection Coordinate Reference System.
To determine a layer’s projection, we can look into the metadata.
On the Layers Panel, right-click on the layer name.
From the context menu, select Properties.
In the dialog-box, on the left-side panel, click on Metadata option.
Under Properties section, scroll down the slider.
At the bottom, under heading, Layer Spatial Reference System, you will see the definition for this projection.
It shows WGS84 as geographic coordinate system.
Click on Ok button at the bottom, to close the dialog box.
Let us now add layers to the map and change the projection.
About data layers.
Usually geographical data is stored in layers in a GIS workspace.
Each layer has data stored in its attribute table.
Many layers can represent data of the same geographical location.
Back to the QGIS interface.
Now let us see how we can change the layer’s projection.
This operation is called Re-Projection.
Instead of re-projecting the entire layer, we will re-project some features.
On top-right corner of the tool bar, click on Select features by area or single click tool.
Click on the black triangle next to this tool.
From the drop down choose Select features.
On the world map displayed on canvas, click on the United States of America feature to select it.
Note that, the United States of America is shown in a different color.
We will now change the projected coordinate system of this layer and save.
Right-click on the layer name in the Layers Panel.
Scroll down, select Save As option.
Save Vector Layer as... dialog box opens.
The default format option is ESRI Shapefile.
Click on Browse button next to File name text box.
Save layer as... dialog-box opens.
Find a suitable location to save.
Click on Save button at the bottom.
In the Save Vector Layer as.... dialog-box, the file path appears in the File name text box.
We will choose the new projection for this layer.
Next to the CRS drop down box, click on Select CRS button.
In the Coordinate Reference System Selector, in the Filter search box, enter North America
Under Coordinate reference systems of the world, under heading Projected Coordinate System,  scroll through the results.
Select, North_America_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic (EPSG:102008) projection.
Click on OK button at the bottom.
In the CRS drop down box, the newly selected CRS is shown.
Click on the check box to check Save only selected features option.
This will ensure that only the selected feature gets re-projected and exported.
Here, by default, Add saved file to map option is checked.
If not, click on the check box to check this option.
The re-projected layer gets loaded, in a different color.
These two layers are now in different projections.
Observe that, on Layers Panel, you can now see 2 entries.
Notice that the new United States layer overlays perfectly on top of the world map layer.
This is because QGIS has a feature called On-the-fly CRS transformation.
The projection text at the bottom-right corner of QGIS window has the words, OTF next to EPSG:4326.
Select the United-States layer in the Layers Panel by clicking on it.
Click on the Current CRS text, EPSG:4326, at the bottom-right corner of the status bar.
Project Properties CRS dialog-box opens.
Let us turn-off the Enable on-the-fly CRS transformation and see what happens.
Uncheck the Enable on the fly CRS transformation check box, by clicking on it.
Back in the main QGIS window, you will see the world map disappear.
You can see only the United States map on the canvas.
This is because the Projected CRS for this layer changed to Albers Projection.
The coordinates and scale are different now.
Right-click the United States layer in the Layers Panel.
Select Zoom to Layer option.
Now you will see the United States in the selected projection.
Again, click on the Current CRS text to open Project Properties dialog-box.
Turn-on the Enable ‘on the fly’ CRS transformation option.
Under the heading Recently used Coordinate Reference Systems, select WGS 84.
The display on the canvas will return to its previous state with world map.
To delete the vector layer from the dataset, right-click on the name in the Layers panel.
From the context menu, click on Remove option.
A prompt appears to confirm the action.
Observe that the layer is removed from the dataset.
Let us summarize,
In this tutorial we have learnt to
View metadata information for layers.
Save selected features from a layer to a new layer.
Re-project and overlay data layers of different projections together.
As an Assignment:
Re-project the entire world map layer into World Mercator projection system.

Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on More on redirection.
appending redirected output
with the help of some examples.
For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System
In an earlier tutorial, we learned about standard output and standard errors.
Both, stderr and stdout, can be redirected to the same file.
This can be done in multiple ways.
We will cover two of the most important methods of redirection in this tutorial.
The first method to redirect both the standard output and  error is by using  &>(ampersand) followed by greater-than sign.
The syntax is command space ampersand greater than space filename.
Let me open a file named redirect.sh.
ls lists the directory content of 2 directories namely /usr and /user.
Note that /user directory does not exist.
Hence the command ls will throw an error.
'&'(ampersand) followed by 'greater than' will redirect stdout  and stderr to out_(underscore)file.txt.
Now save the file.
Let us run the file redirect.sh.
Open the terminal using CTRL + ALT and  T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Type: chmod space plus x space redirect dot sh
Type: dot slash redirect dot sh
We can see the output by opening out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt.
Type: cat space out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt.
We can see both, the error and output.
The error for directory /user is recorded in this file.
It says that there was no '/user' directory found.
The directory content for /usr is displayed.
Please note that the content for  '/usr' directory may vary on your system.
Now, let us delete this file. So, on the terminal,  type: rm space out_(underscore)file. (dot)txt.
Another method is to use 2 greater than ampersand 1 after the filename.
The syntax is command space greater than filename space 2 greater than ampersand 1.
We can also redirect to slash dev slash null (/dev/null) file.
Let us learn a little more about slash dev slash null (/dev/null) file.
It is a special kind of file.
It is a null file or a place where we can dump anything.
It includes the output and error messages.
It is also called as bit bucket.
Let us now come back to our code in gedit.
Let us redirect both standard output and error to the null file.
I will copy this line of code and paste it below over here.
I want both the output and error messages to be discarded.
So, I will change this part of the copied code. > (greater than) means truncate or write.
slash dev slash null is the null file. 2>&1 (2 greater than ampersand 1)
Number “2” will redirect standard error to standard output, denoted by number “1”.
Now, click on Save. Save the code.
Let us run the file redirect.sh.
Recall the previous command with the up-arrow key. dot slash redirect.sh and press Enter.
We can see the output by typing cat out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt.
Come back to the slides.
We can capture as well as append standard output or error to a file.
The output or the error will be appended at the end of the file.
If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.
The syntax is command space greater than greater than space followed by filename .
Let us understand this using an example.
Let me open the file redirect.(dot)sh.
Now, here let's type: date space greater than greater than space out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt.
The 'date' command will simply display the system date as output.
We can check this command on the terminal by typing 'date.'
Come back to the terminal. Type date. You can see that the system date i.e. the current date is displayed.
The output of date command will be appended to the out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt file.
We are using this file to capture standard output and error of 'ls' command.
Click on SaveSwitch to the terminal.
Now press the up-arrow key. Recall the previous command  dot slash redirect dot sh.
Let us check the output by opening out_(underscore) file.(dot)txt.
Type: cat space out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt
Observe that the output of 'date'  command is appended to the end of the file.
In this tutorial, we learnt:
Redirection of both standard error and output;
Create X_(underscore)file.(dot)txt file with some contents.
Redirect the contents of both out_(underscore)file.(dot)txt and X_(underscore)file.(dot)txt to a new file.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on generating mesh using snappyHexMesh in OpenFOAM.
As a pre-requisite, you should know parameters in snappyHexMeshDict to generate mesh.
We are solving an existing case of flange fromlaplacianFoam in basic directory.
Now, let us go to home folder and click on OpenFoam-2.2.2 folder.
You will see tutorials. Click on it.
Then click on mesh folder.
You will see the snappyHexMesh folder. Click on it.
In this folder, create a new folder by name flange_1.
Now, let's go back two levels.
Open the basic folder. You will see laplacianFoam folder. Click on it.
You will see flange case. Click on it to open the folder.
Copy the three folders 0, constant and system.
Now, let us go three levels back. Paste the copied folders inside the flange_1 folder.
Now, let us go one level back.  Click on flange folder. You will see constant and system folders.
Click on system folder.
Copy snappyHexMeshDict and surfaceFeatureExtractDict from this folder. Now, let us go two levels back.
Paste these two files inside the system directory of flange_1 folder.
Now, let us go one level back. Click on constant folder. In this, create a folder by name triSurface.
Now, let us go four levels back.
Open the resources folder.
You will see geometry folder. Now, open the geometry folder.
In this, you will see flange.stl.gz file. Extract this file.
Give the path of triSurface folder in constant directory of flange_1 folder. Now close this.
Open command terminal and enter the path for flange_1 as shown. Type: cd space OpenFOAM-2.2.2/tutorials/mesh/snappyHexMesh/flange_1 and press Enter.
There are three folders 0, constant and system. Type cd space constant and press Enter.
Now type "ls" and press Enter. You will see the polymesh and triSurface folders.Type: cd space polymesh and press Enter.
Now type: "ls" and press Enter. You can see the blockMeshDict file.
To view the contents of the file, type:  gedit space blockMeshDict and press Enter.
This will open up the blockMeshDict file. This file contains co-ordinates for hex mesh and boundary patches.
Now close this and in the command terminal, type: cd (space) .. (dot) (dot) and press Enter. Again type: cd (space) .. (dot) (dot) and press Enter.
Now, type: cd space system and press Enter.
Now type: "ls" and press Enter. You can see the surfaceFeatureExtractDict file.

This file contains the information about geometry’s feature edges. The included angle is taken as 150.
Now close this. In command terminal, type: gedit space snappyHexMeshDict and press Enter(Note that H, M and D here are capital).
This will open up the snappyHexMeshDict file. This file contains all the instructions about snappyHexMesh.
In snappyHexMeshDict, I have already made some changes. I have named flange.stl same as that of STL file which is in the constant/trisurface directory.
For Explicit feature edge refinement in castellatedMeshControls, I have given the file name flange.eMesh. This file is obtained by surfaceFeatureExtract utility.
The remaining details in the snappyHexMesh have changed as per requirements.
Now close this and in command terminal, type cd (space) .. (dot) (dot) and press Enter.
Type: cd space 0 (zero) and press Enter.
Type "ls" and press Enter. You can see the 'T' file.
Now type: gedit space T and press Enter.
This will open up the 'T' file. You will see the initial conditions for every patch.
Now, we have to give initial conditions for all patches of flange.
Copy the initial conditions for patch 1 and paste it after patch 4, in the same file 'T.' Now type "flange_" before this patch 1.
Similarly, we can do this for patch 2, 3 and 4. Save this 'T' file and close it.
And, in the command terminal type: cd (space) .. (dot) (dot)and press Enter.
Now, we need to mesh the geometry. For that, in command terminal, type: blockMesh and press Enter. Meshing is done.
Now type: surfaceFeatureExtract and press Enter (Note that F and E here are capital).Surface feature extraction is done.
Now, type: snappyHexMesh -(dash) overwrite and press Enter. - (dash) overwrite command will prevent copying the files from the last time folders.
If not, the resulting meshes will be inside the next time folders, possibly the folders 1, 2 and 3.
Meshing will take some time. Now meshing is completed.
For simulating temperature distribution, we are using 'laplacianFoam' solver.
In the command terminal, type: laplacianFoam and press Enter (Note that F here is capital).
Iterations running will be seen in the terminal window.
Once solving is completed, type: paraFoam and press Enter to view the geometry and the results. This will open up the Paraview window.
On the left hand side of Paraview window, click on Apply. The geometry can be seen here.
Scroll down the properties panel of the Object Inspector menu. Check the box for T in the Volume Fields and click on Apply.
Now go to the top of Active variable control drop-down menu. Change from solid color to capital 'T', which is the initial condition for the flange.
Now on the top of the Paraview window, you can see the VCR controls. Click on the Play button. Now, this is the final result for temperature distribution of a flange.
Toggle on the color legend by clicking on top left of the Active variable control menu.This is the colour legend for temperature T.
Now, let me get back to the slides.

Conditional Operators-
You can also use the If and Or condition on data
to print the results according to the condition that holds TRUE.
The result again automatically changes to “Negative”.
Notice the result shows 7,50,000.
We shall change:6000 to 6000.34,
The best solution is to round off the result to the nearest whole number.
Rounding off, can also be done to either the lower whole number or the higher number.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Interference and Diffraction.
At the end of this tutorial you will be able to,
Verify the relation between wavelength and relative intensity.
Find the relation between slit width, maxima and minima.
Calculate the angle for the given maxima.
Interpret diffraction intensity profile.
Verify the relation between wavelength and angle.
Here I am using,
To follow this tutorial,
For Pre-requisites tutorials please visit this site.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
Right click on doubleslit_en.htm file.
Select the Open With Firefox web Browser option.
The App shows Young’s double slit experiment for the interference pattern.
The setup includes a slit and a semicircular screen.
On the green panel we can change the wavelength of the source light.
Here the range of the wavelength is from 380 nanometer to 780 nanometer.
We can also enter the value of wavelength in the text-box.
Let us see how change in wavelength changes the interference pattern.
Drag the Wavelength slider to 380 nanometer
Click on Intensity profile radio button at the bottom of the green panel.
Drag the Wavelength slider slowly towards higher wavelength.
Observe the graph showing dark and bright fringes in the intensity profile.
As the wavelength increases, distance between dark and bright fringes increases.
Next Drag the Angle slider here we can change the angle from 0 degrees to 90 degrees.
Note that as we change the angle, white arrows shifts their position.
This shift is also shown in the graph.
Scroll down the screen.
Here the conditions for maxima and minima are given.
For more details please read the additional material provided in this tutorial.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to reset the App.
Scroll up and increase the spacing between the slit to 2000 nanometer.
Now click on the Maxima drop down.
Click on the Minima drop down.
Note that the first minima is formed at 8.6 degrees.
Click on the second minima that is k=2.
The white arrows shift to the second minima in both screen and graph.
Here the Relative intensity changes to zero(0).
Zero indicates dark fringe.
The waves superimpose and are out of phase to give zero intensity.
Click on the Intensity profile radio button.
Here note that the red points indicate zero intensity.
Now click on Maxima drop down and select k=3.
The red point has shifted to the third peak.
The Relative intensity has changed to 1.
Here the waves superimpose to form a wave with maximum intensity.
This is constructive interference.
Click on Interference pattern radio button at the bottom of the green panel.
Note that the interference graph shows equally spaced dark and bright fringes.
Therefore the value of relative intensity only shows 0 and 1.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to reset the App.
Let us calculate the value of angle for first maxima.
To do so we can rearrange the equation given in the interface
Take the value of k as 1 since we have to calculate the angle for the first maxima.
Take the value of wavelength and spacing between slit as shown on interface.
Next substitute the values in the formula.
The calculated value of angle of first maxima is 36.86 degree.
Let us compare with the value shown in the App.
Click on the Maxima drop down and select k=1.
Observe that the value of the angle next to K=1 is 36.9 degrees.
The value is comparable with the calculated value.
As an Assignment
Let us move on to the next App.
Follow the same steps as shown earlier while opening the App.
The Diffraction of Light by a Single Slit opens on the screen.
This App shows the setup of diffraction through a single slit experiment.
This set up is also known as Fraunhofer's Diffraction at a single slit.
scroll down to see the conditions for maxima and minima.
Scroll up and select Intensity profile radio button.
Observe that, only one central bright region is seen.
This intensity decreases as we move away from the center.
In the green panel, click on the Width of slit text-box and enter 3000 nanometer.
Observe that a number of alternate dark and bright fringes are formed
Now click on the Maxima drop down.
Observe that the central maxima is at 0 degrees.
It shows Relative intensity as 1. This is the maximum intensity.
From the Maxima drop down select k=1.
Here the Relative intensity decreases from 1 to 0.0472.
Again click on Maxima drop down and select k=2.
The Relative intensity decreases to 0.0165.
Know Click on the Minima drop down and select k =2
The value of Relative intensity is shown as 0.
Click on Minima drop down and select k=4.
Note that for every dark fringe the value of relative intensity will remain zero.
Here I have made the table to show the relative intensity for maxima and minima.
Observe the relative intensity for maxima.
The Relative intensity decreases as we move away from central region.
For  each minima, we have seen that the value remains zero for the relative intensity.
Drag the Wavelength slider to its highest value that is to 780 nm.
Next click on Maxima drop down.
Next drag the slider of Wavelength to its lowest value that is to 380 nanometer.
Now click on the Maxima drop down.
Here we can see eight positions for bright fringes.
This happens because violet light refracts more than red light.
Hence we see more number of bright fringes for violet light.
Drag the Wavelength slider to 520 nm.
Click on Maxima drop down and select first bright fringe.
Here the first bright fringe is formed at an angle of 14.4 degrees.
Again drag the slider of Wavelength to 720 nanometer.
Click on the Maxima drop down and select K=1.
Here the first bright fringe is formed at an angle of 20.1 degrees.
Hence we conclude that if we increase the wavelength, angle also increases.
Scroll down the screen.
Here, the angle is directly proportional to the wavelength.
Use the table as shown earlier in this tutorial for your reference.
Tabulate the total number of maxima and minima.
For each maxima tabulate the value of relative intensity from the App.
Differentiate between interference and diffraction patterns.
In this tutorial we have, Verified the relation between wavelength and relative intensity.
Found the relation between slit width, maxima and minima.
Calculated the angle for the given maxima.
Interpreted diffraction intensity profile.
Verified the relation between wavelength and angle.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Tables in HTML
In this tutorial we will learn:
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or text editor and web browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML5
However you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
Tables are used to format the content to be displayed on the web, in the form of Rows and Columns
Look at this example of writing code in HTML to create a table.
Do you notice the different tags used here?
Note the positions of the table start and end tags.
The content to be formatted as a table, should be written within these tags.
Look at the caption tag.
Observe that the caption has to be declared immediately after the table start tag.
The content of the table is formatted into rows.
Observe that we have used the tr tag to create a new row in the table.
tr stands for table row.
Here, we have used the th tag to declare the column headings.
th stands for table heading.
th is also not a mandatory tag.
We can use the th tag instead of the td tag in the first row, when we want column headings.
Look at the td tags here. They are used to declare the value within each cell of the table.
td stands for table definition.
This code will create a table with 2 rows and 2 columns.
Let us open our file MyFirstPage.html.
I have already opened the html file in my editor and here is our code.
This file is also available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page.
Here, we will see how to format the content with the help of table.
Pause the tutorial here for a while and do the following.
Below the definition list, type the sample table code, as shown here.
Switch to the folder where we have saved the code.
Right-click on it and open with any web browser.
Here is the caption.
These are the headings.
The individual rows and their values.
Though the content is displayed in rows and columns, it not appearing as a table.
We can make it look better with the help of the following attributes and styles:
Border,  Width,  Spacing and Padding , Rowspan and Columnspan
The Rowspan and Columnspan are declared inside the td and th tag.
The others are declared inside the table start tag or in a style tag or attribute.
Let us look at them one by one with the help of examples.
Open our file mystyle.css in text editor
Type the code as shown here
Here 1 pixel denotes the border thickness
And Solid Blue denotes the color of the border.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
We can see that the table now has an outer border.
To put a border for the rows and columns, we have to specify the border style for the td and th tags.
In mystyle.css file, next to table add
This will set the border for each of the rows and columns in the table.
Let us also set the width of the table using the width attribute.
So next to the border attribute, type this code.
This will set the width of the table to 200 pixels.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
The width of the table is adjusted as per the value we gave, which is 200 pixels.
Note that this makes the content wrap to the next line.
Next, we will look at the other two table attributes which are spacing and padding.
The space between the cells is defined with the help of Border Spacing
The space between the cell content and the cell border is defined with the help of Padding
Let us switch to the editor window.
In the mystyle.css file, next to width
This will set the space between the borders as 5 pixels.
Then let us add the padding space for the cell contents and the borders.
After the border spacing, type the following.
This will set the padding space as 5 pixels.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
What if we want to merge two cells of a row?
Let’s say I want only one heading over here.
And instead of two rows for the 1st column, I need only one.
This can be done with the help of rowspan and columnspan attributes.
Switch to the editor window.
In the table section remove the line for Heading 2
I want the Heading 1 to be spanned across the two cells, columnwise.
So inside the Heading 1’s th tag, type
Next I want the Row 1 Value 1 to be spanned for 2 cells row wise.
So inside the Row 1 Value 1’s td tag, type rowspan equal to within single quotes 2
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to create Tables in HTML.
We have also learnt to set the Table Attributes such as

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Calling user-defined functions in Xcos.
In this tutorial we will learn:
* To write a squaring function in Scilab
* To use the scifunc block in  Xcos
* To use MUX block to draw multiple plots
* To call functions having multiple inputs and outputs.
Ubuntu 12.04 is the operating system used with Scilab version 5.3.3 installed.
You should have basic knowledge of Scilab,
basic knowledge of  Xcos.
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit spoken hyphen tutorial dot org.
In the Scilab console, type  editor and press Enter.
Then type the following code:
function space y is equal to squareit open bracket a close bracket.
Press the Enter key and type:
y is equal to a raise to 2
put a semicolon in the end.
The function has one input variable  a  and one output variable y.
The name of the function is squareit.
This function will do the job of squaring the variable a.
It will store the result in y.
Let us save this file in the desired directory.
I will save this file with file name  squareit and extension .sci.
Here we are following the convention of saving functions in .sci format.
Switch to the Scilab console.
Now, type Xcos and press Enter.
Two windows will open,
a Palette browser and an Untitled Xcos window.
Now we will make the Xcos diagram.
This will access the function squareit created just now.
This can be done by using scifunc block.
Switch to the Palette browser window.
Click on the  User-Defined function in the pallet browser.
Locate the block scifunc_block_m in this section.
Drag and drop it in untitled Xcos window.
I will zoom the untitled Xcos window for better view.
I will use the Zoom button as you see.
Now double click on the scifunc block to configure it.
A window named  Scilab Multiple Values Request will open.
This window will allow you to change the number of input and output ports of the scifunc block.
Our function squareit has only one input and output variable.
Hence, we will keep the settings unchanged.
Click on OK.
A new Scilab Input Value Request window will open.
In the text box, type the function name along with input and output variables.
This function will be called by the scifunc block.
In the text box available,
edit the default function name.
Type y1 equal to squareit open bracket u1 close the bracket.
Note that here the input and output variables are u1 and y1 respectively.
These should be strictly in u and y form and not as per the variable names used in the actual function.
Cick on OK.
Another Scilab Input Value Request window will open.
Keep clicking on OK in the subsequent 3 windows that will appear.
The scifunc block is now configured.
Next we will include a sinusoid generator block.
In the Palette browser window, click on Sources section.
Drag and drop the Sinusoid generator block in Untitled Xcos window.
Place the block towards the left of the scifunc block, for convenience.
Now we need a block to plot the output variable.
In the Palette browser window, click on the Sinks section.
Drag and drop the CScope block in the Untitled Xcos window.
Place the block towards the right of the scifunc block.
Place it away from scifunc block, for convenience.
Notice that the CScope block has a red input port.
This is an event input.
we need an event generator block.
In the  Palette browser window, click on Sources section.
Drag and drop the CLOCK underscore c block in the Untitled Xcos window.
Place it above the CScope block.
Notice that the CScope block has only one input port.
But we want to plot both the input and output variables in a single plot window.
Hence, we need a multiplexer block.
This block will multiplex two inputs and generate output on one output port.
In the Palette browser window, click on Signal Routing section.
Drag and drop the MUX block in the Untitled Xcos window.
Place the block between the scifunc block and CScope block.
Let me resize and realign the Mux block.
Now, let us connect the blocks together.
Connect the output port of Sinusoid generator block to the input port of scifunc block.
Now connect the output port of scifunc block to the lower input port of the MUX.
Connect the output port of MUX block to the input port of CScope  block.
Connect the output port of CLOCK underscore c block to the event input port of CScope block.
We also have to plot the sine input.
We have to connect the Sinusoid generator block to the MUX.
Click on the upper input port of the MUX block.
Then without releasing, move your mouse pointer towards the link between the  Sinusoid generator block and scifunc block.
To bend the link, release the mouse button or click at places.
As you bring the pointer on the link, the link turns green.
Release the mouse button or click once to create a link between these two blocks.
Now let us see the configuration of other blocks.
We can change the frequency, magnitude and phase of the sinusoid generator block.
To do this, double click on the Sinusoid generator block.
The configuration window will open.
We will keep the Magnitude and Frequency as 1 and Phase as 0.
Click on OK to close the configuration window.
Now let us configure the CScope block.
Double click on the CScope block to open its configuration window.
Change the Ymin parameter to minus 2 and Ymax parameter to 2.
Change the Refresh period value to 10.
Make a mental note of this value.
Change the Buffer size value to 2 .
click on OK.
Now let us configure the CLOCK_c  block.
Double click on the block to open its configuration window.
Keep the value of Period as 0.1.
Change the Initialisation Time to be 0.
Click on OK.
Now let us change the Simulation parameters.
On the menu bar of the Untitled Xcos window click on the Simulation tab.
Now click on Setup from the drop down menu.
Change the Final Integration time to match the Refresh period of CScope block.
The value of Refresh period was 10.
Hence, put the value of Final integration time as 10.
Click on OK.
Now, click on File and then click on Save to save the Xcos diagram.
Choose a desired directory to save the Xcos diagram.
However, it is advised to save it in the folder where you have saved the squareit.sci file.
Click on OK.
Note that the scifunc block will call the  squareit function.
This means that we should first load the  squareit function before we execute the Xcos diagram.
Switch to the  Scilab editor window, which has the squareit.sci file open.
Click on the Execute button available on the menu bar of the editor.
This will load the squareit function.
Now we can execute the Xcos diagram.
Open the Xcos diagram file.
Click on the Start button available on the menu bar of Xcos window.
A graphic window will appear.
This window will have two plots.
Input sine wave in black color and output sine wave in green color.
Notice that the squaring function implemented in the squareit function, has indeed squared the input sine wave.
Hence, the output sine wave has been shifted to the positive axis.
Close the plot window.
Now, let us see how to edit the scifunc block to call a function which has more than one input and output variables.
Switch to scilab editor window.
Edit the squareit function to have two input and output variables.
Edit the output variable as open square bracket y comma z close the square bracket .
Edit the input variables as open bracket a comma b close bracket.
We will change the function to shift the squared output by 1 unit.
Edit the main function line as:
y is equal to b plus a raise to two put a semicolon in the end.
Also generate an output whose amplitude will be half of the input.
Go to next line by pressing Enter key and type:
z is equal to 0.5 multiplied by a put a semicolon in the end.
Now save the file.
Switch to the Xcos window.
Double click on the scifunc block to configure it.
In the input port size field, put a semi colon after 1 comma 1 and type 1 comma one again.
Similarly, in the output port size field, put a semi colon after 1 comma 1 and type 1 comma 1 again.
Click on OK.
A new Scilab Input Value Request window will open.
In the text box,
put a comma after y1 and type y2,
put y1 and y2 in square brackets,
now put a comma after u1 and type u2.
Click on OK.
Another Scilab Input Value Request window will open.
Keep  clicking on OK in the subsequent 3 windows that will appear.
The scifunc block is now  configured.
Let me realign the scifunc block.
Switch to the  Palette browser window.
In the Sources section, drag and drop the Constant underscore m block in the Xcos window.
Place it below the Sinusoid generator block.
Connect the Constant underscore m block to the lower input of the scifunc block.
The default value of this block is 1.
Keep it unchanged.
Double click on the MUX block.
Change the input port size to 3.
Click on OK.
Let me resize the MUX block and I will connect MUX and CSCOPE block properly.
Connect the lower output port of the scifunc block to the lower input port of MUX block.
Click on File and choose Save to save the xcos file.
Switch to the Scilab editor which has the squareit.sci file open.
Click on the Execute button available on the menu bar of the editor.
This will load the squareit function.
Now we can execute the Xcos diagram.
Click on the Start button available on the menu bar of the Xcos window.
A graphic window will appear.
This window will have three plots.
Input sine wave in black color,
output   sine wave in green color and
amplitude scaled input in red colour.
Notice that the function has indeed squared the input sine wave and also shifted it by an offset of 1 unit, which is as expected.
We also get the amplitude scaled of the input sine wave, as expected.
Close the plot window.
Now let us summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt:
* To write a squaring function in Scilab
* To use the scifunc block in Xcos
* To use MUX  block to draw multiple plots
* To call functions having multiple input and output.

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
For today’s tutorial I promised you with a question and answer edition, so let’s start with some news.
I have already informed you about 'gimpusers.com' and they have a great news about a video podcast of the GIMP but I think you know that podcast already.
So, let’s go to the download page and here you see that GIMP 2.4.0 release candidate and is available for Windows and I think for Apple Macintosh and in source for most linux systems except for mine
because Ubuntu is not able to cope with some libraries that are needed.
So, GIMP 2.4.0 is on the way and when you are on gimpusers.com, look at this area on the screen.
It’s a mirror of two mailing lists that gives lot of information about the GIMP.
First, the "gimp user" mailing list and I recommend you to read that.
The "gimp developer" list is above my head and perhaps above yours too.
And here is a discussion which answers a question and I didn’t know about that.
Let’s see it here.
The 1st question here is asked by Alex Burs and he asks: what the sample point tab did?
And I didn’t understand the question.
But I knew Alex because he tried to help me with providing the files for you and set up google site for me.
The answer here is from Tim Jedlicka & I know TIM too because Tim has big server in the internet and a big pipe through the internet. And we are just now in the process of setting up possibility for you to download the files that I use here.
I’ll keep you informing about it & just look into the block at meetthegimp.org and look if you find a download icon there.
Here Tim answers the question of Alex.
And I thank both of you for this question and answer conversation here.
Tim writes that sample points are created similar to guide except you have to hold down the Ctrl key & you can create a sample point by placing the cursor in the measurement bar and holding down Ctrl key while you drag the point you want to sample.
And there are some further questions but I will go through them later.
I never had heard about that and I have to try it.
To do that, I started the GIMP and load the image into it which is prepared to know as My Ship in the Fog.
Now, I shall go to the ruler on the left side, press the Ctrl key and pull the ruler out and you can see here that the mouse cursor changes to an eye dropper and I get two lines instead of one.
Just leave the mouse button and Ctrl key and you get a point with number one (1) on it.
And when I pull out the ruler with the mouse button pressed and without pressing the Ctrl key, I get only one line here which is used for adjusting things on it.
Let’s try to do the same procedure from the ruler on the top.
I press the Ctrl key and mouse button and pull down the ruler and release it here.
So, here I have number two (2) and number one (1) is already there but I can see no dialog here.
So, click on the tool options and select the Color Picker from the toolbox but I don’t see anything here.
But remember, there was a dialog mentioned in the files; so I click on File, go to Dialogs and here is a dialog called Sample Points.
When you click on it, you have got here sample points for 1 and 2.
And this is one method of getting color information about different points in the image.
And now I know a better way for getting the color information.
I can change here pixel to RGB and I get the values for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha is displayed in terms of percentage.
Here, with pixel you see the actual numerical value of colors and when RGB is selected, you see here the Hex code for HTML and I can change RGB in HSV color model or in CMYK color model and I will cover that later .
The next question is also related to color and the color picker.
I had mentioned in my podcast of ‘Ship in the Fog’ that you can take the color picker and get color information of the image and Glulio asks here how to get the color information of resulting color and not the color of one layer.
One way of that you just saw but there is a different way also.
I have the Color Picker selected and when I press Shift and click into the image, I get the current color information. And you see here the ship, the trees are white and also the sky which is not very satisfactory result.
And it’s because I have selected  white background.
So, I go to Layers dialog and change it to the original Background layer in dialog and you see it's fully different color from what you see on the screen.
There is an option in Layers dialog called Sample merged and when you activate that, you get the result of all stacked layers and with the Sample merged you see in the Color Picker Information, the foreground color  keeps on changing  all the time.
With Sample merged activated, you get results of all layers.
When you de-activate the Sample merged option, you get only the color information from the active layer and I forgot to tell that in previous show and when you select the blue layer you get information of blue color.
So go back, select Sample merged and you get result of all layers.
There is another option here called Sample average and when you select it you get a large Color Picker and get an average of all the pixels in that area.
It’s good option for getting color information for noisy image where you have big difference between the single pixels.
Glulio has another tip for the GIMP.
If you use not only .xcf as a file name but xcf.pz2 or xcf.bz2, the GIMP compresses the image and you get a smaller file size.
I don’t know if this works also on Windows machine and you have to try that.
Perhaps on Windows it would work if you name the file 'xcf.zip' but I don’t know if it is true.
Perhaps somebody should try it and post on the blog.
Another question comes from Dmitry.
He asks if I can increase the quality of the video by trying different codec.
But I didn’t find this codec H 264 for linux in a free version.
There is a commercial version but it’s too expensive for me.
This is just a hobby and I pay for uploading the stuff and it’s not much but I don’t want to spend money on this here.
But, I have a quality question for you.
I am recording this in 800/600 pixels and scale it down to 640/480 pixels just because everyone does it and this way it works on Apple TV and so on.
My question to you is: Do you prefer the original file size 800/600?
The image is clearer and you could see it better.
The files get a bit larger and there are people out there who can’t really see this bigger files.
I will make a test file in 800/600 and upload it. Perhaps you can try it and give me some feedback.
I am very happy about the next comment here, from Rodrigo, who says that he is thinking not to buy photoshop but to take the GIMP for his graphic work.
I got a question from Vitaly via email which says: Is there any way to use the Curve tool in a non destructive way??
Answer to this question is "NO, not in GIMP".
Photoshop can do that with this adjustment layer and there are lot of GIMP programmers who are working on that and trying to implement it.
But, up to now if you change your colors with Levels tool, it is in a way that you can’t undo your work without undoing all the steps you did after that.
Another question is from Dudley and he came with "tips from the top floor" to my podcast here and installed GIMP 2.2.17 on his computer and I would recommend him 2.3 or 2.4 released candidate because they are far better than 2.2 series.
And he is asking about a book "Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional" by Akkana Peck and I have this book.
It is really good if you are starting with the GIMP or you have a bit knowledge then it’s a very good book and it's hands on the book
and I can really recommend that book.
And if you want to buy it and you are staying in United States, I will put a link into the block where you can buy this book via offer and the shop owner gets some money out of that.
Yesterday I got a nasty shock when I started my work again, after the summer break. And that should be shocking enough but I looked the 1st time in Meet the Gimp block with a Windows computer and in Internet Explorer.
And I was really shocked because all the images were blown up and nothing was fitting into the frames and so on.
As a last thing in the show, I have a link tip for you.
The "Photocast Network" is a greater source for photo podcast and I am already a member but I am not on the website.
Check out the website. There is a podcast made by the members of the "Photocast Network" and it is called "Focus Ring" and just today episode 8 came out.
And eventually Meet The Gimp will pop out here on the left side.
I want to ask you for a favor; spread the word about Meet The GIMP. And if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org and  more information is available at

Now this will be a numerical value. This will be an integer or decimal, depending on the user-input. This will also be the same and this will be the string value of either 'add' 'subtract' 'multiply' or 'divide'.
Okay, we have got a quite long decimal number. So you can see that this is quite good function that we have made. We have got our first number, our second number and an operator.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Report Writing in LaTeX. I am calling it “latek” and not “latex”.
My name is Kannan Moudgalya.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to write a document.
In particular, how to use ‘report’ and ‘article’ class,
I am creating this tutorial on our less than 10,000 Rupee laptop.
And, I am using Ubuntu Linux, TeXworks and LaTeX.
You can also use TeXworks on Windows or Mac - the method is identical.
You can use LaTeX by itself, without TeXworks also.
You are welcome to use more expensive Linux computers also!
The prerequisites to learn this are the following:
Information on all of the above are available on our website: spoken tutorial dot org.
Let me go to the TeXworks window.
I have already opened the file report.tex. Please download this file and practise along with me.
I am using 12 point as the font size, ‘a4 paper’ and ‘article’ class.
I am using the geometry package to set margins, through the 'usepackage' command.
A reverse slash should come at the beginning of every command.
Although I will not say it explicitly, you should not forget to put the reverse slash.
Similarly, I will not explicitly mention braces, but you may have to use them.
Please reproduce exactly what is done in the video.
The usepackage command has optional parameters inside square brackets.
The name of the package is within braces.
I have set horizontal and vertical margins of 4.5 cm each.
Look at the top left hand corner of the 'TexWorks’ window.
In case 'pdfLaTeX’ is not already chosen, please select it from the pull down menu.
To the left, there is a green circle with an arrow.
Click the arrow and compile this file.
We get the file ‘report.pdf’ shown on the right hand side.
Look at the titles - section, sub-section and sub-sub-section in the output file.
These are created using identical commands given in the source file.
Observe the distinctive features of these section titles in the 'pdf' file.
The sizes of these titles are created proportionately and automatically.
Also, the section title is the largest and the sub-sub-section title is the smallest.
Irrespective of blank lines in the source file, the output remains the same.
Let me delete one line here. Compile.
There is no change here.
Let me now change the paper size to a5.
This will reduce the width of every line in the output.
Let me compile the text as we did before.
Let me magnify it by pressing control + so that you can see the output clearly.
Let me bring it to the centre.
For the rest of this tutorial, we will use the a5 paper only.  You are welcome to change it to a4.
Note that I did not save the file. This is because TexWorks saves the file automatically before compilation.
Let us change the font to a smaller one of 10 point and compile.
Hey, the font size has become smaller - should we be surprised?  But, proportional sizing and spacing remain the same.
Let me change the font back to 12 point.
We will now discuss another important aspect of section titles.
It is the automatic generation of section numbers.
To illustrate this further, I will add a new section called ‘Inserted section’.
On compilation, it appears here with a correct number in sequence. Thus, numbering also is automatically taken care of by LaTeX.
LaTeX creates table of contents through a file with extension “toc”.
Let me add ‘table of contents’, one word, here.
Compile.
The word ‘Contents’ appears in the output but nothing else.
Let me compile once again.
All the titles are now present in the table of contents along with page numbers.
You have to compile it the third time to get the correct page numbers.
Why three times? Please see the assignment.
Just one word, ‘table of contents’, is what is needed.
What an amazing capability in LaTeX!
This is achieved through a file with extension “toc” that LaTeX maintains.
This multi pass compilation procedure works with changes in titles as well.
Let me change the section title to ‘Modified section’.
Let me compile it. Table of Contents does not change.
Let me compile it once more and solve this problem.
Now we have a modified section here.
We will create a title for this document. Let me do it here, just before ‘begin document’.
I will create a ‘title’, ‘Author’ information and the ‘date’ as follows.
So, I have added these three commands.
Order in which these come or the place where they come does not matter.
But they should come before the begin document command.
Don’t forget the reverse slash in all the commands.
Double slash here means the next line. We compile it.
There are no changes in the ‘pdf’ file.
The reason is that I have not told LaTeX what to do with this information.
So, I add the ‘make title’ command, one word, just after the 'begin document'.
Let me compile it.
The title appears in the output, at the place where I put this command
namely, at the beginning of the document.
We will now change the class of this document from article to report.
Simultaneously, we define a chapter with this command: 'Chapter First Chapter'.
Report style requires at least one chapter.
Let us compile it and see the output.
Notice the changes in the output.
Title appears on a whole page that has no number.
Contents also appear on an entire page, with page number 1.
Please pause here and find out how many entries in 'Contents' are wrong.
Let us go to the next page. Notice the way the chapter begins.
How many distinguishing features can you identify? You should find at least five.
Let us compile it for the second time.
Observe that the Contents page now has the correct information. The page numbers are correct now.
Let us add a chapter, called ‘New Chapter’.
Compile it.
Let me compile once again and see it coming on a new page.
Insert the command appendix before this new chapter.
On compilation, you see the word “Appendix” appearing.
The chapter number is A.
Let us go to the slides now.
Let us summarize what we learnt in this tutorial.
Writing a document in LaTeX,
Let me give some assignments.
This assignment is on a4 paper and letter paper.
Please pause the video, read the slide and do the assignment.
This assignment is on font size.
This is on report dot toc.
This is on number of compilations.
This is on the location of Table of Contents.
This assignment is on the use of the 'chapter' command in 'report' and 'article'.
This assignment is on the effect of the 'appendix' command in the 'report' class.
This is the same as the previous assignment, but in the 'article' class.
This is on the geometry package.
This assignment is on LaTeX classes, in general.

This tutorial is about Navigation – Moving in 3D space in Blender 2.59.
This script has been contributed by Chirag Raman and edited by Monisha Banerjee.
After watching this tutorial, we shall learn how to pan, rotate and zoom within a 3D space such as the Blender view port.
Navigation in  Blender depends a lot on the type of mouse you have –
a 3 button mouse
or a 2 button mouse
with a wheel.
I am using a 2 button mouse with a wheel for this series of Blender Tutorials.
The first action we shall see is Panning a view.
There are three ways of doing this using the mouse and the keyboard.
First, we use the Shift key with the mouse wheel or scroll.
Hold shift, press down  the mouse-wheel and move the mouse.
The scene pans in the direction of the mouse movement, both- left to right  and  up and down .
Now, hold Shift and scroll the mouse wheel up and down.
The scene pans up and down. This is the second method of Panning the view.
Hold Shift and scroll the mouse wheel downwards. The view pans upwards.
Hold Shift and scroll the mouse wheel upwards. The view pans downwards.
Third and last method of Panning the view is to use the Ctrl key with the mouse wheel.
Hold Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel. The view pans from left to right and vice versa.
Hold Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel upwards. The view pans to the right.
Hold Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel downwards. The view pans to the left.
You can also use your numpad keys to pan the view.
Hold ctrl and numpad2, the view pans upwards.
Hold Ctrl & numpad 8, the view pans downwards.
Hold Ctrl & numpad 4, the view pans to the left.
Hold Ctrl & numpad 6, the view pans to the right.
If you are using a laptop, you need to emulate your number keys as numpad. To learn how to emulate numpad, see the tutorial on User Preferences.
Right. The next action we shall see is to rotate the view.
Press down your mouse wheel and move the mouse in a square pattern.
That gives us turntable rotation.
You can also use the Trackball type of rotation in Blender for little more flexibility over the action of rotation.
For this, you need to change the option Turntable to  Trackball in the User Preferences window.
To learn how to do this, see the tutorial on User Preferences.</p>
Rotating the view can be done either
left to right or up and down.
Now let us rotate the view left to right.
Hold ctrl, alt and scroll the mouse wheel up and down. The view rotates left to right and vice versa.
Hold ctrl, alt and scroll the mouse wheel upwards. The view rotates to the left.
Hold ctrl, alt and scroll the mouse wheel downwards. The view rotates to the right.</p>
You can also use the short cut keys 4 and 6 on the num pad.
Press numpad 4, the view rotates to the left.
Press num pad 6, the view rotates to the right.
Now we rotate the view up and down.
Hold Shift, Alt and scroll the mouse wheel up and down. The view rotates up and down.
Hold Shift, Alt and scroll the mouse  wheel upwards. The view rotates downwards.
Hold Shift, Alt and scroll the mouse wheel downwards. The view rotates upwards.
You can also use the shortcut keys 2 and 8 on the numpad.
Press numpad 2, the view rotates upwards.
Press numpad 8, the view rotates downwards.
Last action is Zooming the view.
Scroll the mouse-wheel upwards to zoom in.
Scroll the mouse wheel downwards to zoom out. Easy! Isn’t it?
For shortcut, use the plus and minus  keys on the numpad.
Press numpad '+' to zoom-in.
Press numpad '–'  to zoom-out.
That wraps up our tutorial on Navigating in 3D space within the Blender View port.
Now try to pan, rotate and zoom the 3D view. All the best!

You should be familiar with  GNU/Linux Operating System.
Ubuntu Linux 12.04  OS and
Let us start with an introduction to test.
test is a built-in command which returns the exit status.
It returns 0 (zero) for True and 1 (one) for False.
Return value depends on the evaluation of the expression.
One can get the return status by typing Dollar and question mark sign ($?).
An expression can be evaluated in two ways-
One- by using the keyword  test.
And other by using the expression enclosed within square brackets.
Now, open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously.
Type: test space 4 space hyphen eq space 4 semicolon space echo space dollar sign and a question mark. Press  Enter.
It returns  zero  which means  True.
4 is equal to 4.
Next, type:
opening square bracket space 4 space hyphen eq space 4 space closing square bracket semicolon space echo space dollar sign and a question mark. Press Enter.
It returns zero which means  True.
i.e.4 is equal to 4.
Let's take another expression. Type:
It returns one which means False.
i.e.4 is not equal to 5.
Now let's write the same expression within square brackets. Type:
opening square bracket space 4 space hyphen eq space 5 space closing square bracket semicolon space echo space dollar sign and a question mark. Press Enter.
It also returns one which means False.
i.e. 4 is not equal to 5.
This can be extended for other kind of testing.
Please type: man space test and explore its usage.
Now, let us go back to our slides.
Now we will see the syntax for if statement-
if space opening square bracket space expression space closing square bracket semicolon space then
On the next line, type: commands or  statements that you want to execute.
Lastly, end the if loop with fi.
The basic rules of condition are:
Always keep spaces between the brackets and the expression.
Always terminate the line using semicolon before keyword “then”.
Semicolon is used to terminate the statement or an expression.
It is recommended to quote string variables if you use them in condition.
Don't forget to close the conditional block with “fi”.
Let us see an example on if statement.
I will open an already existing script file named simpleif.sh.
This Bash script displays the message “count is 100” when the count equals to 100.
This is the first line of Bash shell script known as shebang line.
An integer 100 is assigned to a variable count.
Note that there should not be any space between count, = and 100.
This expression checks whether count is equal to hundred.
Here, -eq is comparison operator.
If the condition is True, it will display the message count is 100.
fi is to end if block.
Now save the file by pressing Ctrl + S.
Go back to the Terminal.
To make the file executable, type: chmod space plus x space simpleif.sh and press Enter.
Now type: dot slash simpleif.sh press Enter.
Here it is displayed:
Count is 100.
Try changing the value of variable count  and execute the script.
Now switch back to our slides.
We will see  if-else condition.
The general syntax is: if space opening square bracket space condition space closing square bracket space semicolon space then
On the next line, type commands.
On the next line, there is else statement.
And again type some other commands.
on the next line, type fi to end if block.
Let us study the usage of if-else with an interesting password program.
I will open the file ifelse.sh.
Here,abc123 is stored in the variable PASS.
As abc123 is a string, it should be written within double-quotes.
In this case, standard input is our keyboard.
Hyphen s is for silent mode
which means the entered password will not be displayed as we type.
We don't want others to see our password.
Hyphen p is for prompt.
It will display a string “'Enter password: ” before it takes input from user.
mypassword is a variable.
It stores the string, in this case the password entered by the user.
This checks that the entered password matches the value of the variable PASS.
It is stored in a variable mypassword.
If the password matches, it  displays the message:
“Password accepted”
else it will display “Access denied”.
fi is the end of if-else loop.
Now save the file by pressing Ctrl, s.
Come back to our terminal, make the file executable. Type:chmod space plus x space ifelse.sh. Press Enter.
Type: dot slash ifelse.sh . Press  Enter.
Here it is displayed :
Enter password: I will type abc. Press Enter.
As the password entered is wrong, it displays the message as  “Access denied”.
Let's execute again but this time we will enter password as abc123.
It is displayed as: Password accepted.
Come back to our slides and summarize.
In this tutorial, we have covered usage of test command, simple if statement and if-else statement.
Write a script, take your name as an input.
It should check this name with your system's username.
If the username matches, it should greet you by displaying “Hello”.
Else, it should display “Try again”.
HINT: Your system's username is stored in a variable $USER.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Nested-If and Ternary Operator in java.
By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:
For this tutorial we are using:
To follow this tutorial, you should know
about the usage of relational and logical operators
and if...else control flow statements.
Nested if statements: An If statement within another if statement  is called a nested-if statement.
Now let us look at the syntax for writing the Nested-If statement.
In this case, if condition1 is true, then the program checks for condition2.
Condition 2 is given using another if statement.
If condition2 is true then the program executes Statement or block 1.
Else, it executes Statement or block 2.
If condition1 is false then the program will not check condition2.
Instead it will directly jump to its else statement i.e. block 3.
Now, let us try an example to understand that better.
We have the eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class NesedIfDemo and added the main method to it.
We shall check if the given number is an even number or an odd number.
we will also handle negative numbers using a nested-if.
So, inside the main method type:
int n = minus 5;
We have created a variable 'n'  to store the negative number.
Now, we shall write the if conditions.
Next line, type: if (n  < 0)
open curly bracket. Press Enter.
System.out.println within brackets and double quotes Negative number;
We first see if the number is a negative number.
If yes, then we will not check for even and odd.
If the number is not a negative, we check for 'even' and 'odd'.
Next line, type:else open curly bracket. Press Enter.
Now, if the execution has come to the else part,
it means that the number is non-negative.
So, we check for odd or even inside this else part.
Type:if within brackets n modulus 2  double equal to 0 open curly bracket press Enter.
System.out.println  within brackets and double quotes Even number;
Then type the else part. else open curly braket, press Enter.
Type: System.out.println within brackets and double quotes Odd number semicolon.
So, we make sure that negative numbers are not considered for 'odd' or 'even' check.
Now, let us see the code in action.
Save and run the file. As we can see, we get the output  as negative number.
Now let us try a positive number.
Change n = -5 to n = 5.
Now Save and Run the file.
As we can see, the output is Odd number as expected. Let us try an even number.
Change n = 5 to n = 10.
Now Save and run the file.
As we can see, the output is Even number as expected.
This process of including an if statement inside another, is called nested-if.
There is no limit to the amount of nesting.
But it is a good practice to not go beyond 3 levels of nesting.
Now we shall look at the ternary operator.
First, let me clean up the main method.
We shall write a program that divides a number by 2.
It is a very trivial program but the issue comes in dividing odd numbers.
When 7 is divided by 2, we get 3.
But what if we want the result to be rounded off.
Which means, when 7 is divided by 2, we get  4 and not 3.
In simple terms, we need the next number.
Let us see how to write such a program.See, inside the main method type:  int n, nHalf semicolon.
We will store the number in n and the half number in nHalf
Next line, type: n = 5 semicolon.
Next line, type: if within bracket n modulus 2 == 0 open curly brackets. Press Enter.
Type: nHalf = n / 2 semicolon.
In the else part, type: within curly brackets nHalf equal to within brackets n+1 the whole divided by 2 semicolon.
We check if the number is even or odd and do the division accordingly.
Now  Let us add a print statement to see the program in action.
So, type System.out.println within brackets nHalf semicolon.
Now  Save and Run the file.
As we can see, our objective is met. We get the output as 3 and not 2.
But if we notice, all we are doing is setting the value of a variable depending on a condition.
There is more syntax than logic in our program.
This is when ternary operator makes code simpler.
Ternary Operator is a conditional operator providing results similar to nested-if.
It Provides a short syntax and is denoted by a question mark.
It takes three operands at a time.
Let us learn about the syntax of Ternary Operator.
The Expression is the condition that has to be checked.
Operand 1 is the value of the variable. Result if the condition is true.
Operand 2 is the value if the condition is false.
Now Let us use it in our program.
First, let us remove the if-else statement.
Type: nHalf equal to  n modulus 2 double equal to 0 question mark n / 2 colon within brackets n + 1 the whole divided by 2 semicolon.
This statement reads:
If 'n' is even, 'nHalf' is 'n by 2'. Otherwise it is 'n plus 1 by 2'.
Let us now see it in action.
Save and Runthe file. Press Ctrl S and Ctrl F11 keys.
This way, ternary operator reduces clutter in the code and improves readability.
About Nested-If Statements and Ternary Operator and
Usage of Nested-If Statements and Ternary Operator in a Java program.
Now take an assignment on Nested-If and Ternary operator.  Write java program for the following.
Check whether a number is even and also a multiple of 11 using nested-if.
Identify the largest number among the two given numbers using Ternary operator.

Create simple queries in SQL View, write simple SQL.
Use SELECT, FROM and WHERE clauses
And choose upper lower or mixed cases for naming fields and tables .
Before using Base to create queries in SQL View, let us talk about LibreOffice Base.
Base runs on the HSQL database engine.
This is an open source database engine software written in Java. Go to:
Okay, now let us learn about SQL.
SQL stands for 'Structured Query Language'. It is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
It is an internationally accepted ANSI standard.
And so, it is used in a variety of 'Database Management Systems' or 'DBMS'.
Some examples are our own LibreOffice Base, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle and DB2.
The most common use of SQL is to retrieve data from a database which is also known as querying a database.
SQL can also be used for inserting data into a database, updating data or deleting data from a database.
And we have done all of these operations using Base, in our previous tutorials,
by using the very user friendly wizards and designing windows.
But knowing the underlying query language gives us more flexibility and power to query the database And SQL can also be used not only to modify data but also to modify database and table structures.
Since our tutorial does not cover all about SQL, here are some useful tutorials and their websites. <pause>.
HSQLDB has its own user guides. They can be viewed online Or they can be downloaded and saved into your computer as a PDF file.
Okay, let us learn some SQL now. We will open our familiar Library database example.
Let’s open our 'Library' database. Now, let us click on the Queries list on the left panel
and then click on ‘Create Query in SQL View’. Now we see a blank window titled Query Design
and this is where we will type in our queries in SQL.
Let us write our first simple query. And that is: Get information about all books in the library. Simple..
Any retrieval needs to use a SELECT keyword. And so, we will write our query as-
SELECT * FROM Books.
Here, Books is the table name. Notice the capital 'B' in books.
We will faithfully follow the table or column names we used earlier.
And '*' is a wild card. Here, it means- get all the fields or columns from the Books table.
Now, let us execute or run it. Click on Edit menu and then click on Run Query.
Now we see a top panel with a list of records on books.
We can save this query or any query we write and give them descriptive names.
So, there is our first simple query! Here are some tips:
HSQLDB is case sensitive with its Database object names such as tables and column names.
Meaning- Table name “Books” with a Capital 'B' is not the same as “books” with a small 'b'.
But, for convenience we can use all upper cases or all lower cases.
For example: 'BOOKS' in capital letters, or 'members' in small letters etc.
But, using mixed cases can be easy to read and understand. For example: 'BooksIssued', with a capital 'B' and 'I'.
Or 'ReturnDate' with a capital 'R' and 'D'.
So, we have to use the table names and column names just the way they are created.
For SQL keywords like SELECT, we can use any case or mix cases. But, let us be uniform in our usage for better readability.
In our examples, we will use all upper cases for keywords.
Now, onto our next query. We can type this query in a new window or we can overwrite it on the previous query.
For now, let us overwrite it on the previous query.
Let us retrieve specific columns from the Books table.
And run the query. We can also use the Run Query icon below the file menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut F5.
And there are our records with only those columns that we needed.
Okay. Let us move on.
Let us introduce conditions or criteria for our query.
We will retrieve only those books published by Cambridge.
And so, our query is: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher = 'Cambridge'.
Notice that we have introduced a new keyword WHERE
followed by a condition where we say 'Publisher' equals 'Cambridge'.
Let us run our query now and we see only those books for which the publisher is 'Cambridge'.
And so, we can have any number of conditions or criteria in a query.
Let us write a query with two conditions.
Let us retrieve only those books published by Cambridge and only those that were published after the year 1975.
And our query is: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher = 'Cambridge' AND PublishedYear > 1975.
And we see two conditions after the WHERE keyword or clause.
Notice that they are put together using ‘AND’. Here ‘AND’ is called a logical operator
and here it serves to combine conditions. ‘OR’ is another logical operator.
Explore these by using them in the above query later.
Let us now run the query and see the results at the top.
There, these are the books that met our conditions.
Okay, let us also learn another way to include multiple conditions.
How can we get a list of only those books for which the publisher is Cambridge or Oxford or both?
And here is our query: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher IN ( 'Cambridge', 'Oxford').
Notice the new keyword ‘IN’.
It helps to combine conditions based on a single column- in this case, the Publisher.
And notice the results now.
1. Get information about all the members in the Library.
Let us learn more about SQL in the next tutorial.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Queries in SQL View in LibreOffice Base.
Create simple queries in SQL View.
Write simple SQL
Use SELECT, FROM , and WHERE clauses
And choose upper, lower, or mixed cases for naming fields and tables.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on embedding mathematics in Xfig.
In this tutorial, I shall explain how to create this figure.
Observe the mathematical expression in the second block.
You can embed any mathematical expression after learning this tutorial.
We shall create the figure in the previous slide, starting from this figure, which was created in the spoken tutorial on “Feedback Diagrams through Xfig”.
You should learn this tutorial before starting the current one.
Let me now explain, what all you need to learn the material taught in this course.
I am using Xfig Version 3.2, patch level 5.
You also need LaTeX and a familiarity with it.
You also need image cropping software.
pdfcrop works on Linux and Mac OS X. We will cover it in this tutorial.
Briss is said to work on Windows also, but not covered in this tutorial.
Let us go to Xfig.
Let us choose the File, then Open.
If we scroll through the list, we will see the file “feedback.fig”, created in the spoken tutorial on “Feedback Diagrams through Xfig”. Let us click it.
We will see the figure inside this box.
Let us open it.
Let us bring it inside.
Let us also zoom it.
Using the Save as option on “File”, we will save this figure as maths.
Let us save it.
We now have the file "maths.fig".
Let us select “Edit” and click the text “Plant”.
Let me take the mouse here. Let me delete this and enter
Make sure that the mouse stays within the box while typing.
The default value for “Flag”' is “Normal” - change it to “Special”.
Click “Done”.
As the text is long, it overlaps with other entries.
Let us move the text outside the box and work with it.
Let me choose Grid Mode.
Once we are satisfied with any changes that we may want here, we can put it back inside the box.
Let us save this file.
Let us export using combined pdf and Latex files.
File > Export > Combined pdf/LaTeX. Let us Export.
There is an error message that I get. But let us not worry about this.
Let me go to the terminal.
Let me type ls -lrt.
We get a list of files, with the last one being the most recent.
The last two files are maths.pdf_t and maths.pdf.
Let us give the command open maths.pdf.
Let us bring it inside.
We can see the block diagram without the mathematical expression.
Let me close this.
Let us see maths.pdf_t in emacs editor that I have already opened.
It is here. Let me open it.
Please note that you do NOT have to use emacs.
You can use WHATEVER editor that you are comfortable with.
You can see  that the “picture” environment is used.
It also makes use of includegraphics and color packages – we need to tell LaTeX to take care of this requirement.
Let me now open the file maths-bp.tex; I have already created for this tutorial.
I have used article class.
I have used color and graphicx packages as these are used in the file pdf_t, the one we saw earlier.
I want empty pagestyle as I do not want the page number.
Finally, I want to include the file maths.pdf_t.
Let us invoke the command pdflatex maths-bp in the terminal.
We get the message that the maths-bp.pdf is created.
Let us open it with the command open maths-bp.pdf.
We have the file we want. Let me zoom it.
Now that we know that the mathematical expression is working, let us move the text inside the block.
Let us save and export. It is already in the required language. Export.
Let us dismiss this warning.
Let me compile it again.
Let us click the pdf browser that has the file.
Now you see the mathematical expression inside the box, the way we want.
Let us now see what happens if we do not choose the Special flag.
Let me come here.
Let me edit the text, change the Special Flag to Normal. Done.
File > Save. Let me export.
Let me compile. Let me come here.
The formula is no longer in the form we want.
Let us change the “Special Flag” back to “Special”.
Save, Export.
Recompile. You see that the file is in the form we want.
Let us now improve the appearance of this formula.
In this case, the use of 'dfrac' will make the fraction look better.
In view of this, let us change 'frac' to 'dfrac'.
Let me click here. Keep the mouse inside the box.
Put 'd' here. Done. Save, Export.
Let us compile once again using pdflatex.
We get the error message “Undefined control sequence” "\dfrac".
LaTeX complains because the command \dfrac is defined in the package “Amsmath” but we have not included it.
We need to include it in the file maths-bp.tex'.
Let us do it. Let us go to emacs.
Enter “\usepackage{amsmath}”.
Let us save the file. Let us compile once again. Let me first exit.
Let me now recompile. Now it compiles. Let us click this.
We see that the fraction has now come out nicely.
We have now achieved our objective of learning how to embed mathematical expressions in Xfig.
It is important to note that Xfig does not interpret the LaTeX commands at all.
The interpretation is done by the “pdflatex” command.
The LaTeX commands have to be correct and consistent at the time of compilation.
We will now explain how to remove the white space around the figure.
Let me go to the terminal.
Let me type the command “pdfcrop maths-bp.pdf” - this is the file we created, into “maths-out.pdf”.
Pdfcrop says, one page written on this file.
“pdfcrop” takes an input file, trims the space around the figure and writes out the cropped file in the output file.
“pdfcrop” is already installed in my system.
If you do not have it, you need to install it first.
Let us view this output file by the command, “open maths-out.pdf”.
Let me bring it inside.
The figure has now become extremely compact.
The white space that was here has been completely removed.
We can now insert this into documents.
Let me close this. Let me close this also. Let me close this also.
Let me come back to the slides.
The software “briss” can also be used to crop the white space.
It is supposed to work on Linux, Mac OS X and also on Windows.
I have checked its working on Mac OS X. But we will not demonstrate it here.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.
We have an assignment for you. Make the diagram created in this tutorial more symmetric and beautiful.
Try out different mathematical expressions.
Try out other options such as flip and rotate, not covered in the spoken tutorial.
Try to build different diagrams. Explore the library.
Do an internet search and locate information relevant to Xfig.
Useful learning material is available at spoken-tutorial.org. It is here.
The concept of spoken tutorials is explained in "What is a Spoken Tutorial?".
You may learn LaTeX using the spoken tutorials, available here, which I have downloaded in this tab.
The tutorial on Mathematical Typesetting explains how to create maths in LaTeX.
The tutorial on Tables and Figures explains how to place figures of the type created in this tutorial into documents.
This website has a lot of information, including Xfig tutorials. Come back to the slides.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Characteristics of Sound Waves.
In this tutorial, we will learn to demonstrate:
And, show:
Let's first begin with definition of sound.
It requires a medium to propagate. The medium can be air, water or any metal surface.
In this tutorial, we will carry out various experiments to show characteristics of sound waves.
Let's perform an experiment to show frequency of sound waves.
In this experiment, ground(GND) is connected to Piezo buzzer (PIEZO).
Microphone (MIC) is connected to A1. Here, Piezo buzzer(PIEZO) is a source of sound.
On the Plot window, under Setting Square waves, set the frequency as 3500Hz.
Click on SQR1 check-box. Frequency of SQR1 is set to 3500Hz. A digitized sound wave is generated.
Move the frequency slider to change the waveform.
Click on SQ1 and drag to CH2. Input data of SQ1 is assigned to CH2. A square wave is generated.
Drag the mSec/div slider to set in compressions and rarefactions.
Click on CH2 and drag to FIT. Voltage and frequency of SQ1 are displayed on the right-side.
Move the frequency slider to set in sound waves.
Sound wave produced by the Piezo buzzer is shown in black colour.
Amplitude of the wave changes as Piezo buzzer is moved closer and away from the MIC respectively.
Now, we will demonstrate frequency response of Piezo buzzer.
On the Plot window click on EXPERIMENTS button. Select Experiment list opens. Click on  Frequency Response from the list.
Two new windows Audio Frequency response Curve and Schematic open. Schematic window shows the circuit diagram of the experiment.
On the Audio Frequency response Curve window, click on  START button.
Frequency response of the Piezo buzzer is set in. Frequency response has maximum amplitude at 3700Hz.
On the same window, click on Grace button. Grace window opens showing Frequency response Curve.
Now, we will measure velocity of the source of sound.
On the Plot window, click on EXPERIMENTS button.
Two new windows EYES Junior: Velocity of Sound and Schematic open. Schematic window shows the circuit diagram of the experiment.
On EYES Junior: Velocity of Sound window, click on Measure Phase button.
We can obtain different Phase values by changing the distance between MIC and Piezo buzzer.
Click Measure Phase button to obtain different Phase values.
From the various Phase values, we will use 178 deg and 106 deg to calculate the velocity of sound.
We can obtain these values when Piezo is kept close and 2cm away from the MIC.
To obtain accurate results, ensure that MIC and Piezo buzzer are placed on the same axis.
To calculate the value of velocity of sound, we have the formula as shown.
As an assignment, calculate the value of wavelength of sound. Formula: λ= v/f(Lambda = v upon f).
Now, we will demonstrate:
To show Grace plots in the experiments,
make sure that you have installed:
In this experiment, we use two Piezo buzzers as source of sound.
In this experiment, Piezo 1 is connected to SQR1 and ground(GND). Piezo 2 is connected to SQR2 and ground(GND). This is the circuit diagram.
On the Plot window, set frequency as 3500Hz.
Click on SQR1 and SQR2 check-boxes. Frequency of SQR1 and SQR2 is set to “3500Hz”.
A digitized sound wave is generated.
Move the frequency slider to change the waveform.
Click on EXPERIMENTS button and select Interference of Sound. EYES: Interference of Sound window opens.
At the bottom of the window, change NS, that is, number of samples value to 1000.
Click on SQR1 and SQR2 check-boxes. Click on START button. Interference pattern is seen.
Now, click on Xmgrace button. A new window opens with a Grace pattern.
Now, we will show Beats pattern.
Click on EXPERIMENTS button and select Interference of Sound.
At the bottom of the window, click on SQR1 and SQR2 check-boxes.
Click on START button. Beats pattern appears.
Now, click on Xmgrace button. A new window opens with a Grace pattern.
Click on FFT. A new window opens with Fourier Transform.
To know more about Fourier Transform , please visit this webpage.
Let us perform an experiment to show a low frequency sound wave. This is the circuit diagram.
Click on EXPERIMENTS button and select Interference of Sound. EYES: Interference of Sound window opens.
At the bottom of the window, set the value of SQR1 to 100 and check the box.
Click on START button, a low amplitude wave is displayed.
Click on FFT to obtain a Grace plot of Fourier Transform.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Arithmetic & Relational Operators in Ruby.
Arithmetic Operators
Operator Precedence
Relational Operators.
Here we are using:  Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 , Ruby 1.9.3
To follow this tutorial, you must know how to use Terminal and Text editor in Linux.
You must also be familiar with 'irb'.
Now, let us learn about arithmetic operators.
Ruby has the following arithmetic operators.
'+' Addition, e.g. a+b.
'-' Subtraction, e.g. a-b.
'/' Division, e.g. a/b.
'*' Multiplication, e.g. a*b.
'%' Modulus, e.g. a%b.
'**' Exponent,  e.g. a**b.
Let us try these arithmetic operators using irb.
Open the terminal by pressing  Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously.
Type "irb" and press Enter to launch the interactive Ruby.
Type: 10 plus 20 and press Enter.
The addition operation is performed and the result 30 is displayed.
Similarly, the subtraction and multiplication operations can be performed.
Let us try the division operator.
Type: 10 slash 4
Here you can see the result is truncated to the nearest whole number which is 2.
To get a more accurate answer, we need to express one number as float.
Type: 10.0 slash 4
Now we get the result as 2.5.
Let's now try the  modulus operator.
The modulus operator returns the remainder as output.
Type: 12 percentage sign 5 and press Enter.
Here, 12 is divided by 5 and the remainder 2 is returned back.
Now, let's try the exponent operator.
Type:  2 followed by the asterisk symbol twice and then 5 and press Enter.
This means that 2 is raised to the power of 5.
So, we get the output as 32.
Next, let us learn about operator precedence.
When several operations occur in a mathematical expression,
each part is evaluated
and resolved in a predetermined order called operator precedence.
This means that the operator which has the highest priority is executed first.
This is then followed by the next operator in the priority order and so on.
This slide lists all operators from highest precedence to lowest.
For example,  3 + 4 * 5  returns 23 and not 35.
The multiplication operator asterisk (*) has higher precedence than the addition operator plus (+)
and thus will be evaluated first.
Hence, four fives are twenty and then three is added to 20 to give the output as 23.
Let's see some more examples based on operator precedence.
Let's go back to the terminal and
press  Crtl, L keys simultaneously to clear the irb console.
Now, type: 7 minus 2 multiply by 3
and press Enter .
We get the answer as 1.
Here, the asterisk symbol has higher priority than the minus sign.
So, the multiplication operation is performed first and then subtraction is performed.
Let's see another example.
Type: within brackets 10 plus 2 slash 4
and press Enter. We get the answer as 3.
In this case, () bracket has the higher priority than  division (slash).
So, the operation inside the bracket, that is addition, is performed first.
Then division is performed.
Now, let us learn about Relational Operators.
Let's switch back to the slides.
Relational operators are also known as comparison operators.
Expressions using relational operators return boolean values.
Relational operators in Ruby are-
== Equals to,  e.g. a==b
dot eql question mark  e.g. a.eql?b
!=  Not equals to  e.g.  a exclamation equals b
< Less than  e.g. a < b
> Greater than  e.g. a > b
<= Lesser than or equal to   e.g. a less than arrow equals b
>= Greater than or equal to  e.g. a greater than arrow equals b
<=> Combined comparison e.g. a less than arrow equal greater than arrow b.
Now let us try some of these operators.
Press ctrl, L keys simultaneously to clear the irb console.
Let's try  equals to operator.
So, type:  10 equals equals 10
and press Enter. We get the output as "true".
The .eql? opeartor is same as  equals to operator.
Let's try it out.  Now, type  10 .eql?10 and press Enter.
We get the output as "true".
Now, let's try  not equal to operator.
Type:  10 not equal 10
We get the output as "false".
This is because the two numbers are equal.
Clear the  irb console by pressing Ctrl, L simultaneously.
Now, let us  try  less than operator.
Type: 10 less than 5 and press Enter.
Here, if first operand is less than second then it will return "true".
Otherwise, it will return "false".
We get the output as "false" because 10 is not less than 5.
We will now try greater than operator.
Type: 5 greater than 2.
Here, if first operand is greater than second then it will return "true";
otherwise it will return "false".
Press  Enter.
In this case, we get the output as "true" because 5 is indeed greater than 2.
Clear the irb console by pressing  Ctrl, L simultaneously.
We will now try the less than equal to operator.
Type: 12 less than equal 12
Here, if first operand is less than or equal to the second then it returns "true";
otherwise it returns "false".
We get the output as "true" because 12 is equal to 12.
You can try out the  greater than or equal to operator likewise.
Now, let's try the combined comparison operator.
The  combined comparison operator:
Returns 0 if first operand equals second
Returns 1 if first operand is greater than the second and
Returns -1 if first operand is less than the second operand.
Let's see how it works, with an example.
Type: 3 less than equals greater than 3
We get the output as 0
because both the operands are equal i.e. both are three.
Now, let's change one of the operands to 4.
Type: 4 less than equals greater than 3
and press Enter.We get the output as 1
since 4 is greater than 3.
Now, let's change this example again.
Type: 4 less than equals greater than 7
and press Enter .
We get the output as -1. Since 4 is less than 7.
solve the following examples using irb and check the output:
10 +  bracket 2 asterisk 5 bracket 8 slash 2
4 asterisk 5 slash 2 plus 7
Also, try arithmetic operators using methods.
Let's summarize..
Arithmetic Operators-  plus, minus, asterisk, slash standing for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
Operator Precedence
Relational Operators
using many examples.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Basic Data Manipulation in Calc.
Use some basic Formula in Calc
Sort by columns and  Filter data
What is a formula?
A formula is an equation that uses numbers and variables to get a result.
The variables are cell locations that hold the data needed for the equation.
Basic Arithmetic Operations
That is Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Open the Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
Let’s sum up the cost of all the expenses mentioned under the heading Cost.
We will type Sum Total just under Miscellaneous.
Then click on cell A8 and type the serial number as 7.
Now click on cell C8 which is where we want to display the sum total of the costs.
Type is equal to SUM and within braces the range of columns to be added.
Observe that all the amounts under Cost get added and sum total is displayed in cell C8.
Next, let’s learn how to do subtraction in Calc.
Say we want to subtract the cost of the House Rent and Electricity Bill.
We will display this in cell C10.
So click on cell C10 and type the following-
It shows the subtracted value of C3 and C4.
Click on cell C11 and type “is equal to C5 asterix C6” and press Enter.
The answer of the multiplication is shown in cell C11.
Click on cell C12 and type “is equal to C3 forward slash C6 and press Enter.
The answer of the division is shown in cell C12.
Let's undo the changes of division, multiplication and subtraction that we made.
To do so, press the Ctrl+Z key combination thrice.
Another basic operation in a spreadsheet is to find the average of numbers.
In cell B9, let's type the heading as Average.
Next click on cell C9.
And type is equal to Average and within braces C3 colon C7.
We see that the average of the Cost column gets displayed in the cell.
Let's undo the changes by pressing Ctrl+Z keys.
In the same way, we can find the average of elements in a horizontal row also.
We will learn about other formulae and operators later in this series.
Now let’s learn how to sort data in a Calc spreadsheet.
Sorting organises rows and columns in a spreadsheet in a meaningful order.
Sorting helps us to analyse and visualize data more effectively.
It makes it easier to find and retrieve an item from the entire sheet.
We can sort data using upto three criteria, which are then applied one after another.
Sorting can be applied to the entire sheet or a range of cells
Data is typically sorted based on actual values. For eg: ascending, descending, alphabetic, left to right, oldest to newest, etc.
We will sort the data under the heading Costs in ascending order.
Now holding down the left mouse button, select the cells C1 to C7.
This selects the range of cells which we want to sort.
Go to the Standard toolbar.
Click on the Sort Ascending icon.
The Sort range dialog box appears.
Click on the Current selection button.
Observe that the numbers in the selected cells are now arranged in ascending order.
Click on the Sort Descending icon.
In the Sort range dialog box, click on the Current selection button.
Observe that the numbers in the selected cells are now arranged in descending order.
The numbers are all back in their original cells.
To have greater control of sorting data, click on the Sort icon.
Alternatively, we can go to the menu bar and click on Data.
In the Sort Range dialog box, once again click on the Current selection button.
This time another Sort dialog box appears with two tabs named Sort criteria and Options.
Sort criteria tab is selected by default.
Under the drop-down in Sort key 1, select Cost.
Then click on the Ascending option just next to it.
To sort in the descending order, click on the Descending option.
Now click on the OK button at the bottom right corner.
We see that column Cost gets sorted in the ascending order.
Let us undo these changes by pressing Ctrl+Z keys.
Multiple columns can also be sorted in one go.
To do so, first select multiple columns, and then apply the sort options.
Let’s say, we want to sort Serial numbers, Items as well as Cost.
So first select all the 3 columns SN, Items and Cost as shown here.
Now go to the menu bar and click on Data.
Sort dialog box opens up.
Under Sort criteria tab, in Sort key 1 drop-down, select Cost.
Then in Sort key 2 drop-down, select SN.
And in Sort key 3 drop-down, select Items.
Click on Descending in the first two sort options.
Click on Ascending in the third sort option.
And then click on the OK button.
Let us undo these changes.
Next let’s learn how to filter data in Calc.
I will demonstrate this feature.
In order to apply a filter, let's click on any cell, for example the cell named Items.
Click on the Auto Filter icon in the Standard toolbar.
Alternatively, you can go to the menu bar and click on Data.
We see that a drop-down arrow appears on the heading Items.
Click on this drop-down arrow.
Filter pop-up box opens up.
Now suppose we want to display only Electricity Bill data.
So first uncheck the option All.
Then check the option Electricity Bill and click on the Ok button.
Only the data related to the Electricity Bill is displayed in the sheet.
In order to view all the data again, click on the dropdown arrow on the cell Items.
Check the option All.
Make sure all the headings are checked and then click on the Ok button.
We are now able to view all the data which we had in the sheet.
There are other filters in Calc which we will learn about in later tutorials of this series.
Let’s save and close the file.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Open “spreadsheet-practice.ods” sheet.
Sort the Salary column in Ascending order
Filter the Name column and display Rahul’s data.
Undo the changes.

Welcome to this tutorial on Dilutions and pH measurement.
In this tutorial, we will learn to measure: Change in pH for solutions of acid and base on dilution.
Variation in pH by common-ion effect for weak acids and bases.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with, ChemCollective Vlabs interface.
Here, I am using: Mac OS version 10.10.5
ChemCollective Vlabs version 2.1.0
Java version 8.
For this demonstration, let us dilute -  0.1 molar Hydrochloric acid to 0.01 molar Hydrochloric acid.
0.1 molar sodium hydroxide to 0.01 molar sodium hydroxide.
For this experiment, 2 ml of 0.1 M Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide is diluted to 20 ml with distilled water.
I have opened a “Virtual Chemistry labs” application window.
Stockroom explorer opens with solutions of various acids and bases.
A list of acidic solutions with various strengths opens.
Double-click to choose 0.1 Molar Hydrocloric acid.
Note that pH Meter reads 1.
Next, from Stockroom explorer, double-click on Strong-bases cabinet.
Double-click to choose point one molar Sodium Hydroxide.
Click on the flask, observe the pH on the pH Meter.
Click on the radio button near Strong-bases cabinet to close the list.
Double click on Distilled water icon from Stockroom explorer.
Let us now add the required apparatus to the workbench.
Click on glassware icon.
From the sub-menu, select 10 mL Graduated Cylinder to add to the workbench.
For this experiment, we need two Graduated cylinders.
From the context menu, select copy.
Right-click and choose Paste option from the menu.
Click on glassware icon.
From the sub-menu, select 250 mL Erlenmeyer Flask.
Label the Graduated Cylinders as A and B.
From the Context-menu, select Rename option.
A text box opens. Type A in the text box and click on Ok button.
Similarly, label the other Graduated Cylinder as B.
Similarly, label Erlenmeyer Flasks as A and B.
Place each set of apparatus at a different position on the workbench.
To perform this experiment, we will dilute 2 ml of 0.1 Molar Hydrocloric acid with 18 ml of distilled water.
Drag 0.1 molar Hydrochloric acid flask over to the Graduated Cylinder A.
In the Transfer amount  input bar, type 2.
Move the flask aside.
Move the Distilled water tank over Flask A.
Click on Pour. Move the Distilled water aside.
Place the Graduated Cylinder A over Flask A.
Change the transfer mode to Realistic transfer.
Move the Graduated Cylinder A aside.
Click on Flask A, observe the pH on the pH meter.
Similarly, let us dilute 0.1 Molar Sodium hydroxide and measure pH.
Measure 2 mL of 0.1 Molar Sodium hydroxide  in Graduated Cylinder B.
Drag 0.1 molar Sodium Hydroxide flask over to Graduated Cylinder B.
Using Tools menu, change the transfer mode to Precise transfer.
In the transfer amount input bar, type 2.
Move the flask aside.
Move the Distilled water tank over Flask B.
In the Transfer amount input bar, type 18.
Move the Distilled water aside.
Transfer 2 ml of sodium hydroxide from Graduated Cylinder B to Flask B.
Change the transfer mode to realistic transfer.
Move the Graduated Cylinder B aside.
Click on Flask B, observe the pH on the pH meter.
Here is a table which shows results of our experiment.
pH of 0.1 Molar Hydrocholric acid is 1. When diluted, acidity decreases.
Similarly, pH of 0.1 Molar Sodium Hydroxide  is 13. When diluted, alkalinity decreases.
Hence, after dilution, pH was found to be 12.
Back to the workbench.
Click on Workbench 2.
Let us study the variation in pH by common ion effect.
We will demonstrate this, using weak acids and weak bases.
For this demonstration , we will use two examples-
Back to workbench.
From Stockroom explorer, double-click on Weak-acids cabinet.
A list of weak acid solutions with various strengths opens.
Again from Stockroom explorer, double-click on Weak-bases cabinet.
Double-click to choose 1 molar Ammonia solution.
Double-click on Conjugate-acids cabinet.
Double-click on 1 molar Ammonium Chloride solution.
Double-click on Conjugate-bases cabinet.
Next, click on new glassware icon. Select 250 ml Beaker.
We need 4 Beakers for this experiment.
Label the beakers as A, B, C and D.
Place the Beakers A and B to one side of the workbench.
Place the Beakers C and D on other side of the workbench.
Place Ethanoic acid and its conjugate base, Sodium Ethanoate on one side.
Place Ammonia and its conjugate acid Ammonium Chloride on the other side.
Transfer 25 ml of Ethanoic acid in beakers A and B using Precise transfer mode.
Click on pour.
Move the flask aside.
Transfer 25 ml of Ammonia solution into beakers C and D.
Move the flask aside.
To demonstrate the effect of common ion- Transfer 25 ml of Sodium ethanoate into beaker B.
Place 1 molar Sodium ethanoate flask over beaker B.
Type 25 in the transfer amount input bar.
To check the pH of 1M Ethanoic acid present in beaker A, click on beaker A.
Click on beaker B. pH meter shows  value of 4.76 .
Now transfer 25 ml of Ammonium Chloride into beaker D.
Type 25 in the transfer amount input bar.
To check the pH of 1molar Ammonia present in beaker C, click on beaker C.
pH meter shows pH value of 11.62.
Click on beaker D. pH meter shows pH value of 9.25.
Due to the presence of common ion that is ethanoate ion, ionization of ethanoic acid decreases.
Similarly, due to the presence of ammonium ion, ionization of Ammonia decreases.
Variation in pH by common-ion effect for ethanoic acid and ammonia solutions.
As an assignment: Measure change in pH for-  1 Molar and 0.01 Molar Sulphuric acid.
1 Molar and 0.01 Molar Sodium hydroxide.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on More on sed.
In this tutorial, we will learn some more on 'sed' commands through some examples.
You should be aware of sed tool.
The major use of sed is substitution.
Replacing some pattern in the input with something else.
Let's first look at the original file seddemo.txt.
Notice that the word Kumar occurs two times in the fourth line and once in the sixth line.
If you want to replace all occurrences of ‘Kumar’ with ‘Roy’,
type on the terminal:
sed space within single quote 's front slash / opening square bracket small k capital K   closing square bracket umar  slash Roy slash' after the single quotes space seddemo.txt.
Notice the fourth line.
Only the first occurrence of Kumar is changed to Roy, not the second one.
Sixth line had one occurrence of the word Kumar and this is replaced now.
So, we see only the first entry of the lines has been changed.
This is because, by default, the first matched entry of any line is substituted.
To substitute all the matched entries, we need to use the flag  g option.
Type:  sed space within single quotes 's front slash opening square bracket small k capital K closing square bracket umar slash Roy slash g' after the single quote space seddemo.txt press Enter.
Now, both entries of the fourth line are replaced.
We can make multiple substitutions in one go as well.
Say, we want to replace the word  "electronics" with the word "electrical"
and "civil" with "metallurgy" in the file seddemo.txt.
Type:  sed space hyphen e space within single quotes s front slash electronics slash electrical slash g  after the single quote space hyphen e space within single quotes  s front slash civil slash metallurgy slash g after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
You can see that the words are replaced.
Now we want to change the stream of "Anirban" from "computers" to "mathematics".
In such case, we would need to type:
sed space within single quotes 'front slash Anirban slash s slash computers slash mathematics slash g'  after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
We see that the stream is changed.
Let us understand what this is.
First we write sed, then in single quotes we write the pattern to be matched.
This is "Anirban".
Now after the slash comes the operation.
This is s that stands for substitution as we have already seen.
Then we mention the pattern to be replaced which is "computers".
Then the new word that would be substituted which is "mathematics".
We can also use sed to add or delete lines in the file.
Say, we want to select those lines which do not have stream as "electronics".
For that, we have the d flag.
Type:  sed space within single quotes front slash electronics slash d after the single quotes space seddemo.txt space greater than sign space nonelectronics.txt
To see the contents, type: cat space nonelectronics.txt.
Say, at the start of the file we want to add a line Student Information.
For that we have the i action.
We need to type: sed space in single quotes '1i space Student Information' after the quote seddemo.txt
You can see the output.
In fact, we can enter multiple lines like this.
Say, we want to add the two lines we would do it in a similar way.
Along with Student Information we also want to add academics in the next year.
So, in that case, we would write  sed space in single quotes 1i space Student Information backslash n 2013' after the quotes seddemo.txt.
Notice backslash n between the string ‘Information’ and ‘2013’.
backslash n prints 2013 in the next line after ‘Student Information’.
In this tutorial, we learnt:
Substitution Replacement and Insertion.
As an assignment, use the same text file seddemo.txt
and try to replace or substitute name Ankit with Ashish.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Compose Options for Emails.
about the email recipients, namely- To, Cc, Bcc.
Format the email text
Attach files to emails
Share files via Google Drive
Insert a photo or link into an email
and about  the Compose window options.
For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection
and a Web browser.
For this demonstration, I will be using Firefox web browser.
Let's begin.Open your web browser and type:
The Login page opens.
Enter a username and password in the respective text boxes.
If the Login page opens with the username, this means that you have already accessed this account from your machine.
Enter the password
and click on Sign in button.
We are in our Gmail page.
Now, let us look at the options available for writing an email.
So, first let us click on the Compose button.
The Compose window opens up.
The To segment is where we specify the recipients.
It has 3 options, To, Cc and Bcc.
Cc stands for Carbon Copy and Bcc stands for Blind Carbon Copy.
We have to add the email address of the person to whom we are sending the email in the To field.
Here’s a screenshot.
If we want to send the same email to more than 1 person, simply add the email-ids in the field To.
Here’s a screenshot.
Use Cc option to mark a copy of the email to others.
All the recipients marked in To and Cc fields can see all the other recipients.
Here’s a screenshot.
We can also use Bcc option to mark a blind copy of the email to others.
In this option, the recipients in To and Cc cannot see the recipients added in the Bcc.
The recipient in the Bcc can see the To and Cc recipients
but not the other Bcc recipients.
The sender of the mail can see the complete recipients list.
Here’s a screenshot.
Important Note:
We can add any number of email-ids in the recipients field - To, Cc and Bcc.
But the maximum limit is 500 recipients per day.
Each mail-id has to be separated by a space or comma or colon.
Let us now switch back to our Gmail Compose window.
By default, the cursor is in the To field.
Let's enter the recipient addresses as follows-
In To field, let's give the email-id as "ray.becky.0808@gmail.com".
In Cc field, "0808iambecky@gmail.com".
In Bcc field, "stlibreoffice@gmail.com" and "info@spoken-tutorial.org".
Click in the Subject line and enter a short description for your email.
I will type: Partner with us".
In the contents area, let us type the message:
Spoken Tutorial Project is helping to bridge the digital divide.
Gmail allows us to do basic formatting to the text in the body of our email.
It is displayed, by default, at the bottom of the Compose window.
If not, to access the formatting toolbar, click the Formatting options button.
Here, we have options such as different Font, Size, Bold, Italic, Underline, Text color, Align, Numbered and Bulleted lists and Indentation.
These options are exactly like the ones in any word processor application.
You may explore these options by yourself.
This is how I have formatted my text.
To hide the formatting toolbar, click the Formatting options button.
In the Compose window, there are options for attaching files, photos, links and emoticons.
To share files or documents with others,
we can use Attach files or Insert files using Drive" options.
All Mail providers allow to send files as attachment.
You can attach up to 25 megabytes (MB) in size.
To send files that are larger than this, you can use Insert files using Drive option.
Let us first attach a 'pdf file' which is less than 1Mb in size.
Click on the Attach file icon which looks like a paper clip.
This will open the file browser.
Browse and select the file you want to send via mail.
From the Desktop, I will select "myscript.pdf" and click on Open.
We can see that our file is getting attached to our mail.
Multiple files can also be attached to the same mail by using Attach files option.
To remove a file you've attached to a message, click on the 'x' mark to the right of the filename.
Now, let us attach a file which is around 30Mb.
I have a zip file on my Desktop which is around 30Mb file size.
Click the Attach files icon once again.
Browse and select the 30Mb zip file and click on Open.
We will get the popup message:
"The file you are trying to send exceeds the 25mb attachment limit".
And it gives us the option to Send using Google drive.
Click on Send using google drive button.
Let me close this for a moment.
Clicking on Insert files using Drive option also gets us to the same window as before.
Here, we can see 3 tabs:
My Drive, Shared with me and Upload."
By default, the files which are already uploaded, will be available under My Drive tab.
Here you can see a file.
This was shared by Google Team at the time of account creation.
Let’s click on Shared with me tab.
Here we see the message- "No one's shared any files with you yet!"
If anyone shares a file with you, it will be available under Shared with Me tab.
Now, click on Upload tab to upload a new file.
Click on Select files from your computer button.
Browse and select the file, from your machine, that you want to upload and click on Open .
Click on Add more files button, if you want to add any more files.
I will skip this for now and proceed with the single file upload only.
After the file has been added, we have to mention how it has to be inserted in our mail.
Notice 2 buttons at the bottom right which say-
Insert as Drive link and
Attachment.
By default, Insert as Drive link is selected.
If we select Attachment then the file will be inserted as an attachment.
We will leave it as it is.
Click on the Upload button at the bottom left corner of the screen.
It will start uploading but this may take some time depending on your internet speed.
Once complete, here, in the content area, we can see a link to the uploaded file.
Now let’s click on Insert Photo option to insert images in the email.
The Upload Photos window opens.
We can upload photos from our computer or by giving the website address of the image.
For now, I don't want to upload any image.
So, I will click on Cancel button.
You may explore this option on your own.
The next option is Insert Link. Let’s click on it.
The Edit Link dialog-box opens.
In the Text to display field, type the text that you want as the link.
I will type Spoken Tutorial.
In the Link to section, by default, the Web address option is selected.
In the text field, type the url as
and click on OK button.
Now, in the content area, you can see the text Spoken Tutorial and it is hyperlinked.
Let me click on the hyperlinked text.
A small pop window opens below the text.
It says- Go to link:.
Clicking on the URL displayed, will take you to the Spoken Tutorial website’s Homepage.
To change the URL or remove the link, we can click on Change or Remove options respectively.
We can also insert various pictorial representations with the help of this emoticon icon.
Use this feature in your email communication wherever required.
Notice the text Saved just before the Trash icon.

Plain text mode option will clear all the formatting we did before and convert the mail to plain text.
Print option will send the composed mail to the default configured printer.
Check Spelling will do spell-check of the typed content.
We are now ready to send our mail.
Click on Send button.
We get the following message on the screen-
This Drive file isn't shared with all recipients.
This is because we did not share the file with the people who are marked on this email."
Click on Share & Send button.
On the screen, we will see either of the two messages:
Your message is "sending"
or "Your message has been sent".
To view the sent mail, click on View Message link.
We can see the contents of the email which we sent here.
Let us cross-check one-by-one.
Here are the attachments
and here is the URL link.
Below the mail address, there is an inverted triangle that shows the header details.
Let me click on it.
We can see the email-ids of all the recipients in To, Cc and Bcc fields.
Let us see how the email will appear to the recipients.
This is the mail-id of the recipient marked in Cc.
You can see the message which is sent now. Let me open this to read.
Click on Show Details.
It displays To and Cc but not the Bcc recipients.
This is the mail-id of one of the recipient marked in Bcc.
You can see the message which is sent now.
Let me open this to read.
Click on Show Details.
You can see To, Cc and Bcc recipient details.
Let me come back to the sender’s gmail account.
Look over here, we mentioned 2 recipients in the Bcc.
But here we can see only one email id. The other one is not visible.
This is how the Bcc feature works.
Hope you are able to understand the differences clearly.

Let me try this.
This looks good here.
The Background, the original image which is not really needed any more, the Land layer, a Land copy and the Sky with the layer mask.
So let's decide here.
let me put this in.
Lets look at this.
I think I have over-done a bit with the brightening here.
But I will mask that out.

Welcome to this tutorial on Data manipulation using dplyr package.
In this tutorial, we will learn about,
Data manipulation
dplyr package
How to use filter and arrange functions
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Basics of Statistics
Basics of ggplot2 package
Data frames
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on,
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A data frame moviesData.csv
And A script file myVis.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to DataVis folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set DataVis folder as my Working Directory.
In real life, it is rare that we get the data in exactly the right form we need.
Often we’ll need to
create some new variables or summaries
rename the variables
reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with.
We will learn how to achieve all this by using dplyr package.
dplyr is a package for data manipulation, written and maintained by Hadley Wickham.
It comprises many functions that perform mostly used data manipulation operations.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myVis.R in RStudio.
Let us run this script by clicking on the Source button.
movies data frame opens in the Source window.
This data frame will be used later in this tutorial.
Now, we will install dplyr package. Please make sure that you are connected to the Internet.
In the Console window, type the following command and press Enter.
The installation of the package takes a few seconds.
We will wait while the package is being installed.
To load this package, we will add the library at the top of the script.
Click on the script myVis.R
At the top of the script, type library and dplyr in parentheses.
Save the script and run this line by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
Now we learn about some key functions in dplyr package:
filter- to select cases based on their values.
arrange - to reorder the cases.
select - to select variables based on their names.
mutate - to add new variables that are functions of existing variables.
summarise - to condense multiple values to a single value.
All these functions can be combined with group underscore by function.
It allows us to perform any operation by a group.
Let us switch to RStudio.
In the Source window, click on movies.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
This will enable us to see the remaining objects of movies data frame.
Suppose we want to filter the movies having genre as Comedy.
For this, we will use the filter function.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Recall that, filter function in dplyr package allows us to select cases based on their values.
Inside the filter function, the first argument is the name of the data frame which is movies.
The second argument is the value by which we want to filter the movies data frame.
Save the script and run the current line.
Resulting data frame is stored in an object called moviesComedy in the Environment window.
Let us view the data frame moviesComedy to check whether it contains movies with genre as Comedy.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the current line.
moviesComedy data frame opens in the Source window.
All the movies having genre as Comedy have been filtered.
Let us close this data frame moviesComedy for now.
We can also use logical operators to combine two or more than two values.
In the Source window, click on movies.
Suppose we want to filter the movies with genre as either Comedy or Drama.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Here, we have two values by which we would like to filter movies data frame.
For this, we have used a logical OR operator.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesComDr opens in the Source window.
The movies having genre as either Comedy or Drama have been filtered.
Let us close this data frame moviesComDr for now.
This filter function can also be written using the match operator.
In the Source window, type the following command.
%in% is used for value matching.
To know more about this operator, let us access the Help.
In the Console window, type the following command and press Enter.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesComDrP opens in the Source window.
The movies having genre as either Comedy or Drama have been filtered.
Let us close this data frame moviesComDrP for now.
In the Source window, click on movies.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
Let us now filter movies with genre as Comedy and imdb underscore rating greater than or equal to 7 point 5.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have used a logical AND operator to include both conditions.
Save the script and run the last two lines of code.
moviesComIm opens in the Source window.
I will resize the Console window.
There are seven movies with genre as Comedy and imdb underscore rating greater than or equal to 7 point 5.
Let us close this data frame moviesComIm for now.
In the Source window, click on movies.
Suppose, we want to arrange the movies in an ascending order of imdb underscore rating.
For this, we will use the arrange function.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesImA opens in the Source window.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right and locate the imdb underscore rating column.
The movies have been arranged in ascending order of imdb  rating.
Now, let us say we want to arrange the movies in descending order of imdb rating.
For this, we use desc function.
Let us close this data frame moviesImA for now.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesImD opens in the Source window.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right and locate the imdb underscore rating column.
The movies have been arranged in descending order of imdb rating.
Let us close this data frame moviesImD for now.
In the Source window, click on movies.
Suppose we want to arrange the movies both by genre and imdb rating.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesGeIm opens in the Source window.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
Movies have been arranged both by genre and imdb  rating.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
Data manipulation
dplyr package
How to use filter and arrange functions.
We now suggest an assignment.
Consider the built-in data set mtcars. Find the cars with hp greater than 100 and cyl equal to 3.

Dear Friends, Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Solving System of Linear Equations using Gauss Elimination and Gauss-Jordan Methods.
Solve system of linear equations using Scilab
with Scilab 5.3.3 version.
and should know how to solve Linear Equations.
A system of linear equations is a
finite collection of linear equations of the same set of  variables.
Let us study  Gauss elimination method.
Given a system of equations
A x equal to b
with m equations and
n unknowns.
We write the coefficients of the variables a one to a n
along with the constants b one to  b m  of the system of equations
in one matrix called the augmented matrix.
How do we convert the augmented matrix to an upper triangular form matrix?
We do so by performing row wise manipulation of the matrix.
Let us solve this system of equations using Gaussian elimination method.
Before we solve the system, let us go through the code for Gaussian elimination method.
The first line of the code is format e comma twenty.
This defines how many digits should be displayed in the answer.
The letter 'e' within single quotes denotes that the answer should be displayed in scientific notation.
The number twenty is the number of digits that should be displayed.
The command funcprot is used to let Scilab know what to do when variables are redefined.
The argument zero specifies that Scilab need not do anything if the variables are redefined.
Other arguments are used to issue warnings or errors if the variables are redefined.
Next we use the input function.
It will display a message to the user and get the values of A and b matrices.
The message should be placed within double quotes.
The matrices that the user enters, will be stored in the variables A and b.
Here A is the coefficient matrix and b is the right-hand-side matrix or the constants matrix.
Then we define the function naive gaussian elimination.
And we state that A and b are the arguments of the function naive gaussian elimination.
We store the output in variable x.
Then we find the size of matrices  A and b using the  size command.
Since they are two dimensional matrices, we use n and n one to store the size of matrix A.
Similarly we can use m one and p for matrix b.
Then we have to determine if the matrices are compatible with each other and
if A is a square matrix.
If n and n one are not equal then we display a message that Matrix A must be square.
If n and m one are not equal, we display a message
incompatible dimension of A and b.
If the matrices are compatible, we place matrices A and b in one matrix, C.
This matrix C is called augmented matrix.
The next block of code performs forward elimination.
This code converts the augmented matrix to upper triangular matrix form.
Finally, we perform back substitution.
Once the upper triangular matrix is obtained, we take the last row and find the value of the variable in that row.
Then once one variable is solved, we take this variable to solve the other variables.
Thus the system of linear equations is solved.
Let us save and execute the file.
Switch to Scilab console to solve the example.
On the console, we have a prompt to enter the value of the coefficient matrix.
So we enter the values of matrix A.
Type: square bracket three point four one space one point two three space minus one point zero nine semi colon
two point seven one space two point one four space one point two nine semi colon
one point eight nine space minus one point nine one space minus one point eight nine close square bracket.
Press Enter.  The next prompt is for matrix b.
So we type  open square bracket four point seven two semi colon three point one semi colon two point nine one close square bracket.
Then we call the function by typing
naive gaussian elimination open parenthesis A comma b close parenthesis
The solution to the system of linear equations is shown on Scilab console.
Next we shall study the Gauss-Jordan method.
In Gauss–Jordan Method,
the first step is to form the augmented matrix.
To do this, place the coefficient matrix A and the right hand side matrix b together in one matrix.
Then we perform row operations to convert matrix A to diagonal form.
In diagonal form, only the elements a i i  are non-zero. Rest of the elements are zero.
Then we divide the diagonal element and corresponding element of right hand side element, by the diagonal element.
We do this to get diagonal element equal to one.
The resulting value of the elements of each row of the right hand side matrix gives the value of each variable.
Let us solve this example using Gauss-Jordan Method.
Let us look at the code first.
The first line of the code uses format function to specify the format of the displayed answers.
The parameter e specifies the answer should be in scientific notation.
Twenty (20) denotes that only twenty digits should be displayed.
Then we get the A and b matrix using the input function.
We define the function Gauss Jordan Elimination with input arguments A and b and output argument x.
We get the size of matrix A and store it in m and n.
Similarly, we get the size of matrix b and store it in r and s.
If the sizes of A and b are not compatible, we display an error on the console using error function.
Then we perform row operations to get diagonal form of the matrix.
Here pivot refers to the first non-zero element of a column.
Then we create a matrix of zeros called x with m rows and s columns.
Once we have the diagonal form,
we divide the right hand side part of augmented matrix  by the corresponding diagonal element to get the value of each variable.
We store the value of each variable in x.
Then we return the value of x.
Now let us save and execute the function.
The prompt requires us to enter the value of matrix A.
So we type open square bracket zero point seven comma one seven two five semi colon
zero point four three five two comma minus five point four three three close square bracket.
The next prompt is for vector b.
So we type open square bracket one seven three nine semi colon
three point two seven one close square bracket.
Then we call the function by typing
Gauss Jordan Elimination open parenthesis A comma b close parenthesis
The values of x one and x two are shown on the console.
Let us summarize this tutorial.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Analog to Digital Conversion using Arduino.
In this tutorial, we will learn about :  ADC i.e. Analog to Digital Conversion
ADC pins in Arduino
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter
To follow this tutorial, you should have a basic knowledge of:
Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS
We require few external components such as
Breadboard and  Jumper wires
In this tutorial, we will detect the temperature and humidity using DHT11 sensor.
This sensor collects analog values and gives it to Arduino Uno.
Arduino ADC pins will convert these analog values to digital values.
Next, we will understand the concept of resolution.
Arduino Uno has 10-bit resolution.
This means, it can detect (2 to the power of 10) i.e. 1024 discrete analog levels.
Resolution is the smallest change that can be measured
Arduino gives 5 Volts output voltage, so 5 Volts divided by 1024 levels gives 4.89 miliVolts.
That means, Arduino Uno can be sensitive to a minimal change of 4.8 9miliVolts.
This shows the circuit connection for DHT11 with Arduino.
Arduino Uno has 6 in-built ADC channels (A0 to A5).
ADC channels read analog signal in the range of 0-5 Volts.
Pin 1 of the DHT11 sensor is connected to 5 Volts pin of Arduino.
Pin 2 of the DHT11 sensor is the Data pin.
This Data pin of the sensor is connected to analog pin A0 of Arduino.
Pin 3 of the DHT11 sensor is connected to the ground pin of the Arduino.
This is the live setup of the connection, as shown in the circuit diagram.
Now we will write the program in Arduino IDE.
Open Arduino IDE.
First we need to download the DHT11 arduino library to run this program.
Click on Sketch menu in the menu bar.
Select Include Library and then click on Manage Libraries option.
A new window will appear.
In the top right corner, we can see a search tab.
We can see various libraries for DHT11 sensor.
Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and select SimpleDHT by Winlin.
In the version drop down box, we can select the latest version of the library.
Click on Install button to install the library.
The DHT11 library is now installed in the Arduino IDE.
Click on the Close button at the right bottom of the window.
Let us add this library to the program.
Click on the Sketch menu and select Include Library.
Newly downloaded library usually appear at the end.
So scroll down to the bottom of the list and select SimpleDHT.
We can see the header file SimpleDHT.h added in the code window.
Here we have initialized the data pin of DHT11 sensor which is connected to A0.
This command creates a DHT object.
Inside void setup function, type the code as shown:
Serial.begin() function initiate the serial communication.
It sets the data rate in bits per second for serial data transmission.
9600 represents the baud rate.
delay(500) is the delay time for the sensor to boot.
Serial.print command prints the header as specified here.
Now we will write the code for void loop.
We have created two variables, temperature and humidity for DHT sensor output.
dht11.read, reads the data from the sensor.
It stores the result in microcontroller’s register.
These lines prints the temperature in degree Celsius and humidity in percentage.
delay(2000) updates the current humidity and temperature readings every 2 seconds.
This code is available in the Code files link of this tutorial.
A pop up window will appear to save the current program.
Now click on upload button to upload the current program on Arduino.
We will see the output in the Serial monitor screen.
For this, click on the Tools menu and select Serial monitor.
The serial monitor window opens.
Temperature and humidity of the current place is displayed as expected.
Next we will see the output in the serial plotter.
Let us modify the program.
Comment the line Serial.print( “Temperature & Humidity :”); as shown.
This will not print the text Temperature and Humidity.
For plotting, we require only the values of temperature and humidity.
Let us upload the current program to see the results on serial plotter.
Click on the tools menu and select serial plotter.
We can see two lines simultaneously plotting the points.
The blue line indicates the temperature which is around 28 to 30 °C.
The red line is the humidity reading which is near to 45%.
The readings will vary depending upon where the experiment is done.
Now cover the sensor with your hands and you will see the fluctuating readings.
Close the window.
It is useful for humidity readings between 20% to 80% with ∓5% RH i.e. (Relative Humidity)
It is useful for temperature readings between 0 to 50 °C with ∓2 °C
ADC pins in Arduino
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
Modify the above existing code.
Add 1 or 2 °C to the temperature value that you get on the serial monitor.
To increase the temperature reading, cover the DHT11 sensor with your hands.

Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
This is Priya from IIT Bombay signing off.
Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on DOCTYPE and Head section in HTML.
The tags inside the Head section in HTML
To practice this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of HTML.
If not, then go through the corresponding tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
gedit Text Editor and  Firefox web browser
However, you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Every HTML document must begin with the DOCTYPE declaration.
DOCTYPE tells the browser about the type of the document we are using.
This is the syntax
For HTML5 we have to type DOCTYPE html
The word DOCTYPE has to be written in capital letters.
Let us have a look at this.
I have already opened the html file Mypage.html in a text editor.
Notice the 1st line of this document.
We have declared the DOCTYPE as html.
Now open this file in a web browser.
I have opened this in a Firefox web browser.
The browser displays the formatted content inside the body tag.
But not the information about the page.
Go to the Tools menu in the top.
A Page Info dialog box opens with the information about the page.
In the General tab, notice in the Type field, it says text/html.
Note: This Page Info option is available only in Firefox web browser.
This is not available in Google Chrome web browser.
Close the Page Info dialog box.
Next let us learn about the tags inside the Head section.
Inside the Head section we can use the following tags:
Title,  Style,  Meta
Link,  Script,  Base
We will learn them one by one.
Switch to the text editor.
I have updated the Head section with a few tags.
Pause the video and update your code as shown here.
Now, let us go through them one by one.
We can set the title for a page with the help of title tag.
Using the Style tag we can set the styles for the elements.
We can link other files like css, javascript, html in our file using the link tag.
With this, we can incorporate the linked file properties into our current file.
But we cannot create a clickable link using this tag like an anchor tag.
Using the script tag, we can write some scripts like javascript, to perform some action.
Here I have written a simple script.
It is not mandatory to write the script tag inside the Head section.
We can also write it elsewhere in the body section.
Using the Meta tag, we can provide metadata like Author, Description and Keywords for the page.
This will be helpful when we search this page using a search engine.
Here I have provided the Author information and the Keywords for this page.
We can define the base URL for the page using the base tag.
Let us save the code now.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
On doing so, we get a pop-up with the message - “Welcome to Spoken Tutorial”.
This means that the script tag has executed successfully.
Click on the OK button to close this pop-up.
In the browser’s tab, notice the text “Farmer’s market”.
We have mentioned this inside the title tag.
Also notice that our page has an Aquamarine background color.
But note that in the code of Mypage.html, I haven’t set any colour for the background.
So, how did the background of the page get set to Aquamarine?
This is because I have linked mystyle.css file using the link tag in Mypage.html file.
Let’s open the file mystyle.css in a text editor.
Here in mystyle.css file, I have set the background colour to Aquamarine.
And I have also set the text align as left for the body tag.
Therefore these style properties get incorporated in the HTML file.
That is why the background of the page is set to Aquamarine .
Notice that some lines appear in red color in the browser window.
This is because, inside the style tag we have set the text color for the paragraph tag to red.
We have also given some metadata information in the code.
As I mentioned earlier, this information is useful when we search a page in a search engine.
In the Firefox browser window, let us once again go to the Tools menu at the top.
The Page Info dialog box opens.
In the General tab, notice the meta information.
Here, we can see the meta information of Author and Keywords which we gave in the code.
Let’s close the Page Info dialog box.
Next let us see what a base tag does.
A website may have multiple sub-pages like-
The address for these will appear as shown.
In this case, the base URL mysite.com will be common.
We can use the base tag to define the base URL for the site or its content.
This is the syntax
And here is an example
Meta,  Link,  Script and  Base tags in HTML.
Create an alert with the message, “Welcome to My page”.
Add the author information and keywords to your page.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create a database using pgAdmin.
In this tutorial, we will learn about how to:
database and its objects,
Table and its attributes and
To record this  tutorial, I am using:
PostgreSQL 9.3.x and
To follow this tutorial, you should have good understanding of basic computer concepts and
Let us open the pgAdmin.
Click Dash Home on the top left corner of the computer desktop.
In the Search box, type: pgAdmin. The pgAdmin icon appears. Click on it.
The pgAdmin interface is opened now.
Here, on the left hand side, we can see the object browser pane.
The various objects of the database are displayed here.
The upper right pane shows the relevant properties of each object.
The lower right pane is the SQL pane where the script of the currently selected object is displayed.
Let us see how to connect to the server.
Click on the connection icon on the top left corner of the tool bar.
New Server Registration window appears.
In the Properties tab, enter localhost in the Name field and localhost in the Host field.
The database name, and the Username which are shown here are the names given during installation.
Enter the password which you gave during installation.
Small pop-up windows will appear from time to time.
Always click on this check-box 'Do not show this hint again', before you close these windows.
Click on Ok button.
Here, we can see the connection established to localhost.
We can see several objects for this particular server.
Now, click on the Databases node.
Database is a collection of information or data which is stored in an organized way.
A database has objects such as tables, views, procedures, functions etc.
We will learn about these objects in the future tutorials, in this series.
We can have multiple databases depending upon our application requirement.
Switch back to pgAdmin interface.
Now, we will create a new database for our demonstration purpose.
Right-click on the Databases node and select New Database.
Type Sampledb as the database name and click Ok.
Now, we can see the database is listed under the database node, which we created just now.
Next, we will add a student table to this sampledb database.
What is table? In RDBMS, we store data in database objects called tables.
A table is a collection of related data that is stored in rows and columns format.
This is an example of a STUDENT table.
The fields in the STUDENT table are Student ID, student name, address, city, Phone, Date of birth, CGPA etc.
A column is a set of value of a particular data type. This is also called as attribute.
Here, in the STUDENT table, Student Name is one of the attribute that represents names of students.
Now switch back to the interface.
To create a new table in Sampledb database, click on the Sampledb node.
Right-click on the table node and select New Table.
Click on the Columns tab to enter the columns for this table.
In the new window that opens, enter Student name in the Name field.
Select character varying as data type from the drop-down list box.
The data type specifies what type of data the field can hold.
Enter 50 as the length of the field.
The length specifies the maximum length of the column of the table.
Click Ok button to add column to the table.
We will see what are the common data types used in PostgreSQL.
Integer, numeric represents numeric data type.
For example: phone no, age, quantity are of numeric data type.
numeric(n,d) - is also numeric data type with decimal places.
Here n is the total digits and d is the number of digits after the decimal.
It can be used to represent fields like basic salary, unit price etc.
char and character varying represents string data type.
Fields such as name, address, email are of string data type.
Date represents date data type.
Likewise, I'll add City column with character varying data type and length as 40.
Add the column Gender as shown.
Add a Date of Birth column with date data type.
Next, add a CGPA field. Select the data type as numeric.
Enter 2 as length and 1 as precision. This is same as the decimal data type.
We have entered all the columns for the student table.  Click on Ok button.
A window shows some message about Primary keys.
We can see the student table is created in the sampledb database.
In the SQL pane, we can see the syntax of the create table command generated automatically.
In this tutorial, we have learnt -  how to connect to the server,
How to create a database,
As an Assignment, connect to the server and check the default available database.
Create a new database Organization.  In the Organization database, create a table Emp with the columns Emp name, Address, Date of Birth and Salary.

The main motivation of this is to give you a head start about working with Linux.
The first command that we will see is the echo command. However note that Linux commands are 'case sensitive'.
Ctrl Alt t helps to start a terminal in Ubuntu.
This command may not work in all Unix systems however.
This prints the customary 'Hello World' message on the screen.
We can also use the 'echo' command to display the value of a variable.
We can also use escape sequences with 'echo' command.
For this in Linux we need to use the -e (hyphen e) option.
Common escape sequences include \t (backslash t) for tab, \n for new line and \c is a escape sequence which when used causes the prompt to be displayed on the same line.
This can be useful if say we want a prompt message before entering something.  Type at the prompt:
We will see that the prompt will be displayed after printing ‘Enter a command ‘ on the same line.
To know this and many other characteristics of our machine we have the uname command. Type at the prompt: uname space hyphen r and press Enter .
To know what is your username, type at the prompt: who space am space I and press Enter.
This in fact comes from the who command that enlists all the users currently logged into the system in case your system is a multiuser system.
For this we have the passwd command. Type at the prompt:
When you type this command you would be asked to type the current password.
Here I would be typing my system's current password.
But what if we have forgotten our current password?
Then also the password can be changed without knowing the current password, but that can only be done by the root user.
Now who is a 'root user'?
He is a special person with extra privileges.
To draw an analogy we can say a 'root user' is similar to a user in Windows with Administrator status.
Type date in the terminal and press Enter
As we can see the date command gives both date and time. This is a very versatile utility and has many options as well.
Type at the prompt: date space plus 'percent' sign capital T and press Enter.
It gives us only the time in hours minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format.
Type at the prompt: date space plus 'percentage sign small h and press Enter.
Type at the prompt: date space plus percentage sign small m and press Enter.
It gives the month of the year in numerical format. Here it is showing 02 for the month of February . Match this according to the output you are getting.
Type at the prompt: date space plus percentage sign small y and press Enter .
We can combine these options as well. For example type at the prompt: date space plus within double quotes percentage small h percentage small y and press Enter .
Here it is showing  February 11.
To see the calendar of any arbitrary month say December 2070, type at the prompt: cal space 12 space 2070 and press Enter.
Before moving ahead let us discuss a little bit about files and directories.
In Linux almost everything is a file. Now the question is what is a file?
In real file a file is where we store our documents and papers. Similarly a Linux file is a container for storing information.
Next what is a directory?
When we login into the Linux system we are by default in a home directory. To see the home directory type at the prompt: echo space dollar HOME in capital and press Enter.
The next command helps us to see the directory we are currently working in. It is pwd that stands for 'present working directory'. Type at the prompt pwd and press Enter.
Once we know of our directory we would also want to know what are the files and sub-directories in that directory. For this, we have the ls command which is probably the most widely used command in Unix and Linux.
ls is a very versatile command and has many options. Let us see some of them, type at the prompt: ls  space  minus minus all and press Enter.
This shows all the files including the hidden files (hidden files here are filenames starting with dot (.))
If we not only want to see the file but also get more information we can use the 'minus l' option.
Just type the command: ls space minus small l and press Enter.
It gives us the file permissions, file owner's name, last modification time, file size in bytes etc. Explanation of the fields of this option is beyond the scope of the present tutorial.
ls can be used with many options which we will see later.
Just type the command followed by the right angle bracket and the file name. Say we write ls space minus small l space right angle bracket space fileinfo and press Enter.
Now all the files and directories information will be directed into the file named 'fileinfo'.
But how do we see the content of this file? For this, we have the cat command. Just type cat space and the name of the file, here it is fileinfo and press Enter.
Now you can see its contents. In fact, the other main use of cat is to create a file. For this, type at the prompt: cat space right angle bracket space filename say file1 and press Enter.
Now when we press Enter the command waits for input from the user.
Whatever we type would be written into the file so type some text.
Now press Enter key to indicate the end of input.
Now press the Ctrl and D keys together.
If a file by name say 'file1' already exists then the user input will be overwritten on this file.
Now if you wish to append to the end of an existing file ‘file1’ type at the prompt: cat space double right angle bracket space file1 and press Enter.
There are several other commands that we could have discussed but we would keep it to this for now. In fact, even for all the commands discussed there are many options and possibilities untouched here.
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the Talk to a Teacher project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Simple Machines.
In this tutorial we will learn to,
Simulate the working of a pulley system.
Calculate the necessary force to pull the load.
Achieve a balance condition for the lever.
Calculate the torque.
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with topics in basic physics.
First we will define a pulley.
A pulley is a simple machine that is used to lift heavy objects.
We can either use a single pulley or a combination of pulleys.
For example pulleys can be used in wells, escalators, rock climbing, flag poles and others.
Use the given link to download the Apps.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use, Pulley system and Lever Principle Apps.
After downloading, html5phen folder appears in the Downloads folder.
Double-click on html5phen folder.
We see two folders namely ph and phen.
Now double-click on the phen folder.
In this folder, we see the Apps in java script  and htm format.
We will use the Apps with htm file format.
To open the Pulley system app, press Ctrl+F keys  simultaneously.
In the search bar type Pulley system.
Right click on pulleysystem_en.htm  file.
Select the option Open With Firefox web Browser.
The App interface opens with two panels.
A yellow panel with a pulley system and
A green panel to change and display parameters.
In the yellow panel, notice that a load is attached to the pulley with the help of a rope.
We can either raise or lower the load using a Springscale.
Click and drag the mouse to raise or lower the load.
Observe that there is no change in the value on the right panel.
This is because the necessary force required to drag the load remains the same.
On the top of the green panel you can see a drop down list of pulleys.
The weight of the load is displayed in the white box.
The default weight of the load is 14 Newton.
We can change the value of the weight from 1 Newton to 40 Newton.
We can change the Weight of the loose pulley in this box.
This is the total weight of the 4 pulleys.
The Necessary force used to lift the load is calculated using the App.
At the bottom of the green panel we have Springscale and Force vectors radio buttons.
By default Springscale is selected.
Let us demonstrate the working of the pulley.
Observe that weight of 20 Newton is hanging from the 4 pulley sections of the rope.
Each section of the rope has one fourth of the total weight.
In the App force required to raise the weight in  air is calculated.
The Necessary force is calculated using  formula.
W
Now change the Weight of the loose pulley to 20 Newton.
Observe that the Necessary force is changed to  10 Newton.
Next change the weight of the load to 30 Newton.
observe that the weight of the loose pulley has changed to 10 Newton.
This is because the Springscale’s limit is 10 Newton.
Values more than 10 Newton are automatically changed.
As an assignment, Change the weight of the load to 25 Newton and weight of the loose pulley to 10 Newton.
Calculate the necessary force and verify your answer from the App.
Next we will move on to Lever Principle App.
To open Lever Principle App right-click on lever_en.htm  file and Open With Firefox Web Browser.
This App shows a symmetrical lever with some mass pieces.
Each mass piece weighs 1 Newton.
At the bottom of the interface Lever Principle  is defined.
A lever is in balance if the total left side torque is equal to the total right side torque.
Observe that the lever arm is shown by green and orange rectangles.
Length of each rectangle is 0.10 meter.
At the bottom left of the screen torque is calculated.
Torque is the twisting force that tends to cause a rotation.
The point where the object rotates is the axis of rotation.
In the App fulcrum is the axis of rotation.
We can calculate the torque using the formula.
Green and orange rectangles indicate perpendicular distances.
We can change the hanging weight by clicking and holding the mouse.
Observe that, the lever is unbalanced.
This is because torque on both the sides is not same.
Notice that the value of left side torque is reduced to 0.9 Nm
What happens when hanging weights are removed from both the sides.
Let us hang the weights at different distances to the left of the fulcrum.
Click and hold the mouse to add one weight on the third rectangle.
Add two weights on the fourth rectangle.
Observe that the lever is now unbalanced.
Let us add weights to the right side of the fulcrum to balance the lever.
Click and hold the mouse to add one weight to the first rectangle.
Continue to add weights to third, fourth and fifth rectangles.
Notice that the lever is now balanced.
As an assignment solve this numerical.
Let us summarize
In this tutorial we have,
Calculated the necessary force to pull the load.
Achieved a balance condition for the lever.
Calculated the torque.
These Apps are created by Walter-fendt and his team.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Array Functions in PERL.
In this tutorial, we will learn about array functions in PERL like:
push , pop , shift
unshift ,  split
splice and  join
sort, qw.
I am using  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 operating system and Perl 5.14.2.
You should have basic knowledge of  variables,  data Structures and arrays in PERL.
Knowledge of comments, loops  and  conditional statements will be an added advantage.
Please go through the relevant spoken tutorials on the spoken tutorial website.
Perl  provides certain inbuilt functions.
These functions can perform various operations on an array.
Let us first learn how to add and remove elements from the last position of an array.
This can be done by using
push function which adds an element at the last position of an array
and pop function which removes an element from the last position of an array.
Let us understand push and pop functions by using a sample program.
Open the terminal and type:  gedit perlArray dot pl space ampersand
This will open 'perlArray dot pl' file in gedit.
Type the code as shown on the screen.
Here, we have declared an array of length 3.
push function will insert an element at the last position of this array i.e after 3
whereas pop function will remove an element from the last position of the array.
In our case, 4 will be removed from the array.
push function takes 2 arguments-
1st argument to the push function is the array in which to add an element.
2nd argument is the element which is to be pushed into the array.
The syntax of pop function is as follows:
pop function takes only one argument.
It is the array from which an element needs to be removed.
Note: Both these functions work at the last position of an array.
The element removed by pop function can be collected into another variable.
The syntax for this is $variable space = space pop open bracket @myArray close bracket .
Now switch to the terminal and execute the Perl script.
Type: perl perlArray dot pl and press Enter.
The output is as shown on the terminal.
Now, let us see how to add/remove an element from the 1st position of an  array.
This can be achieved using-
unshift function which adds an element to an array at the 1st position.
shift function which removes the first element from an array.
Let us understand this using a sample program.
I will open perlArray dot pl file which I have already created.
unshift function will insert an element at the first position i.e before 1.
shift function will remove an  element from the first position.
In our case, zero will be removed.
The unshift function takes 2  arguments-
1st argument is the array in which to add an element,
2nd argument is the element to be added into the array .
shift function takes only one argument -
This is the array from which the element  needs to be removed.
Note: Both these functions work at first position of an array.
We can collect the element removed by shift function into some variable.
The syntax for this is: $variable space =  space shift open bracket @myArray close bracket.
Then switch to the terminal and execute the Perl script.
Type: perl perlArray dot pl and press Enter.
The output displayed on the terminal is as highlighted.
Now, let us see how to remove an  element from a specified position of an array.
splice function removes an  element from a specified position of an array.
The return value of this function is an array of removed elements.
Let us understand this using a sample program.
Go to the perlArray dot pl file which we created earlier.
Type the piece of code as shown on the screen.
We need to provide index  from where we want to remove the  elements and
the offset up to which we want to remove the elements.
In our case, the elements 5 and 6 will be removed.
Then switch to the terminal and execute the Perl script by typing:
perl perlArray dot pl and press Enter.
The output is as shown on the terminal.
Now, let us look at few other inbuilt functions of arrays.
split function is used to divide a string at a specified delimiter.
The return value of this function is an array.
The elements of this array are the divided portions of the string.
join function joins the elements of an array using the specified delimiter.
It returns a string of joined elements.
sort function sorts an array in alphabetical/numerical order.
qw function returns an array of words, separated by a white space.
Now, let us understand all these  functions using a sample program.
gedit arrayFunctions dot pl space ampersand and press Enter.
Type the following piece of code as shown on screen.
In this case, each word of the variable string will become an  element of an array.
Here, each element of newArray will be joined by comma.
sort function will sort the elements of  an array in alphabetical order.
qw function creates an array of words separated by space.
Let us understand each function.
split function takes two arguments.
1st argument  is the delimiter by which the  string needs to be split,
2nd is the string which needs to be split.
Delimiters can be specified in forward slash, single or double quotes.
join function takes 2 arguments.
1st is the delimiter by which the array elements need to be joined.
2nd is the array.
Delimiters  can be specified in single or double quotes.
sort function takes a single argument which is the array that needs to be sorted.
qw function returns an array of words, separated by space.
It is not necessary to specify the word in quotes if written using qw.
Then switch to the terminal and execute the Perl script by typing:
perl arrayFunctions dot pl
The following output is displayed on the screen.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:
add/remove elements  from an array
basic functions which can be performed on array using sample program.
'script.spoken-tutorial.org/index.php/Perl'
Split the above string at '/ '  (forward slash) delimiter.
Add https:// at the start of a newly created array.
Remove element “Perl” from the array.
Declare a number array  and sort it.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on the Basic Function. This is one of the two tutorials on this topic.
In this tutorial, I'm going to take you through how to create your function, the syntax of it and how to input one or more than one value.
The other tutorial will be on returning values.
So, let us just start with this. I am creating my PHP tags here. I'll start with my syntax which is function.
And then the function name which is myname.
It's probably easy to use common caps here which is why you have lower case, then going to upper case, back to lower case. Finally, the new words will start from upper cases.
It's much easier to read but I always prefer to use the small case.
Then you're going to have 2 parentheses, nothing inside them yet. We're not taking any input here. And inside I'll write my code; so I'll write "Alex".
Okay. If we run this now, we will see that nothing happens.
Because of that we've declared our function but we haven't called it yet.
Now, to call our function, we just need to write the name of the function, the 2 brackets and the line terminator.
If we are putting values through this that need to be processed, we'll put them in here.
But, for now don't worry about that. We're just calling out our function which will execute this block of code.
So, let's do a Refresh and there you go. "Alex" has been echoed down.
Now suppose, if I want to add more than one line of code, I can put as much code here as I want. That's what the block is there for, to accommodate for more new lines. Let's just test that.
We can see that it worked. Another thing to add is that it does not need to be called on it's own. It can be called, for example, "My name is" myname();.
All-right. We need to say "My name is " and then echo the function separately.
The reason this didn't work is probably because this is not a value. This is a function, so it's already going to echo "Alex".
So, for picking out a new line it'll be the same, saying echo "My name is", echo "Alex", okay?
So, this would not work if we had it here. For example, you would literally just have output "My name is myname(). Okay?
So, let's take this back down here. Refresh it and there you go, "My name is Alex".
Just to make sure that I'm hear. If I was to replace this with a code which was being executed, it would look like that.
So, we wouldn't do that, okay?
So, that was only to get clear on that. Now we'll move on to the fact that you can call a function before it's been defined. That is, because of the way PHP works. So if I say, refresh this, you'll expect this because the function is being called before it's been declared. That it would recognize it from top to bottom.
However, it doesn't work that way. You can declare it at the bottom of the page if you think that's best. I always prefer to declare at the top so that I can resume or back up to the top and see where I am.
But, that's about it. Now, putting a value in, what I'll do is I'll say "Your name is" $name.  That's echoing out "Your name is" and then the variable name. I'll name the function yourname().
Now, where's the variable going to come from? I want the user to be able to input this. I mean, I'm not talking about input but if I put the $name here and then I say yourname("Alex");
This is how it works. yourname calls the function, takes this variable into account, puts this variable into $name and then reads the variable from echo. This is what I mean.
So, we're basically saying 'your name Alex'. To proceed with, I need a value for this, particularly a string value. So you go up to here and see if anything has been entered as input. You see it has been. It's "Alex". So we should get "your name is Alex" now.
There we are! We can change this to "Billy". Thus you've seen how it works.
All-right. Now what I want to do is, I might want to add to my function to say that you are so and so years old. So, I can say that you are age years old.
What we need to say is name and age. Basically, what we do is add another variable.
Okay, so, we're adding an extra thing here, separated by a comma. Here we need to separate the variables by a comma. So, again it's taking this variable into account, putting it here and echoing it out here. Taking this variable into account, putting it in the call and echoing it out here.
This is basically the structure of your variable. How many variables it takes and this is how you code your function.
So, let's test that. Okay, you need a space out there. I can change this again to "Alex", 19 and Refresh. There you go.
So, functions are written to save time.  It takes large blocks of code. It can take an input. It will process it in such a way that it would be time consuming otherwise.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. For advanced functions like 'returning value', please check the other tutorials on functions.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Interfacing Arduino with Tricolor LED and Pushbutton.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: connect a tricolor LED to Arduino board,
write a program to blink tricolor LED and use Push button to control the blinking.
Here I am using: Arduino UNO Board,
Ubuntu Linux 14.04 operating system and  Arduino IDE.
To follow this tutorial, you should have:  basic knowledge of electronics and basic knowledge of C or C++ programming language.
We also require some external devices such as Tricolor LED,  Resistor,
Breadboard,  Jumper Wires and  Pushbutton.
Let us see the images of the external devices that are required for this experiment.
This is also called as Common Cathode Tricolor LED.
It has four pins. Cathode is the longest pin.
The remaining three pins are for the red, green and blue color LEDs.
Cathode pin is the ground pin common to the red, green and blue LEDs.
Resistor is an electrical component that limits the flow of current in an electronic circuit.
Resistors can also be used to provide a specific voltage for an active device.
This is the breadboard which is commonly used to build electronic circuits.
It has many holes. Electronic components are inserted into these holes and are connected using wires.
Jumper wires are short electrical wires with a solid tip at each end.
Jumper wires are used to interconnect the components in a breadboard.
Let us see the connection circuit details now.
This circuit is very simple. Cathode pin is connected to the ground pin in the Arduino board, using the black wire like this.
The red, green and blue pins are connected to pin numbers 12, 11 and 10 using resistors.
Why do we need resistors here? This is to control the voltage to the LEDs.
We need three current-limiting resistors for each color.
Let me show you the live demo.
This is the mini breadboard where I have connected the tricolor LED and resistors.
This is exactly what we have seen in the circuit diagram.
Now we have to write a program for this circuit to work.
Let us open the Arduino IDE.
We know that any Arduino program comes with two basic functions -
Void setup function is for setting up a microcontroller.
Here, we need to setup the pins that we are using in our experiment.
Now we will write the code for the Void setup function.
In the circuit diagram, notice that pin number 10 is connected to the blue LED.
In the Arduino IDE, type: pinMode open bracket 10 comma OUTPUT close bracket Semicolon.
Similarly, type the code for the other pins as shown:
Pin number 11 represents the green LED and 12 represents the red LED.
Next we will write the code for the Void loop function.
This code is the same as the one we wrote for the Blink LED program.
These four lines of code will blink the blue LED with a delay of 500 milliseconds.
Copy and paste the same code for the other pins.
Change the pin number to 11 for green LED and 12 for red LED.
Let us save this program.
Click File and Save.
Now the microcontroller is programmed to send alternate signals HIGH and LOW to pin 10, 11 and 12.
The next step is to compile and upload the program.
From the Sketch menu, click on Compile.
We can see the compilation status at the bottom of the IDE.
To upload the program to the microcontroller, click on the Sketch menu and then on Upload.
We can see that the red, blue and green LEDs are blinking.
The blinking is continuous.
Next, we will see how to interface a push button to the same circuit, to control the blinking.
Pushbutton is a component that connects two points in a circuit when you press it.
You can see a button on the top which can be pressed.
We are using the same circuit for this experiment with a pushbutton.
Pushbutton is also known as momentary switch. The moment you press it, the tricolor LED will glow.
If you release the switch, the tricolor LED will not work.
One leg of the Pushbutton is connected to 5 volts.
And the other leg is connected to pin number 4 which is shown here in yellow color wire.
Here, you can see a resistor connected to the pushbutton.
Why do we need a resistor here?
When the pushbutton is pressed, it connects the pin 4 to 5 volts and we read a HIGH.
At this point, the resistor helps to prevent the current from going to the ground pin.
If the pushbutton is not pressed, then also we need to pass some voltage.
The resistor which is connected through the ground pin will provide zero volt.
This will make microcontroller active as it receives some input.
Let us see our live video for the connection.
This is how the push button looks.
You can see the other connections exactly as I explained in the circuit diagram.
Now, let us modify our program for this circuit to work.
Switch back to Arduino IDE. This is our previous program.
I will add a new setup for the pin number 4.
Why should we give the mode as INPUT?
We have to write a conditional statement to check whether the switch is pressed or not.
In the void loop function, we will write the 'if' statement.
If pin number 4 receives an input, it will execute the code specified between the curly braces.
Let me reduce the delay to 100 milliseconds so that we can see the output quickly.
The coding is now done.
Let us compile and upload our program.
Next, we will press the pushbutton and see how it works.
We can see the tricolor LED is ON.
Press one more time. It works.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:  connect the tricolor LED to Arduino board,
write a program to blink tricolor LED
Do the following assignment.
If the button is pressed, keep the input as LOW.  Compile and upload the program.
Observe the blinking in the tricolor LED.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on working with Linux Processes.
I am using Linux Operating system.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website
Also note that Linux is case sensitive. All the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
To understand what a process is, let me give you a brief explanation.
Anything that is running in Linux is a process.
The shell that is running and taking our commands is a process.
The commands that we type on the terminal are processes when they are running.
The video in which you are seeing this tutorial is a process.
The browser running in which you have opened the spoken tutorial website is a process.
Shell scripts that are running are processes and so on.
A process can be defined as a program which is being executed i.e. which is running.
Processes are much like us. They are born, they die. They have parent and children.
Let us first learn about the shell process.
The shell process is started by the Linux kernel as soon as we login to the system.
At this point, it would suffice to know that the Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system.
It consists of the most essential components that make Linux run. The shell creates or gives birth to all the other user command processes.
Let us open a terminal.
We can see the command prompt on the terminal in the form of a dollar sign ($).
This is the job of the shell process.
Now, let us type any command, say date and press Enter.
As soon as we do this, the shell process will create a process called date.
Now, since the shell process has given birth to the 'date' process, we can say that the shell process is the parent of the 'date' process and the 'date' process is the child of the shell process.
Once date process has shown the system date and time, it will die.
A shell can also give birth to another shell process. Giving birth to a process or creating a process is also called spawning a process.
To spawn another shell process, simply go to the terminal and type “sh” and press Enter.
We would see a new prompt appearing in the terminal. Now our original shell, let us call it 'shell 1', has given birth to a child shell or sub shell; let us call it 'shell 2'.
Now, you may run a command in the new command prompt as well. Let us run 'ls' command in this new command prompt.
Now at the command prompt, type “ls” and press Enter. We can see a list of files and directories.
Now a new process named 'ls' is created.
Here, 'shell 2' is the parent of 'ls', while 'shell 1' is the grandparent of 'ls'. 'ls' is the child of 'shell 2', while 'shell 2' itself is the child of 'shell1'.
To kill 'shell 2', simply type at the new prompt “exit” and press Enter.
This will kill 'shell 2' and we will get back our original command prompt.
Continuing our analogy between us and processes, we know that each of us have some attributes that identify us. Those attributes can be our name, parents' name , date of birth, PAN card no. etc.
Similarly, processes also have attributes like PID(Process ID), PPID(Parent Process ID), Start time  etc.
Most of these attributes are maintained by the kernel in a process table.
Each process is uniquely identified by a unique integer called the 'PID'. 'PID' is allotted by the kernel when the process is born.
The 'PID' of the parent process that spawned a new process say 'P1' is called the 'PPID' of 'P1' process.
To see the PID of the current shell, at the prompt type: echo space dollar dollar and press Enter.
A number would be shown . This is the 'PID' of the current shell.
The one command that we would use a lot while talking about processes is the 'ps' command.
'ps' or process status is a command which displays the processes running in the system.
Let us see what happens if we run this command without any options.
Now, at the command prompt, type: “ps” and press Enter.
This way, we would normally see the list of all the processes owned by the user running the program.
You can see the name of the process under 'CMD' heading.
Other than this, you can see the PID, TTY or the console at which the process is running,
the TIME, that is the total processor time that has been used since the process started.
On my machine, it displays two processes.
One is the bash, the shell process we are using. The other is the 'ps' process itself.
The other important thing to note here is that the PID of the shell process is same as that shown by the echo space dollar dollar command.
If we spawn a sub-shell, let us see what happens. At the terminal, type “sh” and press Enter.
Now, in the new prompt that appears on the new line, type “ps” and press Enter.
Now we can see 3 processes in the list . The process 'sh' has been added.
Here, again notice that the PID of the bash process is same as that before.
'ps' comes with many options as we would see next. First option that we would see, displays more attributes for the processes listed.
Now, at the prompt, type: ps space minus f and press Enter. This again will list three processes as in the previous case.
Bash, sh and ps -f.
The only difference is now more attributes are listed.
'UID' gives the user name of the user who has started the process. Also, it shows the 'PPID' that is the 'PID' of the parent process that created the process.
For example, see that 'bash' process is the parent of 'sh' process; so the 'PID' of the 'bash' is same as the 'PPID' of 'sh' process.
Similarly, since 'sh' process is the parent of 'ps' process, the PID of 'sh' process is the same as the PPID of the ps -f process.
'C' stands for processor utilization. Currently, this is the integer value of the percent usage of the processor over the lifetime of the process.
It will be displayed as 0 (zero) in this case as the usage is negligible.
The STIME field gives the time at which the process started, the rest we have already seen while running 'ps'.
Processes are of two types : First one is User processes- those are started by the users.
For example 'ps' or for that reason most commands that we run on the terminal.
Second one is the system processes- those processes are started by the system, often during system startup or user login.
Example of system process can be bash.
Sometimes we may want to see all the processes, both- system processes as well as user processes.
Then we use the  'minus e'  or the 'minus capital A' option.
Go to the terminal and type at the prompt: ps space minus e and press Enter.
We can see a large list of processes.
To get a multi-page display, just type at the prompt:
ps space minus e space vertical bar space more and press Enter.
As we have seen before, more will cause only as many processes to be listed as can fit in one window.
As we press Enter, we scroll through the list of processes.
The first process in this list is interesting. It is called the init process.
It is the process from which almost all other processes are spawned.
It has a 'PID' of 1.
To come back to the prompt, press 'q'.
So, in this tutorial, we have learned about process, shell process, spawning of process, process attributes and different types of processes.
We also learned the use of 'ps' command. This brings me to the end of this tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Merging and Importing Data
Use built-in functions for exploring a data frame
Merge two data frames.
Import data in different formats in R
To understand this tutorial, you should know
Data frames in R
R script in RStudio
How to set working directory in RStudio
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on,
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version  1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use,
five data frames  in different formats and
a script file myDataSet.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded these files from Code files link and moved them to DataMerging folder in myProject folder on the Desktop.
I have also set this folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myDataSet.R in RStudio.
For this, click on the script myDataSet.R.
Script myDataSet.R opens in Rstudio.
Run this script by clicking on Source button.
captaincyOne appears in the Source window.
We will use some built-in functions of R to explore captaincyOne.
For all the built-in functions used in this tutorial, please refer to the Additional Material.
First, we will use summary function.
Click on the script myDataSet.R
In the Source window, type summary and then captaincyOne in parentheses.
Save the script and run the current line by pressing Ctrl+Enter keys simultaneously.
In the Console window, scroll up to locate the output.
Statistical parameters for each column of captaincyOne are shown on the Console.
In the Source window, press Enter.
Press Enter at the end of every command.
Now, let us look at class function.
In the Source window, type class and then captaincyOne in parentheses.
Save the script and run the current line.
class function returns the class of captaincyOne, which is data frame.
Next let us look at typeof function.
In the Source window, type typeof and then captaincyOne in parentheses.
Save the script and run the current line.
typeof function returns the storage type of captaincyOne, which is list.
To know more about typeof function, we will access the help section of RStudio.
In the Console window, type help, within parentheses typeof. Press Enter.
typeof determines the R internal type or storage mode of any object.
Click on the Files tab.
Clear the Console window by clicking on the broom icon.
Click on the data frame captaincyOne.
Now, let us extract two rows from top of captaincyOne.
For this, we will use head function.
Click on the script myDataSet.R
In the Source window, type head within parentheses captaincyOne comma space 2.
Save the script and run the current line.
The top two rows of captaincyOne are shown on the Console window.
Click on the data frame captaincyOne.
Suppose we want to extract two rows from bottom of captaincyOne.
For this, we will use the tail function.
Click on the script myDataSet.R
In the Source window, type tail within parentheses captaincyOne comma space 2.
Save the script and run the current line.
The last two rows of captaincyOne are shown on the Console window.
Next, let us learn about str function.
This function is used to display the structure of an R object.
In the Source window, type str within parentheses captaincyOne.
Save the script and run the current line.
The structural details of captaincyOne are shown on the Console.
Now, we will look at merging of data frames.
Merging data frames has advantages like:
It makes data more available.
It helps in improving data quality.
Combining similar data also reduces data complexity.
Let us switch to RStudio.
We will learn how to merge two data frames CaptaincyData.csv and CaptaincyData2.csv.
We will declare a variable captaincyTwo to store and read CaptaincyData2.csv.
In the Source window, type the following command and press Enter.
Now, type View within parentheses captaincyTwo.
Save the script and run the last two lines.
The contents of captaincyTwo appear in the Source window.
This data frame has the same captains as that in captaincyOne.
However, it has different information about them like the number of matches drawn.
Now, we will update captaincyOne by adding information from captaincyTwo.
For this, we use merge function.
Click on the script myDataSet.R
I am resizing the Source window.
In the Source window, type the following command.
In the merge function, we use column names by which we want to merge two data frames.
Here, it is names.
Now, type View and captaincyOne in parentheses.
Save the script and run these two lines.
The contents of the updated captaincyOne appear in the Source window.
Close the two tabs captaincyOne and captaincyTwo.
Now, we will learn how to import data of different formats in R.
We shall add one comment first.
In the Source window, type # hash space Importing data in different formats.
Now, let us import CaptaincyData.xml file.
For that, we need to install XML package.
Make sure that you are connected to Internet.
We need to install Ubuntu package libxml2-dev  before installing XML package.
Information on how to install this package, is provided in the Additional Material.
I have already installed libxml2-dev package.
Hence, I will proceed for installing XML package now.
On the Console window, type install dot packages.
Now, type XMLinside double quotes and in parentheses.
Press Enter. We will wait until R installs the package.
Then, we load this package using library function.
Click on the script myDataSet.R
Since we are loading a package, we will add it at the top of the script.
In the Source window, scroll up.
Now, at the top of the script myDataSet.R, type library and XML in parentheses.
Save the script and run this line.
Now, in the Source window, click on the next line after the comment Importing data in  different formats.
Type the following command and press Enter.
Then type View and xmldata in parentheses.
Save the script and run these two lines.
The contents of the xml file are shown here.
Next let us learn how to import CaptaincyData.txt.
Click on the script myDataSet.R
In the Source window, type the following command
Next, type View and txtdata in parentheses.
Save the script and run these two lines.
The contents of the txt file are shown.
Now, we will learn how to import data from user interface of Rstudio.
I am resizing the Source window.
We will import the Excel file CaptaincyData.xlsx using this method.
Please ensure that you have packages like readxl and Rcpp installed in your system.
In the top right corner of RStudio, click on the Environment tab.
In the Environment tab, click on Import Dataset.
From the drop-down menu, select From Excel.
A window named Import Excel Data appears.

The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops using spoken tutorials
The Spoken Tutorial forum is for specific questions on this tutorial.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Implementing proportional controller on SBHS remotely.
In this tutorial, we will learn to:  Use Ziegler-Nichols tuning method to calculate proportional controller gain
Modify step test code to design a proportional controller
Implement this proportional controller on SBHS.
Ensure that Scilab is installed on your computer.
Also, ensure that you have internet connectivity before you begin with this tutorial.
I am recording this tutorial on a Windows 7, 32-bit Operating System.
As a pre-requisite, watch the tutorial on Using SBHS Virtual labs on Windows OS.
This tutorial is available on the Spoken Tutorial website.
It will teach you how to do a basic step test experiment on SBHS, remotely.
You also need to have basic knowledge of PID tuning.
You should have the step test experiment code folder available with you.
You should also have the step test experiment data file with you.
If not, then it is recommended that you re-do the step test experiment and generate a new data file.
In my machine, the data file is within the Scilab_codes_windows folder >> step test folder >> logs folder.
Here is a folder with my username and here is my data file.
Let us now download the Analysis code from the website.
Open a web browser and go to the web site: sbhs dot os hyphen hardware dot in.
On the left hand side, click on Downloads.
Download the file SBHS Analysis Code and save it on the Desktop.
Here it is! The file downloaded will be in a zip format.
Right-click and extract the contents of the zip file.
A folder named Scilab codes analysis will be created.
Open this folder.
Locate and open the folder Step Analysis.
The Step Analysis folder will have few more folders.
Copy-paste the data file generated earlier inside the Kp tau order1 folder.
Double-click on the Scilab file firstorder.
If it doesn't open the file, click on the File menu and then on Open a file.
Choose the file firstorder and click on Open.
Locate the variable filename and change its value to the filename of your data file.
I will copy-paste the filename to avoid spelling mistakes.
Keep the ".txt" extension.
Save and execute this Scilab code.
If the data file is not corrupted and there are no errors, a plot window will open.
This plot window will show two graphs,  the SBHS temperature plot which has noise  and output of the SBHS first order model which is a smooth curve.
This code basically does the job of fitting a first order transfer function using the data file.
The values of time constant tau and gain Kp are displayed on the top.
In this tutorial, we will not use the first order transfer function.
We will only use the plot of the SBHS output.
Locate the line plot2d of t comma y underscore prediction.
We don't want the prediction output to appear on the plot.
Comment out this line by putting two forward slashes at the beginning of the line.
Save and execute the Scilab code.
Switch to the plot window.
Notice that the plot window now has only the SBHS temperature plot.
To save this image, click on the File menu.
Then choose Export to option.
Give a name to the image file. I will type sbhsplot.
Click on the drop-down menu for Files of type and choose PNG.
Choose the directory where you want to save this file.
I will choose Desktop and click on Save.
Let us open and see if the image file is created on the Desktop.
Here it is!
Close this image window.
Let me now switch to the slides.
Let us calculate the value of proportional gain using Ziegler-Nichols tuning method.
There are two tuning rules given by Ziegler-Nichols to calculate the PID parameters. These are Reaction curve method and  Instability method.
We will see the Reaction curve method.
In this method, a step input is given to the system and its output is observed over a period of time.
Any practical system would respond exponentially to a step input.
A tangent is drawn at the point of inflection
that is, when the curve changes from convex to concave.
The dead time and time constant are calculated from the time axis.
This is illustrated in this figure. This is the tangent line drawn at the point of inflection .
'K' is the gain of the system,
'L' is the dead time and
'T' is the time constant.
Replicate this on the SBHS output figure which is saved on the Desktop.
I have already done this.
Let me open this file.
I have used paint brush which is a default image editing tool on Windows.
I have got the values of  gain equal to 2.7,  dead time equal to 1 second and time constant equal to 50 seconds.
Note that these are all approximate values.
The values depend on the accuracy with which you draw the tangent line at the inflection point.
After you get the required values, refer to the table given by Ziegler-Nichols to calculate the value of proportional gain.
For a proportional controller, we need to calculate only the value of proportional gain.
In my case, the value of proportional gain comes out to be 18.
Now, let us see how to implement the proportional controller on SBHS.
We would modify the step test code for this.
Switch to the folder where you have the step test code.
Here it is.  Make a copy of this folder.
Rename this folder as proportional and open it.
Rename the stepc file to proportional.
Rename the steptest dot sci file to proportional.
Rename the steptest dot xcos file to proportional.
Close Scilab, if already running.
Double-click on the proportional dot sce file.
This should launch Scilab automatically and also open the file in Scilab editor.
If it doesn't open the file, click on  the File menu, and then on Open a file.
Choose the file proportional and click on Open.
Change the exec command to execute proportional.sci file, instead of steptest.sci file.
Change the xcos command to execute the proportional.xcos file, instead of steptest.xcos file.
Save this file.
Click on the File menu and choose Open.
Select the file proportional.sci  and click on Open.
Change the function name from steptest to proportional.
Delete the input variable heat from the proportional function input and type setpoint.
In the next line, type global, leave a space and then type temp and press Enter.
In the next line, type: err equal to setpoint minus temp.
Add semicolon at the end and press Enter.
In the next line, type: heat equal to 18 multiplied by err. Add a  semicolon at the end.
Here, 18 is the value of the proportional gain for my SBHS.
You may change it according to what you would have calculated for your SBHS.
Add setpoint in the input variable of the plotting function , inside its function call.
To do so, add a space after temp and type setpoint.
Save this file.
Switch to the Scilab console. Type xcos and press Enter.
xcos window will open.
Close the palette window.
On the xcos untitled window, click on File menu and choose Open.
Browse to the proportional directory.
Select proportional.xcos and click on Open.
Xcos file will open.
Double-click on the label Heat input in percentage.
Delete it and type setpoint.
Click once anywhere on the xcos window to save the label.
Double-click on the step input block to open its Properties window.
Change the Initial Value to 30 and Final Value to 40.
Keep Step time as 300. Click on Ok.
Double-click on the function block. A window will appear. Click on OK.
Another window will appear.
Here, there is an option to enter the function name to be called by this xcos block.
Change the function name from step test to proportional. Click on Ok.
Another window will open.
Keep clicking on Ok three times to finish the configuration of function block.
Save the 'xcos' diagram and close it.
Close the xcos untitled window as well.
Switch to the web browser.
On the left hand side, click on Virtual labs.
Login with your registered username and password. Book a slot.
Switch to the proportional folder. Double-click on the file run.
This will open the SBHS client application.
Login with your username and password. Make sure you are logging in at the booked slot time.
Expect the message "Ready to execute Scilab code".
Switch to the Scilab console.
Type: get d space dot dot slash common files. Press Enter.
Switch to the Scilab editor. Execute the file proportional.sce.
If the network is fine, then it will automatically open the xcos window with a proportional controller xcos diagram.
Execute this xcos diagram and expect a plot window.
The plot window will have three plots heat, fan, temperature.
Setpoint will also be plotted in the temperature graph.
Observe that the proportional controller computes the value of heat in order to achieve the setpoint value of temperature.
Run this experiment long enough to observe what happens after a step change in setpoint occurs.
I will now pause this recording until the experiment is executed for sufficient time.
You can see that the proportional controller has responded to the change in the setpoint.
You can observe that the proportional controller inherently has the property of offset.
A proportional controller will always have an offset between the setpoint value and the actual value.
Now, let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to- Use Ziegler-Nichols tuning method to calculate proportional controller gain for SBHS

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Sets in Python.
In this tutorial, you will learn to, Create sets from lists
Perform union, intersection and symmetric difference operations
Check if a set is a subset of other and
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to run basic Python commands on the ipython console and use lists
First let us see the overview of sets.
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
The set itself is mutable.
Let us look at how to input sets.
Type,
Type, a is equal to set inside brackets a underscore list
Then type, a
We can see that duplicates are removed and the set contains only unique elements.
Sets can also be created directly as follows
Type, b is equal to inside curly braces 1 comma 2 comma 1 comma 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 2
Type, b. As before, we see that the set contains only unique elements.
To create an empty set, type, c is equal to set open and close brackets
Note that d is equal to open and close curly braces creates an empty dictionary, not an empty set.
Sets can contain numbers, strings and tuples.
Type, b underscore list is equal to inside square brackets again inside square brackets 1 comma 2 comma 1 comma 6 comma 2
Now type, b is equal to set inside brackets b underscore list
As you can see, it gives a TypeError.
Now let us perform some operations on sets.
Type the sets as shown.
Here, f is the set of fibonacci numbers from 1 to 10.
And p is the set of prime numbers from 1 to 15.
Various operations can be performed on sets.
First we will add an element to a set by using add method.
Type, f dot add inside brackets 13
Now type, f
add method has no effect if the element is already present.
Type, f dot add inside brackets 13
Type, f
Next we will learn to remove an element using remove method.
Type, p dot remove inside brackets 13
Now type, p. As you can see, 13 is removed from the set p.
If the element is not a member, it raises a KeyError.
Type, p dot remove inside brackets 18
KeyError is raised since element 18 is not present in p.
The pipe character stands for union.
Type, f pipe p
Or type, f dot union inside brackets p
The ampersand character stands for intersection.
Type, f ampersand p
It gave the intersection of f and p.
Type, f minus p
It gave all the elements that are in f but not in p.
Type, f caret p
Or type, f dot symmetric underscore difference inside brackets p
It gives all the elements in f union p but not in f intersection p.
In mathematical terms, it gives the symmetric difference.
Sets also support checking of subsets.
Type, a is equal to set inside brackets inside square brackets 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4
Type, b is equal to set inside brackets inside square brackets 1 comma 2
Now type, b less than or equal to a
It gives  True since b is a subset of a.
Sets also support checking of supersets.
Or type, b dot issuperset inside brackets a
We get False since b is not a superset of a.
Every set is a subset as well as a superset of itself.
Type,  a less than or equal to a
It gives True in both cases since a is a superset and subset of itself.
Elements of a set can be accessed using for loop.
Type, for x in a colon print inside brackets x
The items from the set will not appear in any specific order.
The length and containership check on sets are similar as in lists and tuples.
Type, len inside brackets a
Type,
It prints True and False respectively
Sets do not support indexing.
Given a list of marks, as shown, list all the duplicate marks.
Switch to the terminal for the solution.
Type, marks is equal to inside square brackets 20 comma 23 comma 22 comma 23 comma 20 comma 21 comma 23
marks underscore set is equal to set inside brackets marks
for num in marks underscore set colon
remove method only removes the first occurrence of an element from the list.
Type, duplicates is equal to set inside bracket marks
Now type, duplicates
We now have duplicate marks in the set duplicates.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to, Make sets from lists or by using curly braces
Perform union, intersection and symmetric difference operations
Check if a set is a subset of other using the less than or equal to operator
Understand the various similarities with lists like length and containership
First. If a is assigned as follows, what is set of a
Second. Given odd and squares as shown.  How do you find the symmetric difference of these two sets?
Third. If a is a set, how do you check if a variable b exists in a?
Second. To find the symmetric difference between two sets, we use the operator caret. So we can type odd caret squares
Third. To check the containership, we type, b in a

Hello friends! Welcome to the tutorial on using plot command interactively in IPython.
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
Pre-requisites to practise this tutorial are -
If not, for relevant Python tutorials, please visit this website.
Let's first understand what is Pylab.
Pylab is a convenient Python module
After running percentage pylab in the iPython console, you will see a message-
This means matplotlib is running.
But sometimes you may get an error that says-
In such cases, you have to install matplotlib and run this command again.
Let's come back to the ipython console. Type 'linspace' followed by a question mark in ipython console.  Press Enter.
Please note that the command is linspace and not linespace.
The displayed information says that
Press q to exit the documentation and return to the console.
Let's try to generate 100 points from 1 to 100. Type: linspace brackets 1 comma 100 comma 100
Here, 1 is the start , 100 is the stop and the next 100 is the number of points. Now, press Enter.
As you can see, a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 is displayed.
Now let's try to generate 200 points between 0 and 1.
We do that by typing linspace brackets 0 comma 1 comma 200 and press Enter.
Here is the expected sequence of numbers.
In linspace, the start and stop points can be integers, decimals or constants.
Let us now learn about the len function.
First we will generate 100 points between minus pi and pi.
So, type: linspace brackets minus pi comma pi comma 100 and press Enter.
Here 'pi' is a constant defined by pylab.
Now, let us save this to a variable, say t.  Press Enter.
If we now type: len bracket t and press Enter, we will get the number of points between minus pi and pi.
len function gives the no. of elements present in a given sequence.
Next, let's try and plot a cosine curve between minus pi and pi.
For this, we use the plot command. Type: plot brackets t comma cos(t) and press Enter.
As you can see from the cosine plot, cos(t) gets the cosine value at every point corresponding to point t.
We can also assign the value of cos(t) to a variable cosine by typing cosine equals to cos(t). Press Enter.
And then plot by typing plot(t comma cosine) and press Enter.
To clear the plot, we have to use the clf() function. This avoids overlapping of new plots over older plots.
In the console, type: clf() and press Enter. The previous plot is cleared and a blank plot window is displayed.
Now, let's try to plot a sine plot.
Type: plot brackets t comma sin(t) and press Enter. A sine plot is displayed.
To study the plot better on the plot window, we can use various options that are available on it.
Moving the mouse pointer along the plot gives us the location of each point on the plot.
Notice here, at the bottom left of the window, there are a few buttons.
The right-most among them is for saving the file. Just click on it and type the file name.
Let us save the plot by the name sin underscore curve in pdf format.
Click on the dropdown here. As you can see, there are many formats in which to save the file.
We have to specify the format that we prefer at the time of saving.
To the left of the save button, is the slider button. Using this button, we can specify the margins of the plot window.
To the left of the slider button is the zoom button . It is used to zoom into the plot. Just specify the region to zoom into.
The button to the left of zoom, can be used to move the axes of the plot.
The next two buttons with left and right arrow icons, change the state of the plot.
It takes us to the previous or next state of the plot.  It acts like the back and forward button in a browser.
The last one is 'home', referring to the initial plot.
Pause the video here, try out the following exercise and then resume the video.
Plot (sin(x) multiplied by sin(x)) divided by x.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:
find the length of sequences using len function,
usage of buttons in the UI of the plot window such as -
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve -
2. How can we find the length of a sequence ?
3. What will the command linspace(minus pi comma pi comma 100) do?
And the answers are-
len(sequence underscore name) is the function used to find out the length of a sequence.
The command linspace(minus pi comma pi comma 100) will return 100 evenly spaced samples from -pi to pi including both minus pi and pi.

Welcome to  Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany.
In this tutorial, I will explain you the drawing tools in detail.
The first drawing tool is Pencil and it works with very hard edges.
Here I have drawn a straight line and if I zoom into the image, you can see each pixel is either black or white.
When I select the paint brush for drawing, I get a line which has soft edges.
And when I switch back to zoom, you can see a hard line with visible jaggies when drawn with pencil.
And when I draw with paint brush I get a soft line.
Back to the pencil here.
You see the pencil is very sharp in the edges and paint brush is smooth.
But you can't see here the jaggies.
This is called trick of the eye.
When I enlarge it, you see it here, it's anti-aliased.
This is the main difference between the pencil and the paint brush.
Otherwise they are nearly equal and their options too.
Now, let's start with the paint brush.
Click on the Paint brush tool in the tool box and you get the options for that.
The Modes are just the same as in the layer modes as you can see here Multiply or Overlay and so on.
Here is the Opacity slider and by using this you can control the visibility and the colour of the line.
I slide the value to say 25% and now when I draw, I get a light grey line instead of black.
And when I cross this line with a new line you can see that the colour gets stronger but it only happens if I go over it with a new line.
I zoom into this part and select a bigger Brush.
And now when I draw a line, it's gray.
And I draw a second line and the intersection of these two lines is dark gray.
And now, I draw a third line over here and intersection gets more darker gray but when I paint back with the same line it doesn’t get darker.
So, this works only from stroke to stroke and you can easily paint an area with gray and you don’t have to watch carefully while filling this.
Here you can see an option called Incremental .
When you select Incremental, you get much stronger effect.
Let's go to the options of the Brushes and here you can see the spacing of this brush is set to 20%.
Brushes is basically a stamp which stamps the same pattern on and on.
And when I zoom in here, you can see, after 20% of the size of the brush, there is a next impression of this brush.
Here each brush overlays itself.
When you de-select Incremental option, you can see each stamping of the brush but there is no painting over and I have to start a second line.
And when I select Incremental, I can paint over and over.
Go back to 100% .
I have covered Opacity and Incremental options.
Let's go back with the opacity with 100% and I can draw again perfect black.
Incremental is meaningful only if you have an opacity lower than 100%.
Scale slider controls the size of the pen here and when I slide down to 1, you get a small size of the brush.
When I scale the brush to say 0.05, I can draw a very fine line and I set the slider to say 2 and  I have a broad line.
Scale basically controls the diameter of the brush and you can also control with the 'square brackets' on the keyboard.
With the help of open square bracket, I can reduce the size of brush and with close square bracket, I can increase the size.
You can see that the brush is nearly invisible.
So, I can adjust the size of brush without leaving the area where I paint.
If someone of the GIMP people are looking forward, I would love to have a button to get back the slider to 1.
So, Scale option is covered.
And I will cover the brush in detail in next tutorial.
Here is an option called Pressure sensitivity and I can use it while editing the image. So,
let's have a look, here, at Opacity.
Now, when I draw without a lot of pressure, you get a line which is gray in colour and when I increase the pressure I get a dark colour and when I decrease the pressure, I get a light coloured line.
This option is useful if you are painting a mask.
This is quite useful.
Next option is Hardness.
When I draw with not much pressure, there is a soft border and when I increase the pressure, the paint brush acts like a pen.
When I select the pencil tool and draw, I get hard border and this can make a hard border if I really press on the tablet.
I can change the size of the brush with Pressure sensitivity.
I can also change the colour using Pressure sensitivity.
So, I select another colour from the background colour, how  this one here?
So, let's select this red colour.
And for the foreground colour, let's select a nice green.
And when I start painting here with the selected colour, with low pressure I get green and when I am increasing the pressure I get red and if released, I get green or greenish stuff again.
And in between the colour changes between green and red.
The last option is using colour from the gradients.
To select the Gradients, go to File, Dialogs and Gradients.
Here is the Gradients.
And now I just grab this window and pull it to here and now I have a gradient here.
In Gradients, I have a big selection of patterns.
Let’s select this one and now I go back here.
Now, when I am painting, the paint goes through this pattern on the gradient.
It's quite funny for some things like writing or working with gradients.
It looks like made out of tube or so.
These were the options of the gradient.
These options are common for all the tools which use brushes.
i.e,  Pencil, the Paint brush, the Eraser and the Airbrush which has some additional options.
The Ink has no brush but it has lot of the other options.
The Clone tool, the Healing tool , the Perspective clone tool and even tools like Blur/sharpen or dodge/burn have the option of brushes.
Now, let's go back to Pencil and Paint brush.
Just clear this again.
There are some tricks which you can use here.
The first trick is about drawing a line.
When I try to draw a straight line its a bit difficult.
But when I first set one point with a click and press the shift key, I get a straight line.
Here I have a straight line.
The next trick is, just set one point and press Shift + Ctrl and now the rotation of my line is locked to 15 degrees.
And so I can draw easily straight lines with defined angles.
So, what a master piece here.
There is something else that you can do with this Shift key.
For that, select the Gradient tool.
Draw a line with gradient selected and you get lot of different colours.
I select a small Brush and de-select the Gradient tool and select my standard colours.
Now, when I press the Ctrl key, I can select a colour from the line I had drawn and you can see, the foreground colour is changed to the blue tone.
So, I can pick a colour, somewhere out of the image which is quite nice.
And if you want to paint in something in a picture and it has the colour you need.
Just Ctrl click on it and you have that specific colour on your pallet.
That is a nice trick.
Basically the Eraser tool is the same tool as the pen or the Brush because it's just the opposite of them.
The Eraser also paints but it gives the background color.
You can see it here.
But, for that, you should de-select the Pressure  sensitivity and Opacity.
When I just switch the Foreground colour and the Background colour to black and white and switch white as the foreground colour and select the Pen, I can get the same effect as the Eraser.
After changing the colour erasing gets black.
You can change the Foreground and Background Colour by pressing the X key.
I have  covered the Pencil, the Paint brush and also the Eraser in detail.

Welcome to the series of Blender tutorials.
This tutorial is about the User Preferences window in Blender 2.59.
This script has been contributed by Bhanu Prakash and edited by Monisha Banerjee.
After watching this tutorial, we shall learn what is User Preferences window;
what are the different options available in the User Preferences window;
and how to customize the Blender interface using the User Preferences window.
If not, then please refer to our earlier tutorial-
Basic Description of the Blender Interface.
Go to File at the top left corner of the Blender interface.
Left click to open File.
Here, is a list of options which have been explained already in the tutorial File Browser and Info Panel.
Select User Preferences.
For keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl, Alt & U.
This is User Preferences window.
Go to Interface  at the top left corner of the User Preferences window.
This contains several options for customizing the Blender interface.
The basic required options are already activated by default.
Display Mini Axis controls the size of the mini axis present at the bottom left corner of the 3D view.
The default size is 25.
I am using Size 60 for better viewing purposes in the Blender Tutorials series.
Let me demonstrate.
Close the User preferences window.
At the bottom left corner of the 3D view, we can see the mini axis.
The mini axis represents the global transform axis of the 3D space in Blender.
It is useful when animating in Blender.
We will discuss about global and local transform axis in detail in subsequent tutorials.
Press Ctrl, Alt & U to open the User Preferences window.
Activate Rotate around selection .
This enables you to orbit around the center of the selected object.
Let us see what this means.
Close the User preferences window.
Right-click the lamp in the 3D view.
Press and hold mouse wheel or middle mouse button and move your mouse.
We are orbiting around the selected object.
Similarly, right-click the Camera.
Press and hold mouse wheel or middle mouse button and move your mouse.
Now, we are rotating around the camera.
Press Ctrl, Alt & U to open the 'User Preferences window'.
Left-click Editing.
This contains parameters that reflect the behavior of Blender in Object editing mode or the Edit Mode.
Again, the basic options already activated by default.
Global undo increases/decreases the number of undo steps that might be required while editing.
Left click Input.
Here, we can customize all the keyboard shortcuts used in Blender.
Emulate 3-Button Mouse will make your 2-button mouse behave like a 3-button mouse in Blender.
Select with can change the selection option of your mouse from right to left.
This is useful for left-handed users.
Emulate numpad will make the number keys on your keyboard behave like the numpad keys in Blender.
This is useful for laptop users who don't have a separate numpad on the keyboard.
Left click Add-Ons.
This contains the list of plug-ins in Blender.
Left-click Enabled .
Some plug-ins are activated by default.
Other plug-ins can be installed from the respective website.
For example, let us install a plug-in for crating clouds.
Left click Object.
Left click on the triangle next to Object : Cloud generator.
Left click Link to Wiki.
This link opens a web-page on our internet browser.
I am using Firefox 3.09 internet browser.
Here, we can download and install the Cloud Generator plug-in for Blender.
Just follow the instructions on this page.
The steps shown here are similar in all internet browsers.
Left click Theme.
Here, you can change the color of each panel of the Blender interface.
For example, left-click Timeline.
Here, you can see the color of the Current Frame indicator, Grid and all other attributes as well.
Left click the green bar next to current frame.
This is the colour mode window in Blender.
The white dot here, over the green area, controls the colour of the Current Frame indicator.
I am going to change it to red.
Left click the white dot, hold and drag your mouse to the red area.
Release left-click.
Notice, how the values of 'RGB' have changed as well.
In this way, we can change the colour of the other listed options too.
Here, we can set the location of Fonts, Textures, Plugins, Render Output, Scripts, Sounds etc. on our system.
Let us set the location for Fonts.
Left click the file icon at the right end of the first rectangle bar.
A file browser opens.
By default, we are inside the local C drive directory.
Left click the Windows directory.
Navigate to Fonts.
Left click Accept at the top right corner of the screen.
A path has appeared on the first rectangle bar.
Blender now knows where to look for the fonts on our system.
Similarly, left click the File icon at the right end of the second rectangle bar.
Again, the file browser opens.
Now, we can set the location for the textures on our system like we did for the fonts.
What if I want to exit this file browser without selecting a location for the textures?
Left click Back to previous, next to help, at the top of the screen to return to the 'User Preferences window'.
There is no path visible on the second rectangle bar because I did not select one.
Left click System.
Here, we can customize the Blender settings according to the properties of the computer we are using.
DPI changes the font size and resolution for display in Blender;
the default DPI in Blender is 72.
I am using DPI:90 for better viewing purposes in the Blender tutorials series.
Save As Default, at the bottom left corner, is used to save our customized changes in the Blender interface.
For keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl & U.
So, this was the basic information about the 'User Preferences window'.
Apart from these, there are other options present in 'user preferences window' which will be discussed in the later tutorials.
Now, try to open the 'user preferences window' in Blender using the keyboard shortcut.
Then, using Rotate around selection, make the cube the centre of rotation in the '3D view'.
Install cloud generator plug-in for Blender,
change the colour of the current crame indicator in the timeline and set the location for render output on your computer.
All the best!
And that completes this tutorial on User Preferences.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Exporting the geometry from Salome to OpenFOAM.
In this tutorial, we will see :  To group the meshed geometry parts in Salome
To record this tutorial, I am using: Linux operating system, Ubuntu version 12.10 OpenFOAM version 2.1.1 ParaView version 3.12.0
To practice this tutorial, the learner should first perform the tutorial on Creating and meshing a Curved-Pipe Geometry in Salome.
Open Salome as shown in the previous tutorial. Go to file >> Open. Go to Desktop. Click on Curved-geometry.hdf.
Press Open. Go to mesh-module from Modules drop-down option.
Open the 'Mesh' tree from the  object Browser.
Right-click on Mesh_1. Click on Show. We see the mesh on the geometry is visible.
Let me close the python console window.
Now, we have to name the  meshed geometry parts as we require it in OpenFOAM.
To create Groups on this mesh, right-click on Mesh_1 and click on Create Group.
Select the Element Type as Face. Select the Group type as Group on Geometry.
Click on the button in front of Geometrical Object and select Direct Geometrical Selection.
Open the 'Geometry' tree in the Object Browser. Open the pipe_1 tree and  select the inlet group in the geometry tree that  we had created in the previous tutorial.
You can select the color as red.
Name the group as inlet. Click on Apply and close. inlet group is seen in the tree.
Similarly, create the outlet group. I have created the outlet group.
Now, to create the group of the whole outer surface, right-click on mesh_1 >> Create group .
Select the Element Type as Face  and the Group Type as Group on filter.
Click on Set filter. Click on the Add button. In the drop-down option below Criterion menu, select Free Faces.  Click on Apply and Close.
You can change the color to blue.
Again click on Apply and Close. Group_1 has been created.
Now, in the mesh menu at the top, click on Cut groups. Select the Main object as Group_1. Select the Tool object as inlet.
Hold the shift key on your keyboard and also select the Tool object as outlet.
Type the Result name as walls.
You can select the color as purple. click on Apply and Close. We see walls group has been created.
Right-click on Group_1 and delete this group as we do not want to see it in OpenFOAM.
Save the work by clicking on save document option.
Now, right-click on mesh_1. Go to Export >> Unv File.
Name the file as bentpipe. I am saving this file on the Desktop. Close Salome. We see bentpipe.unv file on the desktop.
Create a folder named "bentpipe" on the desktop.
Now, move "bentpipe.unv" file to this folder.
To perform simulation on this geometry in OpenFOAM using icoFoam solver, go to the icoFoam folder in OpenFOAM.
For the location of this folder, go to the tutorial on lid driven cavity.
Copy and Paste the "bentpipe" folder on the desktop, in this  icoFoam folder.
Also, copy the system folder from the cavity folder to this bentpipe folder.
Now, go inside this bentpipe folder throgh command terminal. I am inside the bentpipe folder.
Type "ls" and press Enter. We  see the systemfolder and the bentpipe.unv file.
Now, type: ideasUnvToFoam space bentpipe dot unv. Note that U, T and F are capital. Press Enter.
Now, type "ls". We see constant folder has been created. Type cd (space) Constant.
Type cd (space) polyMesh. Type "ls". Press Enter.
We see geometry files have been created. Come out of the polyMesh folder.
Come out of the constant folder.
Now, to convert the geometry scale to centimeters, type:  transformPoints (space) -scale space '(0.01 space 0.01 space 0.01)' and press Enter. The Geometry has been converted to centimeters.
Minimize the terminal. Go inside the bentpipe folder.
Go inside the constant folder. We see that the transportProperties file is not there.
Copy the transportProperties file from the cavity folder and save it inside the constant folder.
I have copied the transport Properties file. Now, come out of the constant folder.
We need the 0 (zero) folder having 'P' and 'U' files.Copy the '0 '(zero) folder from the cavity folder.
I have copied the'0' (zero) folder. Go inside the '0' (zero) folder.
Open the 'p' file. Make sure that you give boundary patches for inlet, outlet and walls as we had created in Salome.
Erase movingWall and type "inlet". Erase fixedWalls and type "outlet".
Erase frontAndBack and type "walls". Save the file and Close the file.
Similarly, make changes in 'U' file. For appropriate boundary conditions, you can refer to the tutorial on Hagen-Poiseuille flow.
I have made the changes and given the appropriate boundary conditions.
You may also make the changes in transportProperties and ControlDict files by referring to the tutorial on Hagen-Poiseuille flow.
Let's close the Home folder.
Now, go to terminal. Type  paraFoam. This will open ParaView. Click on Apply in the Object Inspector menu.
In the drop-down menu. click on Surface with Edges. Let's have a closer look by zooming in.
We see hexahedral mesh. We also see the groups have been created as we had named it in Salome- Inlet outlet and walls.
Volume inside the surface is automatically grouped as internal mesh.
For Assignment,Run the simulation by making appropriate changes in the files as described.

I am Saurabh Sawant, from IIT Bombay. Thank you.
create a Table by-
a) Creating Views and
b) Using the Copy method.
Let's go to our Library database.
Let us click on the Tables icon on the left panel.
On the right panel, we see three ways of creating a table.
We will go through the Create View option now.
Before that, let us learn about Views. What is a View?
A view is similar to a table but it does not hold the data.
It is defined as a Query Expression, which is simply retrieval of data from tables or other views from the database.
So, when viewed, it has columns and rows of data just like a table.
Views can be used to allow limited access
or hide the structure and names of the underlying table columns and table data.
For example, we can create a simple view which will list all the members of the library
and we can leave out their phone numbers to maintain confidentiality.
Here the underlying table would be Members.
Other users of the Library database can be allowed to access this view but not the Members table.
In this way, we can only see the names of the members and not their phone numbers.
Okay, let us go back to the main Base window and create this view.
Let us click on Create View on the right panel.
We see a new window called the View Design and a pop-up window that says Add tables.
Let us click on Members
and close this pop-up window.
Now, we are in the View design window.
And we will double-click on the MemberId and the Name fields.
Adding the 'Id' field is always useful
because this helps us to join this view with any other related table, for example- the BooksIssued Table.
We can add functions, criteria and sort it any way we want.
But for now, we will sort the member names in ascending order.
For this, let us click on the empty cell in the Sort row under the Name column in the bottom section.
And then click on ‘ascending’.
Let us save our first view.
Here, let us type a descriptive name for this view- View: Members Name Only.
And let us click on the OK button.
To see the underlying data, let us click on the Edit menu at the top
and then click on Run Query at the bottom.
And we see a new section at the top that lists all the members of the 'Library' in ascending order.
Note that we don’t see any phone numbers.
And there is our simple view.
We can create and design views according to our requirements.
Before moving on to the next topic, here is an assignment.
Create a View of 'Books Issued' to Members and only those books that are not checked-in.
Include in the view, the following fields: Book Titles, Member Names, Issue Date and Return Date.
Name the view as 'View: List of Books not checked in'.
Okay, let us learn to create tables by using the copy method.
This is an easy way of creating tables, if we know that the table structures are going to be very similar.
For this, let us assume that our Library has DVDs and CDs.
And we can store this data in a new table called Media.
A CD or a DVD can have a title and a publish-year for example.
In order to distinguish between an audio and a video, we will introduce a MediaType field.
Now, since the Books table has almost similar fields, we can copy-paste the Books table
and then we can rename the fields and the table name in the process.
We’ll see how.
Let us go to the main Base window.
Here, let us right-click on the Books table
and we will see the Copy option. Let us click on it.
And then right-click on it.
Notice the various options here. There is a Paste and  also there is a Paste Special.
We can use copy and paste in a specific format.
Possible formats are Formatted text, HTML or a Data Source Table.
So, we can choose the database table here
or we can choose Paste from the right-click menu.
This opens a wizard and in this window,
we will first rename our table by typing in ‘Media’ against the table name.
In the options, we will click on 'Definition and data'.
Let us click on the Next button.
In the next window, we will add the columns.
Let us choose BookId, title and publish-year for this demonstration.
Now, we will select these fields on the left and use the single arrow button to move them to the right side
and click on Next button.
In the next window, we see our columns.
Here, we can rename the fields and change their data types.
We will rename the BookId to MediaId.
And we will click on the Create button.
In the main Base window, there is our new Media table.
Let us now edit the table to add a new field MediaType  which will hold the audio or the video type information.
Now, we are in the Table Design window.
Here, let us introduce MediaType as the last column.
Let us click on the cell below publishyear
and enter 'MediaType’ as Field Name and then choose Text for Field Type.
Now, let us save the table design and we are done.
There, we just created our Media table by using the Copy method.
Okay, here is another assignment.
Create a table using the ‘Use Wizard to Create table’ method.
Here, use the ‘Assets’ sample table and rename it to ‘AssetsCopy’
and explore the various options in this method.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Creating Tables in LibreOffice Base.
To summarize, we learned how to-

Two parallel lines g and i intersect at a point.
Click on Intersect tool and click on the point of intersection as D.
Now using the Segment tool, join the points, C, D and D, B.
Parallelogram ABDC is now complete.
We will hide the lines g and i, so that we can see the parallelogram clearly.
Right-click on line g, from the submenu click on Show Object check-box.
Now we will explore the properties of parallelogram ABDC.
From the Algebra view, we can find that,
Observe that, the opposite sides are parallel and equal.
Let us now measure the angles of the parallelogram.
Click on Angle tool.
C A B
A B D
B D C.
Observe that the opposite angles are equal.
Now we will convert the parallelogram ABDC to a rectangle.
Click on Move tool.
Drag the labels to see them clearly.
Observe that all the angles changed to 90 degrees.
Now let us learn to construct a kite.
For this I will open a new GeoGebra window.
Click on File and select New Window.
To contruct a kite, we will draw two circles that intersect at two points.
Click on Circle with Centre through point tool.
Then click on Graphics view.
Point A is drawn, this is the centre of the circle.
Click again at some distance from point A.
Point B appears.
Similarly, we will draw another circle with centre C and passing through  D.
Notice that the two circles c and d intersect at two points.
Click on Intersect tool and click on the circles c and d.
E and F are the intersection points of the circles.
Now let us draw the required quadrilateral using these circles.
Click on Polygon tool.
Click on the points A, E, C, F and A again to complete the quadrilateral.
Notice in the Algebra View that two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.
Measure the angles of the kite and check what happens.
Draw diagonals and locate the intersection point of the diagonals.
Measure the angle at the intersection of the diagonals.
Check if diagonals bisect each other.
To delete all the objects, press Ctrl + A and then press Delete key on the Key board.
Now let us construct a rhombus.
Click on Segment with Given Length tool.
Segment with Given Length text box opens.
In the Length field, type 4 and click on OK button.
Let us construct a circle with center A and passing through  B.
Click on Circle with Centre through Point tool.
Click on points A and B to complete the circle.
Using Point tool, mark a point C on the circumference of the circle.
Click on Segment tool and then click on points A and C.
This will join the points A and C.
Click on the Parallel line tool and click on the line AB and then on point C.
We see a line parallel to AB passing through C.
Similarly, draw a parallel line to segment AC  passing through  B.
Notice that the lines i and h intersect at a point.
Using Intersect tool, we will mark the point of intersection as D.
Using the Segment tool, join the points A, D and B, C.
A quadrilateral ABDC with diagonals AD and BC is drawn.
The diagonals intersect at a point.
Check if the diagonals of the quadrilateral ABDC bisect each other.
Also check if the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors.
Now let us construct a cyclic quadrilateral.
For this, let us open Graphics 2 view.
Go to View menu and select Graphics 2 check box.
Graphics 2 view window opens, next to existing Graphics view.
Drag the border of the existing Graphics view, to see Graphics 2 view.
Now select Regular Polygon tool.
The Regular Polygon text box opens with default value 4.
Click on the OK button.
A square FGHI is drawn in Graphics 2 view.
Let's construct perpendicular bisectors to segments FG and GH.
Select the Perpendicular Bisector tool from the tool bar.
Click on the points F, Gand G, H.
Observe that the perpendicular bisectors intersect at a point.
Using Intersect tool we will mark this point as J.
Now, Let's  construct a circle with centre as J and passing through F.
Click on the Circle with center through Point tool, click on point J.
A cyclic quadrilateral FGHI is drawn.
Now we will display its area.
From the Angle tool drop down, click on the Area tool.

Welcome to the series of Blender tutorials.
This tutorial is about How to Change Window Types in Blender 2.59.
This script has been contributed by Bhanu Prakash and edited by Monisha Banerjee.
After watching this tutorial, we shall learn: * how to resize any window in the Blender interface;
how to toggle between different windows;
how to split the windows and merge them back together and
how to maximize any window into full screen mode.
If not, then please refer to our earlier tutorial-
Basic Description of the Blender Interface.
We have already seen different types of windows that are present in the Blender interface.
These windows can be re-sized.
Move the mouse cursor to the left edge of the Outliner window.
We see a double-headed arrow.
Now left click and drag your mouse.
The Outliner window re-sizes as the mouse moves.
Now, move the mouse cursor to the bottom edge of the Outliner window.
Again, we see a double-headed arrow.
Left click and drag your mouse.
The Outliner window resizes as the mouse moves.
This is how we can resize any window in the Blender interface.
Now, let’s see how to toggle between the different windows of the Blender interface.
Go to the left hand corner of the 3D view.
Here is a button with up and down arrow, displaying the current editor type.
Left click on the button.
A menu opens containing different window options.
This is Editor type menu.
This menu is present at the left hand corner of every window in the Blender interface
and is used to toggle between the different windows.
Move your mouse on the menu options.
For shortcut, you can use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard.
Left click on UV/Image Editor.
The 3D view has changed to the UV/Image editor.
Left click on the Editor type menu again and select 3D view.
Now we are back to the 3D view.
So, this is how you can toggle between different windows using Editor type menu.
The default 3D view can be divided into 4 parts.
There are two ways to divide the 3D view.
First, left click View at the bottom left corner of the 3D view, next to Editor type menu.
Select the second option from the top that says Toggle Quad view.
For shortcut, press Ctrl, Alt & Q.
The 3D view is divided into 4 different views-
Top view, Front view, Right view and Camera view.
You will find this very useful when modeling and animating in Blender.
Press Ctrl, Alt & Q to disable the Quad view.
Press space bar and type  Toggle   in the search area.
Select the option Toggle Quad view from the list.
This is the second method for enabling the Quad view.
Press Ctrl, Alt & Q to disable the Quad view again.
We are back to Blender's default Camera view.
Apart from the five different windows which are present in the Blender interface by default,
you can also add new windows to the Blender interface by dividing the area.
Again, there are two ways to do this.
Let me demonstrate this in the Outliner window.
Move your mouse cursor to the three slanted lines or the (hatched) line on the bottom left corner of the Outliner window till a 'plus' sign appears.
Hold left click and drag your mouse to the right.
The Outliner window is now divided into two new panels.
Each new panel has its own set of tools.
Now, to merge the two new panels back together, we use the same method.
The right panel needs to be merged back into the left one.
Move your mouse cursor to the hatched lines at the bottom left corner of the right Outliner panel till the plus sign appears.
Hold left-click and drag your mouse towards the left panel.
The panel is shaded and a clear arrow sign appears over it.
Release left-click.
The two windows are merged.
Now, let's see the second way to divide the window area.
First, we will divide the Outliner window horizontally.
Move your mouse cursor to the left edge of the Outliner window till a double-headed arrow appears.
Right-click on the arrow sign.
Left click Split Area.
Drag your mouse to the middle of the Outliner window.
A horizontal line appears along with the double-headed arrow.
Left-click to lock the position.
The Outliner window is now divided into two new horizontal panels.
Just like before, each panel has its own set of tools.
Now, let us merge the new panels back together in the same way.
Move your mouse cursor to the horizontal edge between the two new panels till a double-headed arrow appears.
Right click and select Join-area.
Move your mouse over any one panel - top or bottom.
I am choosing the bottom panel.
The chosen panel is shaded and a clear arrow sign appears over it.
Left click the shaded panel.
The two panels are merged back together.
Now, try to divide the Outliner window vertically and merge the new panels back together again.
Move your mouse cursor to the bottom edge of the Outliner window till a double-headed arrow appears.
Right click on the arrow sign.
Left click Split Area.
Drag your mouse to the middle of the Outliner window.
A vertical line appears along with the double-headed arrow.
Left-click to lock the position.
The Outliner window is now divided into two new vertical panels.
Move your mouse cursor to the vertical edge between the two new panels till a double-headed arrow appears.
Right click and select Join Area.
Move your mouse over any one panel - left or right.
I am choosing the right panel.
The chosen panel is shaded and a clear arrow sign appears over it.
Left click the shaded panel.
The two panels are merged back together.
Now, let's see how we can re-arrange the location of different panels in the Properties window.
For example, we want the Layers panel to be on top of the Render panel.
Move the mouse cursor to the three slanted lines at the top right corner of the Layers panel.
Press and hold left-click and drag your mouse upwards.
The Layers panel moves to the top of the Render panel.
Now, let's see how to maximize any particular window or switch to full-screen mode in Blender.
Move your mouse cursor to any window.
I am selecting the 3D view.
Press Ctrl & up arrow button on your keyboard.
The 3D view has now been maximized to full-screen mode.
To exit from full-screen mode, press Ctrl & down arrow key on your keyboard.
We are back to Blender's default view.
This can be done to any window.
So, this is how we resize any window, toggle between different windows, split the windows and merge them back together in Blender.
Now, create a new file and try to toggle the 3D view into Quad view;
split the Outliner window and merge the new panels back;
in the Properties window, move the Output panel to the top of the Render Panel
and maximize the 3D view into full-screen mode.
Also gives certificates to those who pass an online test.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Scope of variables in C and C++.
What is the Scope of variable?
What is a Global variable?
What is a Local variable?
Few  examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1.
Let us start with the introduction to the scope of variables.
It is the region of code within which the variable can be accessed.
Depending on it's type and place of declaration it is divided into two categories:
Global Variable &
Local Variable.
Now we will see an example.
Note that our file name is scope.c.
Here we have declared two global variables a and b.
And we have initialized them by assigning values as 5 and 2.
A global variable is available to all functions in your program.
These are declared outside any functions, above main() function.
These have a global scope.
Here we have declared a function add without arguments.
Here 'sum' is  a local variable, it is declared inside the function add.
A local variable is available only to the function inside which it is declared.
These variables are declared inside a block.
These have local scope.
Then sum of a & b will be stored in the variable 'sum'. Here we print the sum.
The add function is called and then executed.
Now click on Save.
Please open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
To compile, type gcc space scope.c space hyphen o space sco and press Enter.
To execute, type ./sco (dot slash sco), press Enter.
Sum of a and b is 7.
Come back to our program. First press Shift, Ctrl & S keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension .cpp  (dot cpp) and click on Save.
Let us change the header file as iostream.
Now  include the using statement. Click on save .
The  declaration of global variable and local variable is same in  C++.
So, no need to change anything.
Delete the format specifier and '\n'.
Now delete the comma.
Type two opening angle brackets.
Delete the closing bracket, again type two opening angle brackets.
And within the double quotes type backslash n. Now click on Save.
To compile, type g++ space scope dot cpp space -o space sco1
Here we have sco1 because we don't want to overwrite output parameter sco for the file 'scope.c'.
To execute type ./sco1 and press Enter.
The output is displayed as  Sum of a and b is 7.
We can see  that it is similar to our C code.
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program. Suppose here I will declare a  variable a again.
Type int a  and a semicolon.
Click on Save. We have declared  the variable 'a' above the main() function and after the add function.
Let us see what happens.
Come back to our  terminal.
Now compile as before.
We see errors, redefinition of 'int a'  ,  'int a' previously defined here. Come back to our program.
a is a global variable.
It has a global scope.
We cannot declare the variable twice as it is already declared globally.
We can only declare variable a as a local variable .
Delete this .
Let us execute again Come back to our terminal.
Now compile as before, execute as before.
Yes, it is working.
In this tutorial we learnt ,
Scope of variable,
Global variable, e.g : int a=5 &
and  local variable ,e.g:int sum
write a program to print the difference of two numbers.

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
Today’s tutorial is not about raw converting but about new coding while doing a real show and to correct some errors from the last tutorial.
I want to tell you something about this image .
I have made some additional changes while recording the show.
As you can see the sea is a bit dull and it’s just gray with not much definition in it and when I switch off the Sea layer here and the other layers, you can see there is some definition in the sea.
And when I look at the layer mask, you can see that I used a layer mask which is mostly gray for the area I wanted to show.
So, let’s redo this step again.
I have deleted the Sea layer and made a copy of the Background layer.
I name the layer as Sea and place that layer below the Sky and above the Land.
I could have worked with the layer I had but I wouldn’t have got a good result because I had used the curves tool to get the sea a bit darker.
And with that, I have destroyed a lot of colour information which was present in that layer and I’ll get a better result this way here.
Now, I again add a layer mask to the Sea layer, I use the Gray scale copy of the layer and add it.
I click on Show layer mask and edit the layer mask.
I will use the Curves tool and I’ll repeat the same procedure by pulling this down but this time I’ll pull this upper curve up.
Now I have a layer mask which is nearly white for the area of the sea and sky and nearly black for the area of land.
To correct some missing structure here, I select the Brush tool and choose a bigger Brush here and start painting the land area with black colour.
I don’t want to paint the sea layer with black colour. So, I exchange the foreground and background colour.
And go to the sea area and start painting with white colour and I think I should do this a bit softer.
This area here, I think it was quite well but you can correct that later on.
So, let’s choose a soft brush and see that we get this edge here fine.
When I disable Show Layer Mask, we can see the stretch scene here on the border between land and sea.
Let’s zoom into the image and you can see there is a halo where the layer mask and the layer don’t work together and I’ll work on it later.
Now I go back to the full image with Shift + Ctrl + E.
I select the Curves tool and check if I have layer mask selected and I include the Sky layer to see the whole image and now I click into the image and play with the curves.
Now you can see the halo between the sea and the land vanishes but the sea is now again bit dull.
But I can pull the curve up here and I get a clear sea here.
And I think I shouldn’t over do it.
I can see the sun shine on the sea, the shadow of the clouds, different wave structures and a bit blue colour as it should be on the sea.
There is a bit problem with the bright stuff at the edge of the sky because sky  is too brightened up and I can solve that problem in later steps.
Ok, I can adjust with the Opacity slider the effect of Curves tool and I think I should make it a bit less for a good effect.
A tip from John Arnold’s broadcast says that we should go to the full possible amount and then go down with the slider because it is much easier to see the effect when you go down
and we can decide the right amount easily.
And I think I have done too much with this part. So, I slide the slider down and I think this is ok.
From where does this bright stuff comes on the horizon?
I deselect the Sky layer and check but it’s not because of it.
So, I deselect the Sea layer and its because of Sea layer.
And I have to darken this part here.
And for doing that I use the Gradient tool.
I select the layer mask and now select the Gradient tool from the tool box and I want to have the land part white and sky part black and I want to have the border here.
The gradient starts with full white and ends with black.
So, I zoom into this part. I select the Gradient tool and  start around here.
While making the line, I am pressing Ctrl key and left mouse button and pulling in order to get a straight line and leave the button here.
You see, it worked! The brightness on the horizon is gone and you can see that the layer mask of the land is gone too.
Let’s have a look at the whole image and you can see all our edits are gone.
So, this wasn’t the good way to deal with the horizon so I undo this step here.
Now, first I select the rectangle and check if layer mask is selected and draw the Rectangle in the sky part.
Now when the rectangle is drawn I can do edit work inside it and rest of the layer mask will not be affected.
Now I again do the same procedure.
Zoom into the bright part here and select the Layer Mask.
I want to have black above and white below. So, I start from here, go straight up to the horizon and now you can see  the sea is only white and land and sky are black.
Shift + ctrl + A, disables all selection, shift +ctrl + E goes back to the whole image and  a lot better now.
I want to edit the Sky layer in the same way like I did for the Land layer.
Just double the Sky layer and switch to Overlay mode.
This is way too much. So I pull down the Opacity slider a bit and we have a bit more contrast in the sky.
And now I think the image is nearly ready except for one thing.
This wall of the house here is way too dark.
This is the case for dodging and burning.
Dodging and burning is a term out of the dark room days, where you can  dodge  a picture by keeping your hand or paper or something else in the light beam of the enlarger between the enlarger and photographic paper and burning is opposite of that.
There you take a paper and cut a hole in a specific form into it and so edit some light to some other parts of the image.
It’s quite tedious procedure to figure out which step to be done at what time and you need a lot of sheets of paper for that and when you want to look at such a process, I recommend you to look a film Well Photographer.
It’s a film about James and it’s a terrific film even without this, a dark chamber seen.
I can really recommend you that film.
Now let’s see dodging and burning process.
We have a Dodge and Burn tool in the toolbox here but I would like to work again with layer.
I add one more layer and I want to fill it with white .
I go to colour channel and I keep 50% for gray and 128% in other channel.
This gray colour is 50% gray and I switch the layer mode to Overlay and you can see nothing has happened.
Now I switch the colours to black and white and select a brush.
This brush size is about right. But I decrease the Opacity to let’s say 30% or so.
Now I make sure that I have the new layer  selected and change the foreground colour to white and background colour to black and I start to paint the wall here.
And perhaps you can see it that the compression has done its work and the side of the wall is brightened up.
This process is called dodging because I am keeping the light on the photographic paper and so the wall gets brighter.
When we look at the layer here you can see that I have a whiter area here and there are some other parts of the image which could be a bit lighter.
For example the rocks near the shore.
The best way would be zooming into the image and I can see that now I have made the wall brighter and the structure is nearly gone due to the JPEG compression.
But I can repair that by switching the colour and shortcut key for that is ‘X’ key and make it a bit darker here.
I should pull the Opacity slider a bit down and this is OK.
I think the horizon is very bright. So I adjust the circle size of the brush to paint that part and use black colour to darken that part of the image.
I can work through the image with changing the colour with ‘x’ key and make it a bit darker.
I think that was too much and I am not so sure about what I am doing there.
So, undo the step.
You can see the technique that I made a layer and made it medium gray & 128% for each channel and change the layer mode to Overlay.
Medium gray and Overlay mode do nothing and you can paint into the image with white or black.
While painting with white, you make the image a bit brighter; with black you make it darker.
I think now this image is really finished with editing.
I wouldn’t work again on it except some of you find a mistake in the edits I have made today.
I hope I haven’t done that and name the layer as Dodge and Burn.
That was it for today.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Exception Handling in C++.
In this tutorial, we will learn
Exception Handling.
We will do this with the help of an example.
Ubuntu OS version 11.10
g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with an introduction to Exception.
An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
It is a run-time error that a program may detect.
Let us move on to exception handling.
The response given to the problems occurred during the execution of the program is known as   exception handling.
Exception handling allows a program to continue execution.
It helps identifying the problem.
And terminates the program in a controlled manner.
Let us see the types of Exceptions-
'Try'Catch and
Throw.
We place the error prone code inside a try block.
Then it is handled using throw.
After this, the exception is caught using the catch statement.
And then it is processed.
The syntax for try, catch and throw is:
throw:The try  block and the catch  block.
Here, we pass argument.
The throw statement can be written inside the try  block as well.
We can have more than one try, catch  blocks.
Now, let us see an example on exception handling.
I have the code, I will open it.
Note that our file name is exception.cpp.
In this program, we will solve the 'divide by zero' error using exception handling.
Here we have function division() with argument as int a and int b.
Then we check whether b ==0.
If True, we throw an exception "Division by zero condition!".
The function returns division of a and b.
In this, we have declared integer variables as x, y and a double variable as  z.
Here we accept the value of x and y.
This is our try block.
Here, we have called the function division()
and stored the result in z.
Then we print the value of z.
This is our catch block.
In this, we pass an argument 'msg'  as a character constant.
Then we print the msg.
To compile, type:
Type: dot slash ex, press Enter.
Enter the value of x and y
I will give as 3 and 0.
The output is displayed as: Division by zero condition!
Let us compile again.
Press the up-arrow key twice.
Press Enter.Again press the up-arrow key twice.
Enter value of x and y
I will give as 8 and 2.
The output is 4.
This is how the try, catch and throw block work.
In this tutorial, we have seen- Exception Handling, try, catch and throw blocks.
As an assignment- Display the age of employees.
Throw an exception to check that the age is not less than 15.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on taking User input in Java, using BufferedReader .
To take user input in Java
About InputStreamReader and BufferedReader.
how to write, compile and run a simple java program in Eclipse.
You must also know  about the data types in Java.
If not, please refer to the spoken tutorial on these topics available at spoken hyphen tutorial dot org.
Now, we will learn what a BufferedReader is!
It is a class in java which is used to read text from an input stream.
It provides efficient way to read array of characters and lines.
To make use of BufferedReader , we need to import three classes from the java dot io package.
These three classes are:
We will learn about packages and how to import classes in the coming tutorials.
Now how is the input taken?
All the input that we take from the user will be in the form of string.
It has to be then typecasted or converted to the particular data type.
We will see that while we write our program to take the user input.
Now, let us see the syntax to implement BufferedReader.
Once you import the three classes, you need to create an object of InputStreamReader.
You also need to create an object of  BufferedReader.
We will learn about this in detail when we write our program.
So, let us switch to Eclipse.
I have already opened a class named InputBufferedReader.
We will begin with importing the java.io package.
So, type: before the class, import space java dot io  dot star semicolon.
This will import the classes InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and IOException.
Now,  we will make use of BufferedReader inside the main method.
We need to throw an IOException in whatever method we use the BufferedReader.
So, right after the main method type: throws space IOException.
Now, what does this mean?
Exceptions are errors which occur in Java when some unexpected circumstances occur.
To prevent Exception errors we make use of throws keyword.
Throws is a keyword which is used during Exception handling.
It is used whenever we know that Exception error will definitely occur.
When we use BufferedReader, exception error always takes place.
To prevent Exception errors from taking place we make use of throws IOException.
We will learn about Exception Handling in the coming tutorials.
Now, we will create an object of InputStreamReader.
For that, inside the main method type: InputStreamReader space isr equalto new space InputStreamReader parentheses.
Within   parentheses, type: System dot in and then semicolon.
InputStreamReader is a class in java which allows us to take the user  input .
System dot in tells the java compiler to take the input from the user, using keyboard.
The input that System  dot in takes is stored in the object of InputStreamReader for sometime.
After this we create an object of BufferedReader.
So, type: BufferedReader space br equal to new space BufferedReader and then parentheses.
Inside the parentheses, type the object of InputStreamReader which is isr.
Now, isr only helps to take the input from the user.
BufferedReader helps to store the value in the BufferedReader object.
Isr passes this value to the BufferedReader object to store it.
Now, let us start taking input from the user.
We will first ask the user to enter a String. So create a variable of String type.
Type: String space str semicolon.
Now ask the user to enter his name.
So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Enter your name and then semicolon.
To take the input as  String we will type:
str equal to br dot readLine parentheses and then semicolon.
The readLine method will read the input from the user.
Now, let us take the input as an integer. Create a variable of type int.
So, type:  int n  semicolon.
Ask the user to enter his age.
So, type: System dot out dotprintln within brackets and double quotes  Enter your age semicolon.
Also, create another variable named str1 of String type in order to take the input.
Now, to take the input as String, type: str1 equal to br dot readLine parentheses  and then semicolon.
To convert it into integer datatype, type: n equal to Integer with capital I  dot parseInt, capital I within brackets str1 semicolon.
Integer is a class and parseInt is its method.
This method converts the argument passed within the bracket into integer.
Now, let us display the output for  name and age.
So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus str semicolon.
Next line, type: System dot out dot println The age is plus n and then semicolon.
Now,  Save the file, press Ctrl, S keys. Now let us run the program.
So, press Control and F11 keys.
In the output, you are asked to enter your name.
So, type your name. I will type here Ramu,  press Enter.
You will be asked to enter your age.
I will type here 20 and then press Enter.
We get the output as :
The name is  Ramu  And  The age is 20.
Thus, we know how to take an input from the user.
In this tutorial we have learnt :
About InputStreamReader
About BufferedReader And Converting from String to the desired data type.
For self-assessment, take a float, byte and character input from the user and  then display the output.
Also take a number as input and divide it by 3. Then display the output on the console.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Neonatal Childcare.
How to take care of a newborn baby
Common problems faced by a new mother and
How to tackle those problems.
Dr. Anjali enters Anita’s house and expresses her happiness on her newborn child.
Dr. Anjali notices, Anita is holding her baby in a wrong way.
She tells Anita to be careful while carrying the baby.
Dr. Anjali shows her how to support the head of the baby and cradle it
when holding the baby upright or
when laying it down.
The doctor advices Anita to never handle the baby roughly.
Anita tells the doctor that she is new to all this
and asks for her advice on taking better care of her newborn baby.
Dr. Anjali happily agrees.
She points out that first and foremost  important is
to wash your hands with soap or charcoal-ash
before handling the newborn babies.
Young babies have not yet built up a strong immune system.
So, they are susceptible to infections.
Anita asks the doctor: “How often should I feed my baby?”.
The doctor tells Anita that a newborn baby needs to be fed every 2 to 3 hours.
She explains that breastfeeding is most important for the health of the baby and
development of the baby’s immune system.
Also, if you're breastfeeding, give your baby the chance to nurse about 10-15 minutes at each breast.
Then, Anita asks the doctor about formula-feeding the baby.
The lady doctor states that
if you're formula-feeding your baby like for eg:milk-substitutes,
then it will most likely take about 60-90 gms at each feeding.
Anita then asks the doctor about when and how can she give the baby a bath.
The doctor explains that during the first few weeks, the baby is very delicate.
She says that we should give the baby only sponge bath, until
(a) the umbilical cord falls off
(b) the circumcision heals
(c) the navel heals completely.
The doctor explains that after the initial period, 2-3 baths per week with a mild soap are sufficient for the baby.
This can continue during the first year of the baby.
Frequent bathing may be drying to the skin.
Dr. Anjali then points out that the baby has some rashes.
Anita gets scared.
She asks the doctor how to take care of such rashes.
The doctor explains that the rashes are because of the wet diaper.
She further says that you should change your baby's cloth diaper frequently and as soon as possible after bowel movements.
After cleaning the area with mild soap and water, wipe it dry.
Then apply some baby powder over it to keep it moisture-free.
The doctor further explains that if you are using cloth diapers, wash them in hot water with a disinfectant like dettol.
It's also a good idea to let the baby go un-diapered for part of the day.
Anita thanks Dr. Anjali for her advice and says she will keep them in mind.

Welcome to part 4 of User Registration.
We are going through these processes thoroughly.
We are using security and checks for our "username" and "password"  which is really good.
We need to connect to our database first.
We are going to open up our table and input our values.
So, I am going to type "alex" and I am going to choose my username.
Then type my full name and I am going to choose a password which is "abc".
The next one, I will just type a mix of characters.
So, when I click Register, it should say "Your passwords do not match".
So, go back to square one.
We are going to type "Alex Garrett".
We will choose a username. We are going to choose a password say "abc".
Since this is under 6 characters, when I click "Register" - "Passwords must be between 25 and 6 characters".  So  that check works.
Now, what I will type is my fullname as "Alex Garrett" and my 'username' as "alex".
The password is going to be just a full length password.
More than 6 characters. I will click "Register".  You can see that - "Length of the username or fullname is too long!".
So you can write these checks if you want. I'll leave it up to you.
So, at the moment we have now got a successful form validation.
Now, what we will do is continue with registering our user.
Now this form validation isn't good. Every time we get an error, these fields disappear; they are gone.
And the user has to retype.
So what I am going to say is, we have got our fullname, username and password variables here.
Considering this  php page itself, we can incorporate php into this html code over here.
Under your fullname, I am going to say value equal to a value inside the box and open up a php tag.
Close the php tag inside. Here I am going to echo 'username' or rather '$fullname'.
I will do exactly the same with our 'username'.
So value equals open php tags, close php tags and echo out 'username'.
Make sure that line terminator is in there.
Now what will happen is, let's say I choose this ridiculously long name here and I choose a username say "alex".
If you don't want your passwords to be stored, so just leave that up to the user.
I've got a too long username and it should produce this error again.
When I click Register, this time it's kept our fullname and username.
So it's a rule. If you get an error and you have to retype your username, your fullname, your password or your firstname, middle name, your surname; I don't know how many fields are there in your user form.
It's annoying to type your name over and over again.
So using this, your php echo inside php tags, inside the values of your html input type and it is so useful and so much more convenient for the user and much more user friendly.
Okay, otherwise echo "Success!!".  I have not actually given a successful form yet.
So, I will type "Alex Garret" and my password is going to be over 6 characters and under 25 characters.
Click "Register".  Oh! an error message.  Let's see.
We have picked up an error and.... - if the string length of the password is greater than 25
...or the string length of the password is lesser than 6.... echo password - should be enough.... but we have run into the same problem.
I have just realized that we have an encrypted value for our password and our md5 encrypted string is massive. It's much bigger than 25 characters.
So again what I have to do is, take this block of code that has been encrypting our page. Cut out that and bring it down underneath "register the user".
So you can see from experience that order of things is very important. If you get errors like this go through your code. Look at them and realize what are you doing.
Use echo things out in between your code, just as sort of debug process.
Now I will go back to my form and I'm going to retype my perfectly acceptable password in.
Click on "Register". We have got our "Success" message.
So you see, going through your code helps to see if there are problems.
I am a bit quick at realizing these.  But sometimes I  pause video, I have a look at the code and then resume the video. I don't like to keep the viewers on hold.
So, you too will soon realize your mistakes. So we have got our "Success" and now we will say "open our database".
To do this, we need our connect variable, no you don't... I am saying my "sql connect()".
And I am connecting to my "local host" server which is my computer and "root" and my password is nothing.
I am going to say "mySQL select db()". This is going to select our database. So let's say "select data base"
even though this is obvious. This is "php login" and here I am going to say give a query.
So "query register" is going to be equal to "mysql_query()".
This is the important part of the tutorial where we actually input our values and we register our username.
Now let me scroll down so you can see this  is "INSERT INTO users".
If we go back to here, this is it "php login" is our table that we have selected. So "mySQL select db php login".
And we are inserting into "users" which is our table in the database.
And we will say "VALUES" brackets, each value of the table. So each field  is present in the table.
So, if we go back to here and click on Browse or Structure - that one - we got id, name, username, password, date. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Here also we need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The id is auto-increment, if you know from the last tutorial.
So we just need in here; the order is very important.
We have got our name, username, password, date. So this is just 'name', 'username'.
This is 'password', no need to repeat password, that was just for check and this is going to be the 'date'.
So these variables here, if you are not so sure, are up from here where we have our 'fullname', 'username', 'password' and 'date'.
Let's change this to 'fullname'. Okay, so this should work. After this is done I will say, "You have been registered". In fact, what I am going to do is I say die().
Put this as a link back to out 'index page' in which the user could login.
As you can see how it executes in a second and here is my previous page.
Let's say "Alex Garret". Choosing username as "alex" and this as your password. "You have been registered!". Return to login page".
Now, I will now check my database in Browse". You can see that I have got "Alex Garret". My "id" is 3, my "username" is "alex",
my password is my encrypted password and my "date" is this.
That's it. So, in the next part I will show you how to tidy a few things out and test the login process.
So I'll see you there.  This is Sidharth, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on “Overview of Drupal”.
First, let us understand what is Drupal. Drupal is a free and open source, Content Management System (CMS).
What is a CMS?
In the traditional way, each webpage has its own html file.
Now it is very different.
Each of the component can come from different places.
These components are assembled on the fly, using some programming logic.
So, depending on where you are viewing, say a desktop or a mobile, it could be different.
It can also change depending on who is viewing it from where.
or a customer buying something from Singapore.
CMS is the program behind this presentation logic.
It uses various programming functionalities such as PHP, Ajax, Javascript etc.
All CMS usually use a database to store information content without any formatting.
The formatting of content is done separately.
CMS makes even non-technical users to manage a website easily.
Drupal is one such CMS that is open source, meaning the code is freely available.
Anybody can download and change it.
Drupal was founded in 2000 by Dries Buytaert, when he was a student.
Since making it open source, several thousands of people have helped in modifying the code.
They then give it back to the community with small improvements.
Drupal community is one of the largest and closely knit open source community.
This community has developers, site-builders, volunteers who make Drupal what it is today.
It is said that in Drupal, you “Come for the code, stay for the community”.
May be, you will stick to the community for the same reason.
Let me list out the top 10 features of Drupal.
Number 1:
Anybody can download the source code and modify it.
Even if you’re a developer, Drupal is very useful.
Number 2:
Drupal is one of the most adaptive systems available today.
Drupal works well with sophisticated websites that require many different custom data structures.
Developers use it as both CMS and as a broader web development platform.
Number 3:
We can view and administer every page on our Drupal site, from any mobile device we choose.
Number 4:
From the whitehouse.gov to weather.com and Dallas Cowboys, Drupal can handle any project.
Drupal shines with more complex websites.
It’s one of the best solutions for people who want to build a feature rich website.
And it’s also highly suitable for large enterprises.
Number 5:
Drupal helps people find my site and my content.
Also, Drupal allows site editors to add tags, descriptions, keywords and human-friendly URLs.
Number 6:
Drupal keeps our site safe with regular security updates, hash passwords,
session IDs that change when permissions change,
Text format permissions restricting user input and a lot more.
Drupal takes security very seriously.
Number 7:
Think of any feature and somebody has mostly built a Module and made it available free.
We can have multiple Themes or versions of a Theme on the same site.
Number 8:
There are Drupal events all over the world.
Local events are called Drupal camps.
And every year, there are major DrupalCons all around the world.
There are very active Forums, User Groups and IRC chats dedicated to Drupal support.
Number 9:
Acquia, partner for this series, is the largest Drupal company.
In India, there are more than sixty Drupal service companies. There are also hundreds of freelancers who know Drupal.
Number 10:
Drupal runs 3 percent of the entire web and 15 percent of the top ten thousand websites.
Drupal is highly popular with governments, education, non-profits and large enterprises.
In this tutorial series, we will learn the following topics-
We will show you how to install Drupal and other associated software.
Almost anybody can do this, you need not be Linux or Windows administration savvy for this.
The content workflow-
We will also create a simple website content as though you are editing it in a word processor.
Then we will learn some of the powerful features that make Drupal unique.
They are relationships between content, programmatic formatted display of several contents and so on.
How to extend Drupal-
As mentioned before, there is a Module, like an app, for almost any feature you require.
Given that there are tens of thousands of Modules, we will show you how to select a Module for your purpose.
How to layout the site-
In the layout part, we will learn how easy it is to change the look and feel of the website.
Like Modules, the layout or Themes are also available as community contributions.
How to manage people-
Unlike other single user oriented CMS, such as WordPress, Drupal is often used in situations where different users to do different things in the website.
In people management part, we will learn how to set up different roles and give them different permissions.
How to properly manage the site;
It is important to keep the site updated for security and stability.
It is also helpful to get new features to make the site more user friendly.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Fill Objects with Color in LibreOffice Draw.
Fill objects with color, gradients, hatching and bitmaps
Set page backgrounds
Create new colors.
Let us begin by opening the file WaterCycle.
You can fill objects with:* Colors* Gradients
Line patterns or hatching and * Pictures.
Here, we are using:Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
Let us color the WaterCycle diagram.
Let’s begin by coloring the two clouds next to the sun. We shall fill them with white.
Select the cloud next to the sun.
Right-click to view the context menu and click Area.
The Area dialog-box is displayed.
Click the Area tab and under the Fill option, select Color.
Scroll down and click on White.
In the same way, we will colour the other cloud too.
Right-click under Area, Color and White.
Coloring each cloud will take a long time.
An easier way to do this is to group them.
Let’s color the other two clouds  in gray as they are rain-bearing clouds.
First let’s group them.
Press the Shift key and click the first cloud and then click on the second.
Right-click for the context menu and click Group.
The clouds are now grouped.
Again, right-click for the context menu and click Area.
In the Area dialog-box, click the Area tab. Under the Fill option, select Color and scroll down and click on the colour Gray 70%.
Let’s color the triangle brown 3 in the same way.
Now, let’s color the rectangle in brown 4 in the same way, again.
Similarly, let's colour the sun yellow.
Next, let’s color the other triangle and curve that represents water with the colour turquoise 1.
As they require the same formatting, let’s group them if they are not already grouped.
To color them, let’s follow the same steps as in the previous ones - right-click, Area -> Area tab -> Fill -> color -> turquoise 1.
Observe that in the object water, the outlines of the triangle and the curve are  displayed.
Let’s make these outlines invisible so that the picture looks better.
Select the object, right-click to view the context menu and click Line.
The Line dialog-box is displayed.
Click the Line tab .
In Line properties, click on the Style drop-down box and select Invisible.
The outline of water object becomes invisible.
Now, let us color the trees.
Let us select the left-most tree.
Right-click to view the context-menu and click on Enter Group.
Now, let’s edit the tree.
Select the leaves on the right.
Right-click for the context menu and click Area.
In the  Area dialog-box,
click the Area tab.
Under Fill, select Color.
Scroll down and click on Green 5.
Let us do the same for the leaves on the left.
Let’s color the trunk of the tree next.
Select the Y-shaped arrow, right-click for the context menu and click Area.
Notice that all the previous selections are retained in the Area dialog-box.
So, let's  select Color.
Scroll down and click on Brown 1.
We have colored the tree!
To exit the group, right-click and select Exit Group.
We can color the other trees in the same way.
We can also delete the other trees, copy-paste the colored tree and move it to the desired location.
It is much easier this way, isn’t it?
Now, let us add a shadow to the cloud next  to the Sun.
Let’s click Select from the Drawing toolbar to select and then group them.
Select the white cloud group and right-click for the context menu and click Area.
In the Area dialog-box, click the Shadow tab.
In Properties, check the Use Shadow box.
The other fields now become active.
In Position, click the bottom-right corner option.
“Position” defines where the shadow will appear.
In the Color field, select Gray.
A shadow is displayed behind each white cloud.
Now, let’s make the clouds look more realistic.
Select the gray cloud group and right-click to view the context menu and select Area.
In the “Area” dialog-box, select Area tab. Under Fill, click Gradient.
Now select Gradient1.
The cloud now has a more realistic shade of gray!
Select a shape - say a cloud group.  Right-click for the context menu and click Area.
The Area tab options are visible.
Under Fill, you will see the 4 options -
Color, Gradient, Hatching and Bitmap.
Notice that there is a corresponding tab in the dialog-box for each of these options.
These tabs allow us to create and save new styles.
Let’s click on the Colors tab.
Under Properties, let’s select Red 3 from the Color drop-down.
Then, select RGB and enter the values for 'R', 'G' and 'B' as shown.
R, G and B stand for the proportion of Red, Green and Blue in any color.
We will enter 200 for R, 100 for G and 50 for B.
Here we are changing the proportion of red, green and blue to change the color.
Look at the preview box, above the RGB field.
The first preview box displays the original color.
The second preview box, next to the Color field, shows the changes that we made.
Let’s type a name for this, in the Name field.
Let’s enter the name New red.
The new color is added to the list.
We have created a new color!
Let’s undo this action by pressing Ctrl and Z.
The colour of the cloud reverts to white, again.
You can create your own gradients and hatching too, using the tabs in the Area dialog-box.
Gradients are shades that blend from one color to the other.
For example, the color shade moves from blue to green.
Hatching is a shading or texture in drawing that is created using fine parallel lines.
Now, let’s learn how to import a bitmap into Draw.
From the Main menu, select Format and click Area.
As seen earlier, the Area dialog-box opens. Click on the Bitmaps tab.
Now, click on the Import button.
The Import dialog-box appears.
Browse and select a bitmap.
Click on the  Open button.
Draw prompts you to enter a name for the Bitmap.
Let’s enter the name NewBitmap.
The Bitmap now appears in the drop-down list.
Click OK to exit.
Observe the clouds now.
Let’s undo this by pressing Ctrl and Z keys.
Let us use bitmaps to fill the object “water”.
Now, let us make the water look more realistic.
To do this, select the grouped triangle and curve.
Right-click for the context menu and select Area.
In the Area dialog-box, click the Bitmaps tab.
Scroll down the list of bitmaps and select Water.
The water looks more realistic now!
Draw objects and fill them with color, gradients, hatching and bitmaps.
Use the Transparency tab and see its effects on the objects.
Let’s color the sky now. This is simple!
We just apply a background to the whole page.
Click the cursor on the page to ensure no objects are selected.
Right-click for the context menu.
Click Page and select Page setup. The Page setup  dialog-box is displayed.
Click the Background tab and under Fill,  select Color.
Let’s scroll down  and select the color Blue 8.
Draw asks you if this background setting should be for all pages.
Click NO.
Now only the selected page has a background color.
You can also choose not to fill the object with any color.
Let us select the mountain.
Right-click for the context menu and select Area.
In the Area dialog-box, select the Area tab.
Under Fill, select None.
The object is not filled with any color and only the outline is seen against the background.
To undo the action, press Ctrl+Z keys.
You can also access all these options from the Format menu.
Remember to save your file by pressing Ctrl+S keys together, every time you make a change.
Alternately, set the Automatic Save option so that the changes are saved automatically.
Color this picture you created.
Give a background to the page.
Create some new colors.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on LibreOffice Draw.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to use color, gradients, hatching and bitmaps to:
Fill objects
Create backgrounds and
Create new styles.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Working with Objects in LibreOffice Draw.
Position objects using Grids and Guide lines,
Use snap functions,
Customize lines and arrowheads.
You will also learn how to: Duplicate objects,
Re-size objects exactly,
Distribute objects, Combine, merge, subtract and intersect objects.
We are using:Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
What are Grids?
Grids aid to position objects,
accurately on the Draw page.
Let us open the file RouteMap that was saved on the Desktop.
In the previous tutorials, we had briefly used grids.
Now, let us learn about grids in detail.
From the Main menu, select View and click on Grid.
Then click on Display Grid.
The Draw page is filled with a number of horizontal and vertical dotted lines. These form the grid.
These grids are for display purposes only. They will not be printed.
We can customize the size of the grids, that is, make them smaller or bigger as required.
From the Main menu, select Tools and click Options.
Click LibreOffice Draw and select Grid.
Under Resolution, enter the following values:
Horizontal – 7 cm
Vertical – 5 cm.
Subdivision decides the number of spaces in a grid.
Let us enter Subdivision values.
Horizontal – 3
Vertical – 4.
Let us leave the Synchronize axes option unchecked.
Look at the Draw page now. Look at the size of each box in the grid.
Let us count the spaces that we set in the Subdivision.
Horizontally there are 1, 2, 3 spaces and vertically there are 1, 2, 3, 4 spaces.
Let us learn about Guides.
What are Guides?
Guides are helper lines or extensions of the edges of the objects
that are displayed when it is moved.
Let us enable the guidelines.
Go to the Main menu, select View and select the option Guides.
Now, click the option Display Guides.
From the Main menu, click Tools and Options.
The Options dialog-box appears.
From the left panel, click on the small black triangle next to LibreOffice Draw. Click View.
From the right panel, select Guides when moving. This way, you can see the guides when moving objects.
Now, let us move the park a little to the right.
When the park is moved, the extension lines of the edges of the object become visible. These are the Guidelines.
What are Snap Lines?
Snap Lines help us position two or more objects within an area that is defined.
Snap lines and Snap points are created by the user.
Snap lines run vertically and horizontally and appear as dashed lines.
You must enable the Snap Lines option before you create snap lines.
Go to the Draw page. Right-click for the context menu and select Snap Lines.
Now, check all the three options:
Snap Lines Visible,
Snap to Snap Lines,
Snap Lines to Front.
Snap lines that we create, will now be visible.
Let’s define an area, using Snap Lines, within which the objects in the map must fall (as shown in the slide).
Move the mouse cursor over the vertical ruler.
Press the left-mouse-button.
You will notice that the cursor is now shaped like a two-sided arrow.
Drag the mouse towards the Draw page.
You will see a dotted line.
Do not release the mouse-button.
Holding the left-mouse-button, drag the dotted line to the page.
Now, release the mouse-button.
Can you see the line?
This is the Snap Line.To create the bottom most limit, simply drag the line to the bottom of the page.
Let’s create three more Snap Lines to define the area within which the map is enclosed.
We have created horizontal and vertical Snap Lines.
Now you can position the objects along these Snap Lines.
You can, of course, create as many Snap Lines as you want.
The horizontal and vertical Snap Lines function like the 'X' and 'Y' axes on a  graph.
Within these two axes, you can position objects exactly.
You can use the Snap function along with the grid lines to position objects accurately.
You can also: Snap to Grid-  position an object exactly on grid points
Snap to Snap lines - position an object exactly on a snap line
Snap to Page margin - position an object exactly on the page margin.
Explore all the Grid options.
Check what happens to objects when you snap to Grid, snap lines and page margins.
Now let’s add one more lake, in the exact shape of this lake, next to the School Campus.
To do this, let’s use the Duplicate option.
Let’s select the Lake.
Go to the Main menu', select Edit and click on Duplicate.
In Number of copies, enter the value 1 and click OK.
The Lake is duplicated.
Let’s drag the lake and place it near the school.
Objects can also be re-sized exactly to any measurement that is required.
Let’s use the exact measurements and change the shape of the House as shown in this slide.
Let’s give it the same height and width and slant its corners and rotate it.
First, select Home, right-click for the context menu and select Position and Size.
The Position and Size  dialog-box appears.
Click the Position and Size tab.
Under Size, enter the value 3 in both the Width and Height fields.
Then click the Rotation tab.
In the Angle field, enter the value 10.
Finally, select the Slant and Corner Radius tab.
In the Slant Angle field, enter 5 degrees.
We have re-designed the house!
# Draw various shapes using the Drawing tool bar.
# Check if you can apply Corner radius to all shapes.
Now, let’s space the right edges of some objects evenly.
We will use the Distribution option to achieve this.
We must select at least three objects  to use the Distribution option.
First, select the Residential Complex, the Parking Lot and the Commercial Complex.
Let’s group them by dragging the Select arrow to cover all the objects.
Now, right-click and select Distribution.
Under Horizontal, select Right.  Click OK.
The right edges of the objects will be distributed evenly.
The Distribution option does not distribute the objects horizontally or vertically.
The Horizontal Distribution option distributes-
The right and left edges
The horizontal centers and
The spacing of the objects.
The Vertical option distributes-
The top and bottom edges,
Now, let’s create our own line style for this map.
From the Main menu, select Format and click Line.
The Line dialog-box appears.
Click on the Line Styles tab.
In Line Styles, select the option Three dashes and three dots.
Leave the Type field as it is.
In Number, let’s enter 10 and 5; Length as  8%.
Click Add. Enter the name "My Line Style". Click OK.
Again click OK.
Let’s select this arrow. Right-click and select Line. The Line dialog-box appears.
Click the Line tab.
Click on the Style drop-down box.
It now displays the new style that was created.
Select it and click OK.
We have created a new line style!
Let’s draw a small stadium to the left of the School Campus.
From the Drawing toolbar, click Basic Shapes and select a Circle.
Let’s enter it in the Draw page.
The outline of the circle is of the style My Line Style.
Let’s type “Stadium” inside it.
Now, let’s learn to combine, merge, subtract and intersect objects.
What is the difference between Grouping and combining objects?
When objects are grouped, a number of objects are just put together.
When objects are combined, new object is created.
We will use three objects to demonstrate these options.
First, let us add a new page to the Draw file.
Let’s draw a circle from the Drawing toolbar- click Basic Shapes and select Circle.
Move the mouse in the Draw page and drag it down.
Let’s  draw a second object  Diamond.
From the Drawing toolbar, click Basic Shapes and select  Diamond.
Move  the cursor  to  the Draw page, drag it  down. And from the menu bar, select Area Style / Filling drop down button and select color Red 3.
Draw a  third object, a Rectangle, and color the object as Green 6.
Select the three objects by holding down the Shift key and clicking on each object.
Right-click for the Context menu and click Combine.
A new object is created!
Notice that the new object takes the color of the object that is last and at the back.
Let us undo this action by pressing the CTRL+Z keys together.
Select the figures again and right-click for the context menu.
Select Shapes and click Merge.
Another new shape is created!
Remember the more you experiment with these functions, the more you will learn.
In this tutorial, you have learnt how to use Grids, Guides and snap lines to align objects accurately.
You have also learnt to Duplicate, Resize objects and distribute objects.
We also created new line styles and learnt how to form new objects using-
Combine, Merge, Subtract, Intersect.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Testing and debugging.
In this tutorial, you will,  Understand what is software testing
Test simple functions for their functionality
Automate tests
Understand the need for coding style and Learn some of the standards followed by the Python Community
Python 3.4.3
IPython 5.1.0 and Gedit text editor
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to use functions.
First we will learn about software testing.
Software testing is the process to evaluate the functionality of a software or a program.
It helps to find whether the program met the specified requirements or not.
It ensures a defect free program so that we will get a quality program.
All the codes used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link of this tutorial.
You should download in the current working directory and use them.
Open any text editor and type the following code.
This is a simple function to calculate gcd of two numbers.
We need a set of inputs for the variable a and b.
Save the file as find underscore gcd.py in the current working directory.
Next we will open the file test underscore gcd.py.
Let our test case be 48 and 64 as a and b.
For this test case we know that the GCD is 16. So that is the expected output.
Let us now run the script and test our code.
Open the terminal and type python3 test underscore gcd.py
We get the output as Test Passed which means our code is correct.
But there can be a number of cases where the gcd function might break.
So, to check where our code is breaking we should run many tests.
This is where the concept of automating tests comes in.
Let us first try and automate tests on the gcd function.
Open the file textcases.txt where the various testing parameters are given.
The structure of the file will have two input parameters.
The third parameter is the correct output result. We have separated the elements by a space.
Next let us open the file automate underscore test underscore gcd.py
First we need import gcd function from find underscore gcd in order to use it for testing.
Next the testcases.txt file is read line by line.
The first two input parameters are assigned to the variables x and y.
The third parameter which is the correct output value is assigned to the variable result.
We check whether the value returned by the gcd function is equal to the value in the variable result.
Finally it prints the message accordingly.
In the terminal, type python3 automate underscore test underscore gcd.py
As you can see, all the three test cases in testcases.txt are passed.
The value calculated by the gcd function is equal to the output value provided in the testcases.txt.
For the same inputs as gcd write automated tests for LCM.
Use the data from the file lcmtestcases.txt
Switch to the terminal for the solution.
Let us see the code to calculate lcd of two numbers.
This is the data file for the lcm test cases.
This file name is lcmtestcases.txt
Note that both these files should be in the current working directory.
Let us now run the script and test our code.
Type python3 find underscore lcm.py
Here, the third test case failed. Because the corresponding input in lcmtestcases.txt is incorrect.
This is to check the behavior of the program on incorrect conditions.
A good program should be readable. So others can extend and improve it.
Code is read more often than it is written.
We choose a name so that it becomes easier to understand its usage.
As we can see in the example, it is very easy to understand what the code is doing.
Proper naming helps so much in understanding the code.
Also one should keep in mind the following things while writing a code in Python.
Four Space Indentation
79 characters limit on a line
Functions and methods should be separated with two blank lines.
Use Docstring to document a specific segment of code.
Use whitespace around operators and after punctuations.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
Automate tests using many predefined test cases and Use python coding standards.
Here is a self assessment question for you to solve
What is the proper indentation for python code according to the style guidelines?
And the answer,  Four Space Indentation is required for writing a python code according to the style guidelines.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Creating Basic Content.
First, let us learn about Content type. In Drupal, Content type is the core of the content management system.
It is like the backbone of a site.
It is one of the things that sets Drupal apart from the other CMS.
Most of the CMS just have a title and a body and that as it turns out, is completely inadequate.
In Drupal, every content item is called a node. Each node belongs to a single Content type.
Next, let us understand the importance of Content type. Content type defines various default settings for nodes of that type such as-
whether the node is published automatically whether the comments are permitted and
how content gets added to our site. Every Content type has fields.
We have fields for information that we need, depending on what kind of content is going in.
Let me illustrate it this way. This is IMDb.Com which could be a Drupal site. This is about the movie Red.
On the screen, you will see -
a parental rating,a run time,a movie genre,
a body or a description for the movie.
We will have a set of people fields as well as some other links and buttons and things.
In other CMSs we could use something like Dreamweaver to create this layout in CSS.
What happens if we want-
If you are using another CMS, it is difficult to do this. But in Drupal, it is done very easily.
This is the real advantage of Content types. Now, let us go and explore some built-in Content types.
Later, we will also learn about creating new Content types. Open our Drupal site which we created earlier.
First, we will learn about Article Content type. Click on Content and then on Add content.
Remember, we have already created one article. We will now create another article with all the elements.
Click on Article. In an article, there’s only one mandatory field, i.e. the Title.
If we don’t put text in the body, we will have nothing. An Article Content type comes with the Summary.
If we don't put anything in the Summary, Drupal will take the first few characters to create it. This is called the Teaser mode.
Let’s proceed. We will type a few lines of text here.
You can type any text that you want.
This is my text.
Here, Text format shows what elements we are allowed to put into the HTML.
We have Basic, Restricted and Full HTML. Because we are the super user, we can see everything.
Normally, when a user logs in as an editor or publisher, there is only one Text format here.
For more details, click on About text formats link.
For now, let's select Basic HTML.
Basic HTML allows us to look at the source code and use some basic HTML elements like-
a paragraph tag, strong italic,
unordered list, ordered list and a few others.
Full HTML allows us to embed any HTML  including JavaScript and iframes.
In Restricted HTML, we will just be allowed to enter something like a paragraph tag or line breaks.
The WYSIWYG editor is CKEditor. We will learn about it later.
Here we can see bold, italics, linking, unordered and ordered lists, block quote and image.
A formatting drop down to choose different H tags and then View Source.
When I change the Text format, I get more buttons. We will learn about them later.
Let's leave it at Basic HTML, for now. Click on Continue button.
Let's finish our article. Once again, let's use the tags - "introduction" and "drupal".
We will leave the Image blank for now. You have already seen how that works.
Here, on the right, we get the visibility and publication settings.
Click on Create new revision check-box to enable version control for this particular article.
If we want to add an article to a menu link, click on Provide a menu link check-box. Drupal will add a menu item to the Main navigation.
If you do that, we will get hundreds of mails. So, let’s remove the check mark.
We can turn Comments ON or OFF on a particular node.
Here we can give the URL alias.
If kept blank, then Drupal will create this for us.
Under AUTHORING INFORMATION, we can see who created this node and when they created it.
Under PROMOTION OPTIONS, we can set the view settings like-
These are set up when we create our Content type and the editor doesn't need to change those.
But we can make changes as per our preferences.
Finally, click Save and publish to save our node.
Immediately, the node is live on our site. We can see it here.
Click on Home page.
We have our "Welcome to Drupalville" and "Drupalville's Second Article".
In Teaser mode, these are displayed in publication date order.
The Read more and Add new comment links are here.
To get a list of all the nodes tagged with the word Drupal, click on drupal link.
Again, the nodes are displayed in publication date order.
That's the Article Content type.
Let us click on Edit link.
We can insert anything we want here.
Drupal gives a lot of options, by default.
Let us click on Save and keep published.
We can use Content types for anything.
Let's add another item. Click on Shortcuts and Add content.
Choose Basic page. Basic page contains the Title and the Body.
There are no tags or images. It is not "Promoted to the front page", by default.
Also, there is no provision for commenting. Because it’s not promoted to the Home page, it's easy to create a new menu.
Type: "About Drupalville".
Type some text of your choice here.
Now, check the Provide a menu link under MENU SETTINGS.
You will see that the Title changes to a Menu Title.
We could shorten this, if we want. Check it in the Main navigation and keep the Weight at 0, for now.
Weight is where the menu will appear in the list. A lower number or negative number will make it appear higher i.e. it will flow to the top.
Leave everything else the same. Make sure menu link is checked and click Save and publish.
We get an About Drupalville link. It will take us to our Basic page Content type with a node title About Drupalville.
The node ID shows 3. If you have added other nodes earlier, then your node ID might be different from mine.
At the bottom left, we can see this is node ID 3. You won’t need that very often, however.
That is the article and the Basic page Content type with a menu link. With this we come to the end of this tutorial.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Magnetism and Electromagnetism.
At the end of this tutorial you will be able to,
Draw magnetic field lines for a bar magnet.
Verify right hand thumb rule.
Verify Fleming's left hand and right hand rules.
Simulate the working of a generator.
Here I am using,
Firefox web browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For the pre-requisites tutorials please visit this site.
In this tutorial we will use, Magnetic Field of a Bar Magnet
Magnetic Field of a Straight Current-Carrying Wire
Lorentz Force and  Generator Apps.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
Right click on magneticfieldbar_en.htm file.
Select Open With Firefox web Browser option.
Magnetic field bar App opens.
The App opens showing a magnet and a magnetic needle.
On the green panel there are two buttons.
Poles of a bar magnet and compass needle are represented by the following colors.
Red for north pole and green for south pole.
Click on Turn magnet button.
Observe that both bar magnet and magnetic needle change their direction.
Let us draw the magnetic field lines.
Click on the magnetic needle and move the needle up and down to draw the magnetic lines.
Continue to draw the lines as shown here.
Click on the Clear field lines button.
Click on Turn magnet button.
Again draw the magnetic lines around the magnet.
When we turn the magnet, the lines of force change the direction.
The direction of magnetic field outside the bar magnet is from north to south.
Magnetic field is strongest inside the bar magnet.
Outside the bar magnet it is strongest near the poles.
What is the direction of magnetic field inside the bar magnet?
Next we will move on to Magnetic Field Line in a Current Carrying Wire App.
Right click on magneticfieldwire_en.htm file.
Select Open with Firefox Web browser option.
The App opens showing magnetic field lines around a current carrying wire.
On the right side of the screen we have a Reverse current button.
The red arrow indicates the direction of the current.
The signs at the end of the wire symbolizes the terminals of the connected battery.
The concentric circles are the magnetic field around the current carrying wire.
Let us find the direction of magnetic field using right hand thumb rule.
Observe the picture and put your right hand as follows.
Put your right hand thumb in the direction of the current.
Now curl your fingers inside.
Fingers gives you the direction of magnetic field.
Let us move on to the next App, Lorentz Force.
Follow the same steps as we used for previous App to open htm file.
Interface shows a horseshoe magnet through which a conducting wire is passed.
The blue arrows shows the direction of the magnetic field.
On the green panel we have the following buttons.
When the circuit is open, the wire is shown in black colour.
Click on the On/Off button to complete the circuit.
Notice that the wire is in conduction mode.
This is indicated by the red coloured wire.
At the bottom, there are three check-boxes.
The black arrow pointing towards right is the Lorentz force.
Lorentz force is always perpendicular to the magnetic field.
To change the direction of magnetic field, click on the Turn magnet button.
Let us verify the direction of Lorentz force using Fleming’s left-hand rule.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to restart the App.
First uncheck the Lorentz force check-box.
Click on On/Off button.
Now keep your fingers of the left hand as suggested here.
Index finger pointing in the direction of magnetic field. Middle finger pointing in the direction of current.
Thumb shows the direction of Lorentz force.
Here the direction of Force is towards the right-side.
Let us verify our answer by checking the Lorentz force check-box.
Observe that the direction is same as shown in the App.
As an assignment
Determine the direction of lorentz force using Fleming’s left hand rule.
Now let us open the Generator App.
I will open the App as before.
The App shows a generator.
An electrical generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
The App opens showing a horseshoe magnet.
A rectangular current carrying coil is inserted between the poles of the magnet.
On the green panel, we can change the rotations per minute using the slider.
By default the rectangular coil rotates 6 rotations per minute.
We can change the rotation of the coil to a maximum of 12 rotations per minute.
Increase the rotation to 12 rotations per minute.
In the graph we can see two complete cycles in one minute.
Here the frequency of the maximum output voltage is doubled.
The rectangular coil is connected to the voltage source through the slip rings.
Observe that the rectangular coil is rotating about an axis.
Here rotation of the rectangular coil is a source of mechanical energy.
Due to the rotation of the coil, current is induced into the wire.
The red arrow represents the direction of the induced current.
In the green panel we can choose an AC generator or DC generator.
By default Without commutator an AC generator is selected.
Select With commutator radio button.
Commutator is a device for reversing the direction of flow of current.
This device ensures that the current flows only in direct current mode.
Hence With Commutator means, the generator is a DC generator.
On the top of the circuit, voltage v/s time graph is plotted.
This is the graph of a DC generator.
In the graph, moving blue point indicates the change in voltage.
Change direction button changes the direction of the rectangular coil.
Click on the Change direction button.
Observe the change in the direction of rectangular coil.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to restart the App.
We can find the direction of induced current using Fleming’s right-hand rule.
This rule is same as Fleming’s left-hand rule.
Click on the Pause button.
Now arrange fingers of your right hand as shown in the figure.
We can determine the direction of magnetic field using Fleming's right hand rule.
There are three check-boxes at the bottom of the green panel.
Direction of movement, Magnetic field and Induced current.
Uncheck the Magnetic field check-box.
In the similar way we can uncheck the remaining check-boxes if not required.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to restart the App.
AC generator is an alternating current generator.
So, here the graph shows positive as well as negative voltages.
Note the changes in the movement of the coil and graph.
Let us summarise
Using these Apps we have,
Verified right hand thumb rule.
Verified Fleming's left hand and right hand rules.
Simulated the working of a generator.
These Apps were created by Walter Fendt and his team.

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Phrase Tags in HTML
In this tutorial we will learn:
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or Text Editor and web browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using  Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS
gedit Text Editor and  Firefox web browser
However you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
It is always a good practice to write comments when we write any code.
It helps us to understand the written code.
It enables us to write documentation of a program inside the code itself.
It helps us to debug the code easily.
It also helps us to skip a snippet of code without executing it.
This is the syntax to write a comment in HTML.
HTML comments are placed in between these tags.
Any content that is between these tags will be treated as comment.
And it will be completely ignored or skipped by the browser at the time of execution.
Let us switch to the editor window and write a few comments.
I have already created an HTML file named MySamplePage.html.
And I have saved this file in the my-html folder on my machine.
The same file is also available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page.
This is how the output looks like.
Go to the editor window.
Next to the body tag type the following.
This is a single line comment.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Observe that there are no changes.
This is because, the comment written inside the code did not get executed.
It is also possible to write multiline comments in our code.
Let us now learn how to do that.
Switch to the editor window
In the code, before the bold tag, type the begin comment tag,
Less than symbol exclamation hyphen hyphen
Then, before the body closing tag type the close comment tag,
Note that the multiline comment starts here and ends here.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Look at the output carefully.
Recall, this is because the codes written in between the comment tags are not executed.
Let us come back to the editor window and undo the multiline comment.
Save the file.
Next we will look at some phrase tags that are used in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn to use the following phrase tags-
Strong,  Emphasized,  Marked,  Abbreviation,
Quote,  Cite ,  Pre  and  Code
All these tags have a start and an end tag.
We will look at all these tags one by one.
Switch to the editor window.
Create a new HTML file named MyPage.html, with the code as shown here.
The same file is also available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page.
Come to the 2nd line inside the body section.
Here, I have used the abbreviation tag for the word HTML.
Inside the abbr start tag, I have mentioned HTML abbreviation in the title attribute.
Next in the paragraph section, I have written the text first paragraph within the mark tag.
A few lines below, I have used Strong Text inside the strong tag.
And I have used Emphasised Text inside the em tag.
Switch to the folder where we have saved the file.
Right click on mypage.html
Here in the 1st line we can see that the word HTML is underlined.
We can see a tooltip with the abbreviation of HTML.
Next, the words first paragraph is highlighted.
Also notice that the words Strong Text is in bold and the words Emphasised text is in italic.
We have used strong tag and em tag in the code.
So the output shows the strong tag content in bold and the em tag content in italic.
The output of strong and bold and emphasize and italic tags are identical.
Bold and Italic tags are used to format the presentation.
Whereas Strong and emphasize tags gives more importance to the content.
These will also be helpful in Search Engine Optimization.
Switch to the editor window.
We can quote and cite the content with the help of q and cite tags respectively.
Here I have quoted a sentence and cited a website link for this section.
Switch to the browser.
Note that the quoted sentence is displayed inside the quotes.
To quote a sentence from a different source we have to use blockquote tag.
Note that we have to scroll through the width of the page, to view the entire sentence.
To avoid this scroll, I need to provide a break in this sentence.
Any guesses on which tag to use here?
No, We have to use pre tag.
Switch to the editor window.
Here we can see that I have used the pre tag for this section.
Let me break the sentence after the word creating.
Press Enter key on the keyboard to bring the remaining words to the next line.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Observe the change in the output now.
pre tag helps us to display a program code on a web page.
It can be any programming language code.
For this, we have to use the code tag.
It helps in defining a snippet of code.
Else the browser will consider this as normal text.
Switch to the editor window.
Here inside our HTML code, I have written a simple C program inside the code tag.
I have written this code block inside the pre tag to maintain the indentations.
If you know C programming, you will note that there is a bug in the 1st line.
ampersand l t semi-colon and ampersand g t semi-colon  instead of less than and greater than symbol.
In HTML some characters are reserved.
The browser will consider those characters as a part of HTML syntax
We can use these reserved characters in the content in the form of HTML Entity.
The name or number of the entities have to be written in between ampersand and semicolon symbols.
Here are some common HTML entities which we use regularly.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to add Comments in HTML.
We also learnt about the following phrase tags used in HTML.
Comments,  Strong text ,  Emphasized text ,  Marked text
Abbreviation, Quote, Cite , Pre tag, Code tag,  Entities
As an assignment-  Open the file MyHomePage.html which you created earlier.
Write a C program within this file as shown below.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Variables in Ruby.
What is a variable? Dynamic typing in Ruby
Declaring a variable
Converting variable types
What is variable's scope?
Types of variables.
Here, we are using: Ubuntu Linux version 12.04, Ruby 1.9.3
To follow this tutorial, you must have the knowledge of using Terminal in Linux.
You must also be familiar with "irb".
Now, I will explain you what a variable is.
Variable is used to store a value.
Variable is a reference that can be assigned.
Please note that Ruby variables are case sensitive.
Variable names should be meaningful.
Variable name may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, underscores.  Ex : first_name
Now, let us see what is dynamic typing.
Ruby is a dynamic typed language.
It means that you don't need to declare datatype while creating a variable.
Ruby interpreter determines the datatype at the time of assignment.
Now, let us see how to declare a variable in Ruby.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously.
Now, type "irb" and
press Enter to launch Interactive Ruby.
Now, type: var1 equal to 10  and press Enter.
Here, we have declared a variable var1 and assigned a value 10  to it.
Let's check whether the datatype allotted by the interpreter is  integer or not.
So, type: var1  dot  kind_(underscore)of (?)question mark Integer and press Enter.
We get the output as "true".
In Ruby, you can dynamically change the variable type.
To do so, just assign a new value to it.
Let's do this by assigning a string value to variable var1.
Type: var1 equal to within double quotes hello and press Enter.
Let's verify the variable type assigned.
Type:  var1 dot class .
Class method tells us what class of variable it is. Now press  Enter.
We get the output as "String".
Ruby has automatically changed the variable type from integer to string.
We will now learn how to convert a variable value to different type.
Let's switch back to slide.
Ruby variable classes have methods to convert their value to a different type.
'to_i' method is used to convert a variable to integer.
'to_f' method is used to convert a variable to floating point value.
'to_s' method is used to convert a variable to string.
'to _s' method takes number base as an argument.
The conversion depends on this number base.
Now, let us try out these methods.
Go to the terminal.  Let's clear the terminal first.
Press Ctrl, L to clear the irb console.
Now,  type: y equal to 20  and press Enter.
Here, we have declared a variable called 'y' and assigned a value 20 to it.
We will now convert 'y' to a floating point value using to underscore f method.
Type: y dot to underscore f and  press Enter.
We get the value as float.
Now, type:  y dot to underscore s and press Enter.
We get the output as 20, within double quotes.
To convert variable 'y' in binary form, give number base as 2 in the to_s method.
Press the up-arrow key to get the previous command.
Type: opening bracket 2 closing bracket and  press Enter.
We get the output in the binary form.
Similarly, you can convert variable 'y' to octal or hexadecimal form
by changing the number base to 8 or 16.
Let us switch back to our slide.
We will now learn what is a variable scope.
Scope defines- where in a program, a variable is accessible.
Ruby has four types of variable scopes:
Local,  Global
Instance and
Class.
Each variable type is declared by using a special character at the beginning of the variable name.
'$' represents global variable.
Lower case letters and underscore represent a local variable.
'@' represents an instance variable.
Two '@@' symbols represent a class variable.
Upper case letters represent a constant.
We will learn in detail, about this, in another tutorial.
This brings us to the end of this Spoken Tutorial. Let us summarize.
To declare a variable, e.g. var1=10
Changing a variable type using 'to_f' and 'to_s' methods
Different variable scopes.
declare a variable and convert it to octal and hexadecimal form.

Welcome to this tutorial on BLAST using Biopython tools.
In this tutorial, we will learn: To run "BLAST" for the query sequence using Biopython tools
And, parse the BLAST output for further analysis.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu Operating System version 14.10
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64 and * a working Internet connection.
BLAST is the acronym for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.
It is an algorithm for comparing sequence information.
The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequences in databases  and calculates the statistical significance of matches.
There are two different ways to run BLAST:
Local BLAST on your machine or run BLAST over Internet through NCBI servers.
Running BLAST in Biopython has two steps.
First, run BLAST for your query sequence and get some output.
Second, parse the BLAST output for further analysis.
We will open the terminal and run BLAST for a nucleotide sequence.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously.
At the prompt, type: ipython and press Enter.
In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to run BLAST over internet using NCBI BLAST service.
Type the following at the prompt: from Bio.Blast Import NCBIWWW Press Enter.
Next, to run the BLAST over internet, type the following at the prompt.result= NCBIWWW.qblast("blastn","nt","186429").
We will use qblast function in the NCBIWWW module.
qblast function takes three arguments:
The first argument is the blast program to use for the search.
Second, specifies the databases to search against.
The third argument is  your query sequence.
The input for the query sequence can be in the form of GI number or a FASTA file. Or, it can also be a sequence record object.
For this demonstration, I am using the GI number for a nucleotide sequence.
The GI number is for a nucleotide sequence of insulin.
The qblast function also takes a number of other option arguments.
These arguments are analogous to the different parameters you can set on the BLAST web page.
The qblast function will return the BLAST results in xml format.
Back to the terminal.
We have to use the appropriate Blast program,
depending on whether our query sequence is a nucleotide or protein sequence.
Since our query is a nucleotide, we will use blastn program and "nt" refers to the nucleotide database.
Details about this are available at the NCBI BLAST webpage.
The blast output is stored in the variable result, in the form of an xml file.
Depending upon the speed of your Internet, it may take a few minutes to complete the BLAST search.
It is important to save the xml file on the disk before processing further.
Type the following lines to save the xml file.
These lines of code will save the search result as blast.xml in the home folder.
Navigate to your home folder and locate the file.
Click on the file and check the contents of the file.
Use the code shown in this text file, if you want to use a FASTA file as a query.
Here is the code, if you want to use sequence record object from a FASTA file as a query.
Back to the terminal.
The next step is to parse the file to extract data.
The first step in parsing is to open the xml file for input.
Type the following at the prompt. Press Enter.
Next, import the module NCBIXML from "Bio.Blast" package.
Type the following lines to parse the Blast output.
A BLAST record contains all the information you want to extract from the BLAST output.
Let us print out some information about all the hits in our blast report greater than a particular threshold.
For a match to be significant, expect score should be less than 0.01.
For each hsp, that is, high scoring pair, we get the title, length, hsp score, gaps and expect value.
We will also print strings containing the query, the aligned database sequence and string specifying the match and mismatch positions.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
For each alignment, we have length, score, gaps, evalue and strings.
You can extract the required information using other functions, available in Bio.Blast package.
Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt to run BLAST for the query nucleotide sequence using GI number.
And, parse the BLAST output using Bio.Blast.Record module.
For the assignment, run BLAST Search for a protein sequence of your choice.
Save the output file and parse the data contained in the file.
Your completed assignment should have the following lines of code, as shown in this  file.
Observe the code. Since our query is protein sequence, we have used blastp program and "nr", that is, non-redundant protein database for the BLAST search.

So, I choose here the Multiply mode.
This is not blue, this is yellow but when I slide this down to a certain point, you see that colours in all the sliders change automatically.
By using the Layers tool, I can do changes anytime I want to and also I can do fine adjustments when more layers are stacked onto it and the change will stay even if I change something in underlying picture.

Welcome back.  Just to summarize - in the first part of the cookie tutorial, we learnt how to create cookies, how to  give an expiry date to the cookie and how to print out specific cookies.
Using this command here, we also learnt how to print out  every cookie that we had stored.
So, assuming that we have created these cookies, the next thing I'll do is - use this specific cookie here that I have created, to check whether it does exist or not.
To do so, we will use a function called isset().
This basically returns a true or false value depending on whether something is set or not.
For example, a cookie. I'll put a dollar sign then underscore cookie.
And I'll put 'name' in here.
So, if I read this out in English language then I'll say -
If the cookie name is set then we say echo “Cookie is set”.
Otherwise we will echo out to the user that "Cookie is not set".
Assuming that I have set my cookie and everything is working, when I refresh this I'll get the message that the "Cookie is set".
Now I'll teach you how to 'unset' a cookie.
So, let's say over here - just before our if statement, I wish to unset my cookie.
So, unset a cookie. So, just to name one, I'll unset this cookie,
presuming that if you learn to unset this one, you can unset this one too.
So, I'll unset this "name" cookie.
So, to unset, we use the same command and that’s  'setcookie()'.
So we are resetting a cookie.
This doesn’t seem to make any sense but it will soon.
Now we will set the cookie name to nothing.
And our expiry date here...
I'll create a new one with "$exp_unset"
and that is gonna equal to the time minus 86400.
Here, we said plus which meant that the time is in the future.
Now by setting the cookie to this variable which represents a time in the future, we are actually unsetting the cookie.
So. if I were to say - set a cookie that already exists called name, to 'no value' at all.
And use “$exp_unset” variable to set it to a time in the future, thereby 'unsetting' our cookie.
So, I'll get rid of this code for now and run this page, okay?
Nothing has happened presuming my cookie is unset.
Now I want to get rid of this code - so I'll comment this out.
And I'll put my if statement back into the page.
Now presuming this says - is the cookie set name? I'm going to unset the cookie which should get the result "Cookie is not set".
Let's refresh and we got "Cookie is not set".
And then from here you can set it again if you like and you can change the values of the cookie.
To change the value of a cookie, you'll have to use 'setcookie()' command again.
You’ll say -  set cookie "name" and here just type a new value.
So, it's not hard to work with cookies.
It's quite an easy process.
And it’s a very very useful thing in php.
So, use it to your heart’s content.  Okay. Thanks for watching.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
This is Evan Varkey, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.  Bye.
Hello friends! Welcome to the tutorial on "Saving Plots".
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to -
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to use Plot command interactively.
Let us initialise the 'pylab' package.
Let us plot a sine curve from minus 3 pi to 3 pi.
First, we will calculate the required points for the plot.
To do this, type:
Let us plot a sine curve for the points stored in variable x.
Type: plot(x comma sin(x)) in the console and press Enter.
Here you can see we have made a very basic sine plot. Now let us see how to save the plot.
For saving the plot, we will use the 'savefig()' function.
Type: savefig('sine.png') and press Enter.
This saves the file in present working directory.
The characters after the dot in the filename is the extension. It determines the format in which you want to save the file.
To check the current working directory, type pwd in the console and press Enter.
To save the file in a different directory, type full path of the directory before the filename.
Note that the above file path is for Linux based file systems.
For Windows, give the entire file path as shown here. Here fossee is the username in Windows and sine.png file is to be saved on Desktop.
Here we have used an extension dot png. This will ensure that the image is saved as a PNG file.
Now let us locate the file sine.png which we had saved earlier.
We have saved the file to
Let us navigate to (slash)home(slash)fossee using the file browser.
Open the sine.png file to see the plotted sine curve.
savefig can save the plot in many formats such as-
eps - encapsulated post script, to be used with LaTeX documents,
Save the sine plot in the eps format.  Let us see the output for this exercise.
Type: savefig('slash home slash fossee slash sine.eps') and press Enter.
Now let us go to slash home slash fossee and see the new file created. We see the file sine.eps here.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:

Hello and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on User-defined functions in awk.
You should have some knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
Now, let us learn about user defined functions.
And, the syntax is self-explanatory.
Here, the keyword function is mandatory.
To call a function, write the name of the function followed by the arguments in parentheses.
Note: space is not allowed between the function name and the open parentheses of the argument.
We will see one example now.
In our awkdemo.txt file, the sixth field represents stipend.
Assume that stipend is either zero or consists of four digits.
Suppose, stipend is 8900.
If stipend is 0, print as zero in words.
I have already written the code in a file named user_function.awk
Here, I have written a function named changeit with a single argument 'argval'.
Here, argval is basically our sixth field which is stipend.
Inside the function, the first code will check if argval is zero or not.
If yes, it will print “Zero” in words.
If not, then  else part of the code will be executed.
In the else part, first we will extract each digit one by one using the substring function.
And, we'll store the values in an array a at different indices.
For example- a[1]  will give the first digit from left hand side or the thousand’s place digit.
Since we have only four digits, I have used four indices.
Next, we will check whether the elements are not equal to zero.
At the end, we print a backslash n character to provide a new line break in the output.
Then, inside the awk script, we have printed dollar 2 which is the second field that is name.
Then we call the function changeit with the parameter dollar 6 which is stipend.
Now, type the following command and press Enter.
An user-defined function can also include a return statement.
This statement returns control to the calling part of the awk program.
It can also be used to return a value for use in the rest of the awk program.
It looks like this: return space expression.
Let’s write a function to return average of an array.
I have written the code in the file average.awk
We have defined a function named avg for this purpose.
It has five parameters.
i is array loop variable.
sum is the summation of all array elements.
n indicates the number of elements in array.
ret represents the variable to be returned from the function avg.
The extra space before i indicates that the variables i, sum, n  and ret are local variables.
Actually, the local variables are not intended to be arguments.
You should follow this convention when defining functions.
Inside the for loop, we have calculated the total number and summation of array elements.
We have calculated the average by dividing summation with the total number of elements
This function avg() returns the value of the variable ret.
Inside the BEGIN section, we have defined array nums with 5 different numbers.
In the print statement, we call the function avg() with one argument which is the array name.
So, you do not have to pass local variables as arguments.
Switch back to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal.
Type the following command- awk space hyphen f space average dot awk.
We get the output as 3.6.
Let us look at one more example.
I have written a code to reverse a string and named it as reverse.awk.
Pause the video here and look at the code to understand how the control flows.
As an assignment, use the function rev to reverse the Roll number field in awkdemo.txt file.
For example, if the roll number is A001, output should be 100A.
The code for the same is provided as reverse_roll.awk in the Code Files link.
In this tutorial we learnt about-
function call and
Write a function to return the minimum value element from an array.

Hello everyone. Welcome to the tutorial on Building GUIs using Netbeans.
In this tutorial, we will see one of the most attractive features of Netbeans which is its GUI Builder.
What does Netbeans provide for building GUI?
It gives you a What You See Is What You Get designer to create your GUI.
Also, it gives you an easy interface to drag-and-drop components to create your layout.
It comes with a component Palette with  pre installed AWT and Swing components.
We will be making use of this powerful visual editor to build a complete GUI application in just a few minutes.
For this demonstration, I'm using a system that has
the Linux Operating system Ubuntu version 11.04
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
For more details on the installation and requirements, please refer to the previous tutorial.
Use the Form Editor
The Source Editor The Palette, Inspector and Properties features
Add event handlers and also
Compile and run our application.
Let's get started and build a simple Account balance application in this tutorial.
For this application, we want to be able to-
Input the amount credited to the account.
The amount debited from the account.
And compute the final balance.
We will also add a picture to make our application look more attractive.
Let's also have a menu bar on top for easy and quick navigation.
Let's now move to netbeans and start by creating a new project.
From the File menu, choose New Project > and choose a Java Application. Say Next
and give your project a name.
I will name my project as "Account balance".
Don't create a Main Class but set it as the Main Project.
Say Finish.  That should create a new project in your IDE.
Now, go back to File in the File menu and select  New File .
Choose Swing GUI Forms, under Categories
and  Jframe Form, under File Type.
Say Next.
I'm going to call this "AccountBalance" as well.
But you can give it any other name you wish to.
Once you say Finish, it takes you to the main Design area.
Let's get familiar with the GUI builder.
On the right, here is the Palette.
This contains the pre-installed Swing and AWT components.
Down here, below the palette,  is the Properties window.
This shows you the properties of the components as you choose them.
On the left,  here is the Navigator or the inspector
which  shows you the components that have been added to the frame
here, on the workspace, in the Design mode.
On the top, here is the Source button.
When you click on it, it takes you to the source code.
As you add components to the design,
it takes the corresponding source code and adds it to the source here.
Let's go back to Design mode and see what components we'll use today.
We will be using some of the components from  the palette
such as Buttons, Labels, Panels,  Tabbed pane etc. to create our applications.
Now, from  the  Palette, let us choose a Tabbed Pane under swing Containers.
Select Tabbed Pane and click on the form.
This should give you a Tabbed frame. You can re-size it using your mouse.
Now, go back to the Palette and choose a Panel.
And click again on your frame.
That should give you a tab.
Go back and choose another Panel. And click on the form again.
That gives you 2 tabs totally.
Now, you can rename the tab by either double-clicking on the tab or right-clicking on the tab and selecting the Edit Text option.
I will call the first tab as "Image" and rename the second tab to "Balance".
Now, let's go back to the Palette and add labels from  Swing Controls menu.
Choose Label from the Swing Controls and add it to your form here.
We are going to need 6 labels for our application.
I have now added  six labels to my form.
You can position and align them as you click them.
And, also use the mouse to re-position or re-align them.
Now, to change the text on a label-
You can either double-click on it or right-click on it
and  choose the option Edit Text.
Let us rename the labels now.
I'm going to call the first one as "Initial Amount",
the second label as "Credit Amount",
the third one as "Debit Amount"
and the fourth one as "Balance".
Initially, we'll set the Initial Amount to be Rs 5000.
Once we compute the balance, we can put it into this label.
But for now, we will just make it as stars.
Now, go back to the Palette and choose a Text Field  and we will add two text fields, one each next to the Credit Amount and to the Debit Amount.
We should also leave the Text field places blank.
Let me edit the text and remove the existing text here.
Let us resize it using the mouse.
Once you have done that, you can now go back to palette and choose a Button.
Add the button below your frame and
you can change the label by right-clicking on it.
Choose the Edit Text option and name it as "Get Balance".
Now, this is our GUI!
Let's now go to the Image tab (tab1) and add an image.
To do that, let's go back to the Palette
and choose another Label and drop it on the panel.
Now, from the Properties  window below the palette, search for the icon property and click on the 3 dots here, on the right.
The icon properties window opens.
Here, choose the option External Image, click on the (...) 3 dots again here, on the right.
And, look for the image you want to include in your application.
I have selected the image here. Click on OK.
Let us re-position it using the mouse.
You can remove the text here on the label by double-clicking on it and removing the text.
Now we have added in image.
Let us next add a menu to our GUI.
Go to the palette and select the Menu bar option, under swing menus.
Choose Menu Bar and click here on top of the panel.
By default, it already has 2 menu labels: File and Edit.
Double-click on the Edit Text and  rename it to Help.
You can also add a sub-menu  under File.
Now, in the Inspector or the Navigator on the left side, right-click on  JMenu1.
Choose Add From Palette  option  and select Menu Item.
That should add a Menu Item.
You can also rename that to say Exit.
Now, we have added a sub-menu under the File menu and renamed that menu item as well.
Now, our GUI is more or less complete.
Let's now look at a preview.
Click on the 'Preview Design' button on the top.
That shows a preview of what you have done so far.
Here, the buttons don't work yet.
But once you add in the code, you can have everything working.
Let us close the preview.
Now, before adding the code, let's give proper variable names to the input text fields.
Go to the Balance tab, let us give proper variable names to these text fields here.
Right-click on JTextfield1 in the inspector.
Select Change Variable Name.
Let us change the variable name to  "creditAmount".
Click on OK.
You can also right-click on the text field here, in the Design mode.
Select Change Variable Name
and change variable name into  "debitAmount".
Click on OK.
I'm also going to call this final label i.e. the stars text field's label as "resultBalance".
Select the Change Variable Name  option again and change the variable to "resultBalance".
Click on OK.
Let's now see the code, to get the application working.
Now, this is my sample code.
What I want here is, to getText() from the "creditAmount";
getText() from the "debitAmount",
compute the balance and place the amount in the final "resultBalance".
Let us  copy the code here and let us go back to the IDE.
Now, right-click on the Get Balance button.
Choose the option Events >>  Action and Action Performed.
This will take you to the section of the code
where you will have to write or paste the code for the action to be performed on the button press.
Let me paste the copied code here.
Let's save this code and go back to the Design mode.
Now, let's add in the code to exit the application.
Right-click on the Menu Item >> Exit and choose  Events >> Action and Action Performed.
It switches to the Source mode and now we have to write the code to exit successfully from the application.
That is going to be System.exit(1).
Now save the code and go back to Design mode.
Let us also add a shortcut to the Exit menu item.
Double-click on the shortcut option here, in the window that opens.
Give the key stroke as Q and Ctrl and click on OK.
So, now we have set Ctrl Q as the keyboard shortcut to quit from the application.
That's it. Our application is now complete..
Let's now run the application by pressing F6 on your keyboard.
It has already selected the main class that has to run.
Click on OK.
And, here it is! This is our GUI.
Now, let's run a check.
Go to the Balance tab, enter the Credit Amount with Rs. 300/-
and  the Debit Amount as Rs. 200. And, say 'Get Balance'.
That gives us the correct amount in the Balance.
Let us now exit from the application.
I'll go to File menu and I'll click on Exit.
We could have also quit the application by pressing Ctrl Q on the keyboard.
Now, with the application complete, it's time for the assignment.
The task is to create a Temperature convertor application.
It should have two tabs like the previous one,
1 to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and another for Fahrenheit to Celsius.
It should also take an input  temperature
and display the converted temperature.
It should also have a menu bar on top that shows File and Help options.
And, under the File menu, have an Exit item with a keyboard shortcut to exit from the application.
I have already solved the assignment.
Let us see how it should look.
I'm going to run my assignment and this is my GUI.
Now, let us enter the input temperature as -40 Celcius and let me click on Get Fahrenheit.
The application should give the correct converted output temperature.
Now, let us  try the short-cut key to Exit i.e.  Ctrl X  to exit from  the application.
So, we have successfully exited from the application upon the keyboard shortcut.
If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos.

Welcome to the  Spoken Tutorial  on  Arduino components and IDE.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: how to set up a physical connection between  Arduino  and a computer,
Arduino  hardware and  Arduino  programming language.
To follow this tutorial, you should have: basic knowledge of Electronics,
First, we have to connect the  Arduino board  to the computer using the  USB  cable as shown here.
The green  power LED  turns  ON . This indicates that the  connection is working.
Now, let us see the various components that are available in the  Arduino  hardware.
The most important component is  ATMEGA 328 microcontroller chip.
This is the heart of  Arduino  where you can program it to do different things.
This  microcontroller  contains internal  ROM, RAM  and also an  Arduino BootLoader.
What is an  Arduino BootLoader ?
These are  digital pins . Each of these can be programmed as either an  input  or  output .
Digital  means they can be  ON  or  OFF , high or low.
For example, to dim an  LED , to generate  audio signals  etc.
The  pin  number 0 and 1 can be used for  serial communication  with other devices.
Here, 0-RX  stands for receiving,
These are  Analog pins  which are marked from  A0  to  A5 . These are only used for inputs.
They take  analog signals  and convert them into  digital signals  that the computer can understand .
These are transmit and receive  LED s that are embedded on the board.
This is very helpful for  troubleshooting .
When you press this  reset  button, the program stops and restarts.
It will not erase anything off the  board .
This is input voltage to the  Arduino board  when it is using an external power source.
These are  Ground pins  which give access to the lowest voltage on the  board.
USB interface  can be used for programming the  board.
We have this external  power adapter  to power up the  board.
Next, we will see about  Arduino  programming language.
Arduino  programs can be divided into three main parts.
and,  Functions.
The control statements are:  if, if..else, for, while, do..while, switch case  etc .
These are the same as in any programming language.
Then, we have  arithmetic operators, comparison operators  and  boolean operators.
We have  variables  and  constants  as in other programming languages.
These are  built-in functions  such as  pinMode(), digitalWrite(), digitalRead(), delay(), analogRead(), analogWrite()  etc.
These are the important functions which are mostly used in the  Arduino  projects.
I'll show you how to refer this programming language of  Arduino IDE .
Let us open the  Arduino IDE .
Click on the  Help  menu in the  Arduino IDE . Then click on  Reference.
For example, if you want to refer the  'digitalWrite()' built-in function, just click  on the function name.
Here you can see the description, syntax and a sample program of  digitalWrite()  function.
There are many  built-in functions  and we can refer to this manual depending upon our requirement.
We will be learning about some of the important built-in functions in the subsequent tutorials.
This brings us  to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial, we learnt about:  how to set up a physical connection between the  Arduino  and computer,
' Arduino'  hardware,  Arduino  programming language.
As an assignment- open the  Arduino IDE.
Click on the  Help  Menu and select  Reference.
Go through the  built-in functions  such as  delay(), pinMode() and digitalRead() etc.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on RESTful API Implementation.
In this tutorial, we will  Understand what is RESTful API
Learn to implement RESTful API using Views
To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 16.04
Drupal 8 and  Firefox web browser
To practise this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Drupal.
What is RESTful API?
RESTful API is based on REpresentational State Transfer (i.e REST) technology.
It is also referred to as a RESTful web service.
RESTful API provides methods to external clients to fetch, add or modify data on the server.
For example:  Using the same server, we can do a bank transaction either using a mobile app or desktop website.
RESTful API is a general purpose API.
So any application, such as  another website,  native mobile apps and  IoT devices  can exchange data with your server.
Let us learn the RESTful API implementation process step by step.
The following steps are applicable to Bitnami Drupal Stack.
But most of the steps are applicable to any other Drupal installation, as well.
Step No. 1
To do so, go to the Extend tab.
Scroll down and go to the WEB SERVICES section.
Put a check mark on the following modules: HAL, HTTP Basic Authentication, RESTful Web Services and Serialization.
Then click on the Install button at the bottom, to enable them.
We will also need to install the REST UI module manually.
I have already installed and enabled it in my machine.
To know how to install a module, go through the Creating Dummy Content tutorial in this series.
Step No. 2
To do so, go to the Configuration tab. Click on REST under WEB SERVICES.
The REST resources page appears now.
We will restrict the formats by clicking on the Edit button of Content.
Scroll down. Under Accepted request formats, put a check mark on the json.
Click on the Save configuration button at the bottom to save it.
Now our Drupal site will accept the json format requests from a REST client.
Step No. 3
In general, there are three kind of users that can use RESTful API.
anonymous user
authenticated user and
authenticated users with permission to modify content
Now, we will setup our Drupal for an authenticated user who can create, edit, and delete their own contents.
To do so, go to People tab.
Click on the Permissions tab.
Scroll down and for AUTHENTICATED USER, put a checkmark on   Basic Page: Create new content
Basic Page: Delete own content
Basic Page: Edit own content
Click on the Save permissions button at the bottom.
I have enabled the authenticated users to create, edit and delete their own content.
You can give permissions based on your requirements.
Step No. 4
Go to Structure tab and click on the Content types.
I will use the Events content type to implement the RESTful API.
You can use any content type as per your requirement.
Step No. 5
To know about Views, go through the tutorial Displaying Contents using Views of this series.
To create a new view, go to Structure and Views.
Click Add view and let’s name it as Events underscore view.
Change the content of type from All to Events.
Under REST EXPORT SETTINGS, check Provide a REST export.
We will type the REST export path as events.
Click Save and edit button at the bottom.
Now we will set up the display of our events.
Under FORMAT section, in the Show option, click on the Entity.
In the REST export dialog box that appears, choose Fields option.
Click on the Apply button.
In the Row style options dialog box, keep the settings as it is.
Then click on the Apply button.
This will enable us to add fields to our view.
Now we can add all the fields of our Events content type.
This brings up the list of available fields.
In the Search box, type body.
Choose Body from the list, then click on the Add and configure fields button.
Click on the Apply button.
Again click on the Add button to add another field.
Search for id and choose ID from the list.
Click on the Add and configure fields button.
Then click on the Apply button.
Under PATH SETTINGS, we can see the path of our events view.
We will click on the Save button to save this view.
Step No. 6
Click on the Add button in the Displays panel.
Select REST export option.
Now let us configure this new view.
Under FORMAT section, click on the Entity.
Choose Fields option and click on the Apply button.
Check all the fields that we want in our content type.
Here you can see that our required fields are added now.
Under PATH SETTINGS, we will set the path by clicking on the No path is set link.
In the Path field, type events slash percentage sign.
Percentage sign is used to represent values that will be used for the contextual filter.
Click on the Apply button at the bottom.
Now, in the right hand side, click on the ADVANCED option.
Under CONTEXTUAL FILTERS, click on the Add button.
We will add an ID for the contextual filter to refer our node.
Search for id and choose the ID from the list.
Click on the Apply button.
Keep the other settings as it is.
Then click on the Apply button.
Click on the Save button to save this configuration.
With this, we have successfully implemented the RESTful API in our Drupal site using Views.
Later in the series, we will learn how to check our RESTful API using a REST Client.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about-  RESTful API and  Implementation of RESTful API using Views

Hello friends. Welcome to the tutorial on Editing using Audacity.
This tutorial will explain how to edit an audio file. We will learn how to:
open an audio file in audacity
convert a stereo file to mono,  Attach labels , Cut, delete, move and amplify the audio
For this tutorial, I am using the Ubuntu Linux 10.04 version operating system and Audacity version 1.3.
Audacity supports many audio formats including:
WAV (Windows Wave format)
AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)
Sun Au / NeXT
RCAM (Institut de Recherce et Coordination Acoustique / Musique)
MP3 (MPEG I, layer 3) (export requires separate encoder. see Lame Installation),  Ogg Vorbis.
Let's access Audacity through the Main menu item Applications >> Sound & Video >> Audacity.
An Audacity Help box opens. Let’s click OK.
To edit an audio file, we need to first import it into Audacity. To do this, go to File >> Import >> Audio.
When the browser window opens, browse for the audio file to be edited and click on Open.
The file opens in the Audacity window.
Save this file as an 'a u p' file (i.e. Audacity project file) by clicking on File >> Save Project As.
Click OK in the box that opens.
Give your file a name. Here we will type 'Editing in Audacity'.
Check the folder and click on Save.
Select Copy All Audio into Project (safer) option.
This creates a folder that will contain all the audacity project data files.
Look at the tracks. If there is only one track then the audio is in MONO.
This will also be mentioned in the Label on the left panel.
Now, let's open another audio file.
If there are 2 tracks then the audio is in STEREO. Again, this will be mentioned in the Label on the left panel.
To remove a track completely- select the track, click on Tracks tab and select Remove Tracks.
Alternately, delete tracks by clicking on the 'X' at the extreme left.
If the audio file is in 'stereo' mode and stereo output is not required then one can convert the mode to 'mono'.
To do so, go to the Tracks tab and select Mix and Render.
Now, click on the drop-down arrow on the panel to the left of the audio file and select Split stereo to Mono.
Delete one track.
To zoom into or out of a file, click the cursor where you need to zoom on the file and click the zoom-in or zoom-out button on the Edit panel.
Alternately, place the cursor over the part of the file that you need to zoom into or out of.
Now, press the Ctrl key down and use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out.
An audio file can be cut to remove unwanted parts, copied, pasted, deleted and treated with some special effects.
The volume of the file can also be increased or decreased.
Before editing, always listen to the whole audio file. You may want to label parts as you listen for easy reference.
To do so, add a label track by clicking on Tracks >> Add New and Label Track.
To add a label at a point, select the point with the cursor, go to the Tracks tab
and select Add Label At Selection.
You can type into the label.
Alternately- click at the point,
press Ctrl +B.
This opens a new Label track, the first time.
Consecutive Ctrl+B will open new labels on the same track.
A label will open with the cursor at the point on the time line where the cursor is placed.
Place the cursor wherever required and press Ctrl+B for each new label.
Labels can also be moved.
To delete the labels, click inside the text box and press backspace till the label is deleted.
Another way to do this is to go to Tracks >> Edit Labels.
A window with all the labels listed will appear and the labels that need to be deleted can be selected and deleted by clicking on Remove button.
After listening to the entire audio file once or more than once, the structure of the edit can be decided; parts of the file can be deleted or moved, as required.
Structure the edit based on what is appropriate for introduction, body and conclusion.
Remove repeats and bad sound. Effects can be used to enhance the impact of a message.
Unwanted sounds such as stammering and coughs that don't overlap the speech, repeats and long silences can be removed.
To delete:
To move one segment of audio to another part:
We can also click on the Cut button in the Edit tools panel OR click on Edit >> Cut option.
Move the cursor to the place where the audio segment needs to be moved,
click there and paste the audio segment.
This can be done with either the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V or the Paste button
in the Edit tools panel or Edit >>
Paste option.
To reduce loud breaths: select the breath portion in the audio stream by
left-clicking, dragging and releasing.
Go to Effect >> Amplify. Enter -5 or -7
or more in the Amplification box, depending on how much you want to reduce the sound and click OK.
To increase the volume of the parts that have recorded softly, select the audio >> go to Effect >> Amplify.
You will see a value already there. This value is optimal amplification for this file. You can also enter the amount you want.
If the OK button is not active, check the Allow Clipping option.
To filter out disturbing background noises, select a portion on the track with the sample noise.
Remember to select a portion without voice.
Now click on Effect >> Noise Removal.
Click on Get Noise Profile.
This will identify the noise sample to be filtered.
Now, select the whole audio track by clicking anywhere on it.
Again, click on Effect >> Noise Removal.
Choose the Noise Reduction Level.
Use the lowest value that reduces the noise to an acceptable level.
Higher values will remove the noise completely but will result in distortion of the audio that remains.
Let's click OK.
It is advisable not to amplify the audio too much above the recommended value in the box because amplification also enhances background sounds.
Hisses and hums will become more prominent as well.
Save the project file regularly.
Finally, export the final project to the required audio format i.e. wav, mp3 and others.
We have already covered this part in the earlier tutorial. Kindly refer to it for details.
That's all we have in this tutorial. Let's just summarize. In this, we learned  the basics of editing using audacity -
How to open an audio file,  Convert stereo to mono
Structure and edit ,  Cut, delete, move audio
Edit the audio that you have recorded in the first tutorial, using the tips given above.
Use fade-out and fade-in where necessary.

Hello and welcome back to another QCAD tutorial
Drawing methods in QCAD and knowing coordinate system.
QCAD uses Cartesian co-ordinate system which consists of two numbered scales, called as x-axis, y-axis.
These are perpendicular to each other. These axes divide coordinate system into 4 quadrants.
Your work in QCAD will mostly be in quadrant I.
The point where these axes meet is called as absolute origin or the origin point.
For this tutorial, I am using the GNU Linux operating system Ubuntu Version 10.04 LTS
and QCAD Community Edition Version 2.0.5.0
Cartesian coordinate system
How to use command line to draw objects and
different drawing methods available in QCAD.
Let's first see how to use command line to put in co-ordinates, to draw points and draw objects of required measurements
using the Cartesian coordinate system.
Please have the QCAD application open in your system.
If you want to know how to install QCAD, please refer to the earlier tutorial called 'Introduction to QCAD'
which is available on spoken-tutorial website.
Once the application is open, from the tool bar on left, choose Line tool- Line with two points.
Now focus on the command prompt because we are going to use command line to put in exact coordinates.
It is asking to 'specify first point'. Let's put 10 comma 10.
We always put X-axis value first and then the Y-axis value.
What it is going to do is, it will add a point, 10 units away from X and from Y-axis.
Hit Enter. See the point is entered in relation to this origin or absolute 0, 0
which is 10 units away from X and 10 units away from Y-axis.
Now, suppose I want to draw a horizontal line in this direction, going away from this point, say 10 units.
For the next point, I will add 20, 10.
X-axis value is 20 because this point, the new point, will always be in relation to this absolute zero.
So, to meet the distance of 10, I will have to add 10 units to the earlier point's X-value.
And Y-value will not change; so, it will be 10 here.
Now, if I want to go vertical line downwards again of 10 units,
for the next point at the command prompt, I will put 20, 0.
X-axis value won't change, Y-axis will be 20 units -ve from the earlier value. So, it will be 0.
Now, again to go horizontal in 9 (nine) O'clock direction, for the next point, I will put (showing on application so pause for 4 sec. 3:11-3:15) 10, 0.
Here, Y-axis won't change and X-axis will be -10
in relation to the previously drawn point.
Now, to close my drawing I can always put 'c' and hit Enter or
I can go back to my original point which was 10, 10
and it will close the drawing. This is how you draw using the command line input.
You can draw any drawing by using this coordinate system by adding, subtracting absolute co-ordinates for any point or vertex between two segments
like I did to draw this 10 units.
But this is going to be little complicated.
Rather QCAD offers three easy methods to draw objects with.
First is Relative co-ordinates System.
It uses coordinates that are relative to the last point designated, rather than a 0,0 point of the drawing area.
"@" symbol is used to enter data, using this system.
Let's try drawing this previously drawn square, using relative coordinate system.
Let me clear my drawing.
Go back to line tool- Line with two points.
To specify first point, at the command prompt, enter 10,10- again X and Y-axis.
It is going to put point at 10,10 distance. For the next point, now that we are using relative system, we have to put '@' symbol.
Whenever we want to use relative system '@' symbol is a must.
After that, I want to draw horizontal line in 3 O'clock direction of 10 units.
So, X value is 10. So, I put @10,0 because Y value is zero here.
Now, for the vertical line going in downward direction, again for relative I use '@'.
Then X value is zero but Y becomes -10 because it is going in opposite direction. That is why value is -ve (negetive) here.
For the next horizontal line in 9 O'clock direction, I say @.
Now X-axis is -ve (negetive), it is going in opposite direction in relation to the previously drawn point -10,0.
And now, to close the drawing, I can put 'C' and Enter.
Or to go back to that original point- This case I say @ 0  X-axis is zero and Y is going vertical in +ve direction, so +10.
This is how you draw using relative coordinate method.
Next is Relative Polar co-ordinate system.
It relies on distance and angle relative to the last specified point.
Always it is positive and represents distance away from the first point.
Let's try and draw the previously drawn square, using this (relative) polar coordinate system.
In polar coordinates, right towards 3 O'clock is always default zero angle.
All other angles are calculated in anti-clockwise direction related to default zero.
So, let's go to Line tool – again Line with two points.
At the command prompt, specify first point as 10,10. Enter. Point is drawn.
Now, to draw horizontal line of 10 units using relative polar coordinates, I first put @ symbol because it is relative method.
Then I say distance, I know which is 10.
I use this symbol (<) less than symbol “<” for angle
I know angle is in 3 O'clock direction, which is zero. (@10<0)
So, my horizontal line of 10 units is drawn.
For the vertical line in downward direction, I again put @10<270
and 270 as angle this time because anti-clockwise downward is 270.
For the next point, horizontal line in 9 O'clock direction,
I say @10<180, angle will be 180 as it is exactly opposite to the default zero position.
Lastly, I can always put 'c' to close or else enter the point as @10<90; because, it is going in upward direction.
This completes our drawing in Polar coordinates method.
Third is the Direct distance method
which can be used to draw lines by specifying first point in relation to already drawn object using snapping tools
by placing a cursor at that point and entering a distance value.
Let's say- in this drawing, if I want to put a horizontal line going in 3 O'clock direction exactly from this point.
I can do so by using this direct method.
I choose Line- Line with two points. Now I know exactly at what point I want line ahead.
So, from Snapping options on the left tool bar, I choose 'snap to endpoint' and then go on that point and left-click to select the first point.
Now, in relation to this I want to draw horizontal line of 20 units.
So, I use command line to specify my next point.
I can use relative polar coordinate system here.
Since it is relative, I say @ now distance is 20 and in 3 O'clock direction which is default zero angle. So, I say @20<0
and Enter. The line is drawn.
Now say, I want vertical line of say 7 units going in 90 degrees direction.
I can use now relative co-ordinate method here.
And, say @ (I know 7 is Y direction and X is zero) so 0,7
and I can use relative coordinate method to draw this vertical line.
Again, if I want horizontal line going in 9 O'clock direction, say 5 units away.
I can again use relative coordinate method. At the command prompt, I say @ -5 now because X value will be negetive comma 0, Y is zero.
Now, I can close down this line because I know the distance is 7.
I can draw vertical line going towards 6 O'clock direction.
Once I know all the different methods I can draw objects with, I can use combination of any to draw objects.
So, now to draw that vertical line, I can use relative polar method.
So, I say @ I know distance is 7, I use '<' (angle) symbol since it is 6 O'clock direction, it is going to be 270.
This completes our drawing.
This is how you use different methods in QCAD.
Now that you are familiar with drawing methods and the coordinates system in QCAD,
Let's come to the assignment.
I would like you to draw diagram as shown in the figure.
You can either use relative coordinate, relative polar, direct method or combination of any method to draw this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Type Conversion in Java.
In this tutorial, we learn:
How to convert data from one data type to another.
The two types of conversion, namely implicit and explicit conversion and
How to convert strings to numbers.
For this tutorial we are using:
To follow this tutorial, you must have  knowledge of data types in Java.
Type conversion means converting data from one data type to another.
Let us see how it it done.
Switch to Eclipse.
I have created a class TypeConversion and added the main method to it.
Now let us create a few variables.
int a  equal to 5;
I have created two variables. a which is an integer and b which is a float.
I’m storing the integer value in a float variable.
Let us see what the float variable now contains.
System dot out dot  println(b);
Save the file and run it.
We can see that the integer 5 has been converted to float 5.0
This type of conversion is called implicit conversion.
As the name goes,  the value is automatically converted to suit the data type.
Now let us convert float to an int, using the same method.
Remove the 5,  float b equal to 2.5f  and let us store 'b' in 'a' and print the value of 'a'.
Save the file.
we see that there is an error.
The error message  reads- Type mismatch: cannot convert from float to int.
It means Implicit conversion is possible only from an int to a float but not the the other way.
To convert a float to an  int we have to use explicit conversion.
We do that by using an int in parentheses, before the variable.
This statement says the data in the variable 'b' has to be converted to int data type and stored in 'a'.
save and run the file.
As we can see, the float value has been converted to int.
But to suit the data type, the data has been changed accordingly.
Explicit conversion can also be used to convert data from int to float.
Let us try the previous example.
int a =5; float b; b = (float) a;
System.out.println(b);
We are using Explicit conversion to convert integer to a  float.
Save  the file and Run it.
we see that the int value has been converted to a float value.
Let us  see what happens when we convert a character to an integer.
int a; char c  equal to in single quotes m;
a equal to  (int) c;
System dot out dot println(a);
We are converting the character 'm' to an integer and printing the value.
Let us save and run it.
As we can see, the output is 109 which is the ascii value of 'm'.
It means when a char is converted to int, its ascii value is stored.
Let us try this with a digit.
char c = digit 5;
Save it and run it.
As we can see, the output is 53 which is the ascii value of the character ‘5’.
It is not the number 5.
To get the number, we have to use a string and convert it to an integer.
Now let us see how to do so.
Clean up the main function.
String sHeight meaning string form of Height equal to in double quotes 6
int h equal to explicit conversion  int of sHeight  and
System dot out dot  println(h) Save the file.
I’ve created a string variable with value 6 and I am trying to convert it to an integer but we see that there is an error
and the error message reads: Cannot cast from String to int.
This means, for converting strings, we cannot use implicit or explicit conversion.
It must be done by other methods. let us use them.
Remove  int sHeight  and type  Integer dot parseInt sHeight;
Save the file and run it.
we see that the value has been successfully converted to an integer.
To do this, we use the parseInt  method of the integer module.
Now let us see what happens if there are more than one digits like "6543"
Save the file and run it.
We see that again the string containing  the number has been successfully converted to an integer.
Now, let us see what happens if the string is a floating point number.
Change "6543" to "65.43". So, we have a floating point number in a string and we are converting it to an integer.
Save the file, run it.
We see that there is an error. This happens because we cannot convert a   string  which contains floating point number into an integer.
We have to convert it to  a float. Let us see how to do so.
First, data type should be float,
second we will use Float. parseFloat.
We are using the parseFloat method of the float class to convert the string containing a floating point number into an actual floating point number.
Save the file, run it. We can  see that the string containing a floating point number  has been successfully converted  to a floating point number.
And this is how we do implicit and explicit conversion and how we convert strings to numbers.
This brings us to  the end of the tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learnt: How to convert data from one type to another.
What is meant by implicit and  explicit conversion.
and How to convert strings to numbers.
As an assignment for this tutorial, read about the Integer.toString and Float.toString methods
and find out what do they do?

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Using Single Board heater System Virtual labs on Windows OS.
In this spoken tutorial, we will learn about: Software installations required on the remote users' computer
Using SBHS website
Performing a Step test experiment remotely.
As a pre-requisite, watch the following tutorials-  Introduction to SBHS and Introduction to Xcos.
These are available on the spoken tutorial website.
I am recording this tutorial on a Windows-7, 32-bit Operating System.
Ensure that Scilab is installed on your computer.
Scilab can be downloaded from sbhs dot os hyphen hardware dot in slash downloads OR www dot scilab dot org.
Please note that you will need internet connectivity to install Scilab.
All SBHS experiment Scilab codes are written using Scilab 5.3.3 and is the recommended version.
A higher version of Scilab will work equally well.
However, code modified in a higher version of Scilab cannot be re-used in the lower version.
I have already installed Scilab 5.3.3.
Now, the next step is to download the experiment Scilab code.
Open a web browser.
In the address bar, type: os hyphen hardware dot in and press the Enter key.
This is the website for Open Source - Hardware.
Click on the project SBHS.
On the left hand side, click on Downloads.
Click on the download link for SBHS Scilab codes for Windows.
It will download the Scilab code.
Save it on the Desktop.
Here it is!
The file downloaded will be in zip format.
Extract the content of this zip file on the Desktop.
To do so, right-click on it and choose Extract Here.
The contents inside this folder will be discussed at a later part of this tutorial.
Now, let us see the SBHS Virtual labs website.
On the left hand side, click on the link Virtual Labs.
This is the interface from where one can gain access to do remote experiments on SBHS.
A first time user needs to register once, by clicking on the Login/Register option.
After this, a form has to be filled and submitted.
An activation link is emailed to the user after the form is submitted successfully.
The link received in the email should be used to complete the registration process.
Note that the activation process may not be immediate. It may take a few minutes.
I will now login with my registered account.
I will enter my username and password.
After a successful login, a user has access to Book Slot, View/Delete Slot etc.
A slot is the time duration in which you can perform an experiment.
In our case, a slot lasts for 55 minutes of every hour.
After clicking on the Book Slot option, the client will have two choices.
One can either book Current Slot or a Future Slot.
Book Now option will appear only if the current slot is vacant.
Book future slot option will always be available.
It will allow two non-consecutive slots to be booked, each day.
I will click on the Book Now option.
You will receive an acknowledgement with your booking details appearing on the top side.
The slot booking part is over. Let us now run a simple Step Test experiment, downloaded from the website.
Open the folder you downloaded and saved on the Desktop.
You can see that there is a StepTest folder and a common files folder.
Do not move any of the folders from their location.
If the directory structure is changed, the experiment will not execute.
If you want one experiment to be copied elsewhere, make sure you copy the common_files folder too.
However, make sure the common files folder is always outside the experiment folder.
Open the common files folder. Open the file config.
This file is used to do the proxy settings.
Do not change the contents of config file if you are inside IIT Bombay OR
you are outside IIT Bombay and using an open network.
For example, at home or using a mobile internet.
Change the contents of the config file if you are outside IIT Bombay and using a proxy network.
For example- at an institute, office etc.
Put the value of use proxy as Yes with Y capital.
Change the other details as per the proxy network which you are on.
Save and close this file.
Open the StepTest folder.
Locate and double-click on the file run.
It will open the python based 'SBHS client' application.
Note that the first time execution of this file will take a minute to open the SBHS client.
It will show various parameters of the experiment like-
SBHS Connection, Client version, User login and Experiment status.
Green dots mean that the SBHS client can connect to the server.
It also shows that the client version I am using is the latest.
User login and Experiment status is red because I have still not logged in and the experiment is not running.
It will also give you an option to login.
Type your username and password.
This username and password is the same as you used to book a slot.
Click on login.
Ensure that you login on the booked date and time, with correct login details.
Expect the message "Ready to execute scilab code".
Switch to the StepTest folder which has the experiment files.
Double-click on the stepc file.
This should open Scilab automatically.
It should also open the file in Scilab editor.
If it doesn't, click on the File menu. Click on Open a file.
Choose the file stepc and click on Open.
Switch to the Scilab console.
Type the command: getd space dot dot slash common files and press Enter.
Switch to the scilab editor.
On the menu bar, click on Execute option and then click on File with echo .
If the network is working properly, it will open an Xcos diagram.
If it doesn't, it will show error on the Scilab console.
Using the step test Xocs diagram, we can set the experiment parameters such as Heat and Fan.
Double-click on each block to change its parameters.
I will set the heat to vary from 30% to 45% after 300 seconds.
I will put the Initial Value as 30, Final Value equal to 45 and Step Time equal to 300.
Similarly, I will set the Fan to be constant at 50% which is the default value.
Now, let us save and execute the xcos diagram.
To execute, click on the Start button on the menu bar.
If there is no error, it will open a plot window.
It will consist of three graphs, Heat, Fan and Temperature from top to bottom.
Switch to the SBHS client.
It shows the values of current iteration, heat, fan, temperature and time left for experimentation.
It shows the Log file name, it has created for this experiment.
Switch to the browser. Click on the Show video option.
It will give a live video feed of the SBHS you are currently accessing.
This is a real experiment and will take some time to complete.
I will pause this recording for some time and then resume again.
After sufficient time of experiment, the graph obtained is as shown.
I will stop the simulation by clicking on  stop button, available on the Xcos window.
Close the SBHS client window after the experiment is over.
Now, switch to the experiment folder and open the logs folder.
It will have a folder named after your username.
Open this folder and locate your log file.
Read the log file name as year month date hours minutes seconds dot txt.
Use this log file for further analysis.
Let us summarise.
In this tutorial, we learnt: what are the software installations required to do a remote experiment on SBHS
How to use the SBHS virtual labs website
How to use the python based SBHS client application
How to execute the Scilab code of an experiment.
It summarises the Spoken Tutorial project.

As we can see the content of test1 is shown. Now if we want to copy it into another file called test2, we would write:
If it already existed then it would be silently overwritten. To see the copied file, type:
We can also copy files from and to different directories. For example-
What this will do is that it will copy the file 'demo1' from source diretory- /home/anirban/arc/ to the destination directory- /home/anirban; it will copy to a file whose name is demo2.
And as you can see, here is demo2.
Type: cp space /home/anirban/arc/demo1 space /home/anirban/ and press Enter.
As before, to see the demo1, type: ls/home/anirban and press Enter.
Again, before moving ahead, let us clear the screen.
Now, we type:  cp space test1 space test2 space test3 space /home/anirban/testdir and press Enter.
Let us see an example.
To see that the file has been actually removed or not, let us again press  ls space testdir and press Enter.
It compares two files byte by byte.
Let us see what they contain?
This brings me to the end of this tutorial at last.
More information on the same is available at the following link-

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Formatting Data in Calc.
Format cell borders and cell background colors.
Format multiple lines of text using Automatic Wrapping.
Merge cells.
Shrink the text to fit inside the cell.
First let us learn about formatting cell borders in Calc.
Open our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
Formatting of borders can be done on a particular cell or a block of cells.
Select the cells, A2 to G2 by holding the left mouse button.
Then go to the Formatting toolbar and select the Borders icon.
In that case, click on the double arrow icon at the end of the toolbars to see the hidden icons.
Click on the Borders icon.
A drop-down box opens up containing several border styles.
Click on any one of the styles you wish to apply on the borders.
Now click anywhere on the spreadsheet to deselect the cells.
Notice that the cell borders are formatted according to the selected border style.
Let us undo this change by pressing Ctrl+Z keys.
We can also do the same thing using the Format cells dialog box.
Right-click on the selected cells and choose Format Cells option.
Or press Ctrl+1 keys on the keyboard.
Either way, the Format Cells dialog box opens up.
We see the options for Line arrangement, Line, Padding and Shadow style.
One can change any of these as per our preference.
In the Line Arrangement section, we can see a small preview window named: User-defined.
Under Presets, I will click on the third option.
You can see that it gets reflected in the preview window.
I will also change the Style, Width and Color from the Line section, as shown.
From the style drop-down, I will select the dotted lines.
I will set the width as 2.00 pt. and select the color as Red.
Observe the changes in the preview window.
Next, go to the Padding section.
Observe that all the values are the same.
If we try to change the padding value of any one of the sides, all of them get changed.
This is because the Synchronize option is checked.
If we wish to set different values for each side.
Then the Synchronize option needs to be unchecked.
Let’s uncheck the Synchronize option.
I will set the padding value for Top and Bottom margins to 1.5 mm.
And the Left and Right margins to 1 mm.
You can explore the various Shadow styles on your own later.
Click on the OK button at the bottom.
Now click anywhere on the spreadsheet to deselect the cells.
Notice that our chosen border style is now applied to all the selected cells.
In our earlier tutorial, we had set one of the default styles to the headings.
Now let us set some other colors to the headings, using the Background Color option.
Now select the cells A1 to G1 by holding the left mouse button.
Then go to the Formatting toolbar and select the drop-down next to the Background Color icon.
The Background Color popup menu opens up.
Select the color you wish to apply as a background to the cells.
Now the background color for the headings is set to Orange.
Calc provides various options for formatting multiple lines of text.
One of them is Automatic Wrapping.
It allows a user to type multiple lines of text into a single cell. Let us try this.
Right-click on cell B9 and select Format Cells option.
Then go to the Alignment tab.
Under the Properties section, check the Wrap text automatically option.
Now type the following text in cell B9.
“This is a personal Finance Tracker. It is very useful”.
We see that the multiple statements get wrapped into the same cell.
Undo these changes by pressing Ctrl+Z keys.
Next we will learn how to merge cells in Calc.
First click on the cell with value 1 under the heading SN.
Now hold down the Shift key on the keyboard and click on the cell which has the word Salary.
The selected cells get highlighted.
Click on the Merge and centre cells icon in the Formatting bar.
Merge Cells dialog box opens up.
Here three options for merging the cells are displayed along with a preview.
I want to move the contents of both the cells into a single cell.
So, I will select the Move the content of hidden cells into the first cell radio button.
Then click on the OK button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Observe that the selected cells and their values are merged together.
Alternatively, we can merge cells by clicking on the Format menu in the menu bar.
From the sub-menu, go to Merge Cells and select any one preferred option.
Undo these changes by pressing Ctrl+Z keys.
Next we will learn how to shrink text to fit into a cell.
The font size of the data in a cell can be automatically adjusted to fit the data into the cell.
First type the following text in cell B10 - “This is for the month of June”. Then press Enter.
In order to shrink the text so that it fits, right-click on cell B10.
Then select the option Format Cells.
Format cells dialog box opens up.
Go to the Alignment tab.
Under the Properties section, click on the Shrink to fit cell size check-box.
Then click on the OK button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Observe that, the entire text inside the cell shrinks and fits within the cell.
It adjusts itself by decreasing its font size so that the text fits into the cell.
Undo the changes by pressing Ctrl+Z keys together.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial, let us summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Format cell borders and cell background colors.
Format multiple lines of text using Automatic Wrapping.
Merge cells and
Shrink the text to fit inside the cell.
Select all the headings.
Give Grey background color to the headings.
Using “Automatic Wrapping” type the text in cell A10 - “This is a Department Spreadsheet”.
Shrink this text to fit inside cell A11.

Welcome to the 3rd part of our User login tutorial.
Here, we'll create a session in which the user can enter a page and they're allowed to be inside the page as long as they have successfully logged in.
To start any session, we will need a function which is "start session()".
Is it "start session" or "session start"?  Let's just test it quickly.
Right, an error!  So, it must be session_start().  Sorry, I was a bit confused there.
"Session start", okay? So refresh, resend and "You're in!"
We've started the session and this let's us add a session variable.
So, "You're in!".  After this, I'll say "Click here to enter the secret... no, the member page." okay?
And this is going to be a link to a page called "member dot php".
Let's just recap. As long as we send the right data, we're going to say "Click here to enter the member page" which we haven't created yet.
Let me remind you here that we just created our "session_start()" here which is very important.
We're going to create a session and to do this, let me start and type here the dollar sign underscore SESSION and then in brackets, in square brackets, we will give it a session name.
I'll call it "username" and that will be equal to our username.  I think I will say '$dbusername' because that's a more direct value from the database.
We have our session set.
As long as the user is in their browser, not the browser you evoked them with, then when we echo out our session in any page now, this will be set as a session.
To prove this I'll create a new page.
It'll be the "member dot php" page.
So, I'll save this as "member dot php".
Here I'll say echo and I'll echo the "username" session, okay?
In fact, I'll concatenate at the start "Welcome" and at the end, just to make it more expressive, let me add an exclamation mark.
As long as we are logged in, this should run this command here, setting our session in our browser to our "username" on any other page we create.
If this is any other page over here and you use this code to set, it will work.
You will, of course, need this function inside here, as well.
So you need "session start()" inside every page that you call or declare a session in.
There we restart. Let's go back to the main page.
I'll login with my details as "Alex" and "abc", click on Login.
"You're in! Click here to enter the member page". Now as you can see, there is no error. I've successfully created my session.
If I click here, we get "Welcome!" We have got only that.  Let's see what happened.
Let's go back and see what I've done wrong. This should be "$username".
I'm not using any comparison here but I've put a double equals sign here. That might be wrong.
Now this should work. Let's go back to our "index" page and let's log in again, as we did before.
Login, okay, "You're in! Click here to enter the member page".  Click here and "Welcome, alex!".
Now I'll go back to the login page.
Most people would think all that data has been lost now.
But if I go back to the member page which is "member dot php" and press Enter, it is still saying "alex".
And in some second-starts, if I close my browser and reopen it and I go to "local host php academy" then go back to my page which is the "login session" and back to my member page, I'm still logged in. okay?
So, my user is logged in. If I close the browser, I am  still going to be logged in when I enter back.
This is a very useful function if you're doing this kind of logging in.
A lot of websites do this to keep you logged in.
But now I want to create a log-out page.
To log out, all we need to do is: we need to create a separate page and let's just save it as "logout dot php".
And we need to end our session here.
First of all, before we destroy our session we need to start it.
So I'll type "session_start()" here. Let me confirm it once.
Ok. And then we need to say "session_ destroy()". Sorry, not sestroy, destroy.
If we run this page here, it will destroy our session.
Here, I could type a friendly error message "You've been logged out. Click here to return".
Let me create a link back to our "index dot php" page.
Now I'll test this again. For example, let's say...
Let's put a break there. Here I'll create a link to log-out.
It's important to give the link to the user to our "logout  dot php" page; otherwise they'll not know how to logout.
We refresh this and it will create a Logout link, to log out from the php page.
Click on this and you get "You've been logged out. Click here to return".
I assume that we've been logged out. Trying to go back to our member page dot php.
We have got no variable here.
Now you don't want the users to get access to this page because they are not logged in right now.
So, here I'll say session_start() then I'll say if session and the session name which is 'username'.
Next, I'll echo out my data to say "Welcome" else I'll say die().
No! Not me - I want my page to die! So I'll say "You must be logged in".
We're saying: if this session exists or if it has been created by using a correct username and password, we can echo out our friendly message to say "Welcome"; otherwise kill the page and say "You must be logged in!".
So, this is all in this part of the tutorial. Let me summarize this for you.
Remember, I'm not logged in.  So, let me login.
I am in.  There's my member page. I can log out.  I return here.
Now, as we've created "member dot php", press Enter.
It displays, "You must be logged in!".
So, for example, I'm going to log in but I'll not click here to go.
I'll just forward myself to "member dot php". Message has been created and I've been allowed access.
Okay so that's it for now. This is the last part of this tutorial. If you have any questions on this, I'll be more than happy to help.
This is Evan Varkey, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project. Bye.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Model Village : Hiware Bazar.
In this tutorial, we will learn about -
1. Problems faced by people of Hiware Bazar
2. Current condition of Hiware Bazar and
3. Practices that helped bring about these changes.
Problems faced by the people of Hiware Bazar:
The people of  Hiware Bazar' depended on rain for agriculture.
Heavy soil erosion had degraded the land quality.
Drinking water was scarcely available.
They did not have enough fodder.
Fuel wood was also unavailable.
These lead to a lot of social problems like:
Unemployment;
people were finding it difficult to get jobs.
Migration;
people started migrating from the village.
And increase in crime rate.
Current Condition in Hiware Bazar:
Per capita income increased from Rs 830 in 1995 to Rs 30,000 in 2012.
The village has 60 millionaires.
The number of families below poverty line decreased from 168 in 1995 to only 3 in 2012.
During the same period, milk production per day increased from 150 litres to 4000 litres.
Literacy rate has grown from 30% to 95%.
Crime rate has come down drastically.
And employment has increased.
Practices that helped improve the condition -
Five pronged approach or Panchsutri:
1. Free voluntary labour  or Shramdaan
2. Ban on grazing  or Charai bandi
3. Ban on tree-cutting  or  Kurhad bandi
4. Ban on liquor or Nasha Bandi
5. Family planning  or  Kutumb Niyojan
Shramdaan-
People started working together for community welfare.
Villagers developed a work culture.
They came together to construct check dams near the hills to reduce water flow speed.
Check dams helped in increasing the ground water level and reduce soil erosion.
CharaiBandi-
Overgrazing of cattle was banned.
Overgrazing leads to desertification  and soil erosion.
Ban on grazing
increased the production of grasses from 200 tonnes in 1994-95 to more than 5000-6000 tonnes in 2001-2002.
Kurhad Bandi-
Cutting of trees was banned.
Trees help in preventing soil erosion.
Soil erosion causes degradation of land and hence less farm produce.
Trees slow down rain water and help in increasing groundwater level.
Tree wastes are useful in increasing soil fertility.
Nasha Bandi-
22 liquor shops were closed.
Consumption of liquor and tobacco was completely banned.
Gram Sabha tied up with the banks to provide loans to those who had liquor shops.
Crime rate reduced.
People got involved in more productive work which helped the community.
Kutumb Niyojan -
A strict one child per family rule was imposed.
Birth rate has been reduced to 11 per thousand.
It  prevents pregnancy related health risks in women.
Family Planning also reduces infant mortality.
It helps empower people and enhance family education.
Family Planning is the key to creating a sustainable community.
From this tutorial, we can conclude that:
Collective effort of the village can bring great changes.
Panchsutri principles have proved to be very effective.
Following these practices can lead to creation of more such model villages.
The Spoken Tutorial project team: conducts workshops using spoken tutorials.
Spoken Tutorial Project is a part of the "Talk to a Teacher" project.
It is Supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT, MHRD, Government of India.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on BOSS Desktop.
In this tutorial, we will get familiar with the BOSS Desktop environment.
Here, I am using BOSS Linux 3.4.2 with wide Indian language support & packages.
Let me minimize the slide.
What you are seeing here, is the BOSS Desktop.
You can see the main menu on the top left hand side corner.
To open this menu, press Alt+F1 keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Alternately, click on Applications menu.
The 'Applications menu' contains all the installed applications in a categorized manner.
In this Applications menu, let us get familiar with some important applications.
So, let's go to Applications, Accessories, Calculator.
Calculator helps perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations.
Let's open the calculator by clicking on it.
Let us try some simple calculations.
Type 5*(into)8 and press '='(equals to) sign.
Instead of pressing '='(equals to) sign, you can also press the Enter key.
Now, exit this calculator by pressing the close button.
Now, let's look at another application.
For that, go back to Applications, then go to Accessories.
In Accessories, let's open gedit Text Editor by clicking on it.
So, what you see right now on screen is the gedit Text Editor.
Let me type some text here and save it.
Type: Hello World.
To save the file, I can press Crtl+S keys or go to File and then click on Save.
So, let me go to File and then click on Save.
The Save As dialog box opens up.
It prompts for filename and location in which the file has to be saved.
So, let me type the name as hello.txt and for location, I will select the Desktop.
Let's close this gedit window now and check whether our file is saved on the Desktop or not.
Now come to the Desktop and you can see the file "hello.txt" here.
So, our text file has got saved successfully.
Let me open this file by double-clicking on it.
Here is our text, "Hello World".
We can type in multiple local languages too, in the 'gedit Text Editor'.
In gedit Text Editor, press CTRL + SPACE BAR.
You can see a small box at the bottom right hand side.
Click on it.
Select 'Hindi'.
Inscript.
I will type hello world.
You can see the text has changed to Hindi Inscript.
Now I will select Hindi,  then I will select Phonetic.
I will type welcome using phonetics.
And you can see the word welcome typed in Hindi.
Now, click on Save to save the changes.
Let's close this text editor and let's see another important application from Accessories i.e Terminal.
So, let's move back to Applications, Accessories and then Terminal.
Terminal is called command line because you can command the computer from here.In fact, it is more powerful than the GUI.
Now let's type a simple command to get a feel of  Terminal.
So, let's type "ls" and press Enter.
You can see it lists all the files and folders in the current working directory.
Here it is displaying files and folders from the Home folder.
We will see later in this tutorial what the Home folder is.
Terminal commands are explained well in the subsequent Linux spoken tutorials in this series.
Let us close the Terminal now.
Now let's move on to another application i.e Iceweasel Web Browser.
This is the default web-browser on the BOSS Operating System.
Click on Applications >> Internet >> Iceweasel Web Browser.
Iceweasel is the re-branded version of Firefox.
Using this browser, you can access your emails or search for some information on the net.
Let's go to the google-site.
The short-cut key to go to the address bar is F6.
Or you can click here, on the address bar.
I will type www.google.co.in.
As I type, Iceweasel may suggest a few possibilities.
You may choose one of these...
... or continue to type the complete address and press Enter.
We are now in the google search page.  Let us type spoken tutorial in the search bar.
The spoken tutorial website is listed as the first option.  Let's click on it.
This will open the spoken tutorial Home page.
Let's close this and move on.
Now, let's click on Applications and then on Office.
In this Office menu, we have LibreOffice options like Writer, Calc and Impress.
These are the word processor, spreadsheet and presentation components of LibreOffice Suite.
The Spoken Tutorial website has spoken tutorials on these topics.  We suggest that you explore them.
Next, under Applications, let's explore Sound &Video menu.
This option lists the various player options available in BOSS OS.
You can use any of these options to play your video or audio files.
Now, let's see some other important things. Let's go to Places menu this time.
The first option here is the 'Home' folder.
Let's open it.
Every user has a unique Home folder in BOSS OS.
We can say that the Home folder is our house where we can store our files and folders.
Unless we permit, others cannot see them.
More information on file permissions is available in the 'Linux spoken tutorials', available on the spoken tutorial website.
In our Home folder, we can see other folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music etc.
In Linux, everything is a file.
Let's open the Desktop folder by double-clicking on it.
Hey, we can see that the same hello.txt file what we saved from gedit text editor is here.
So, this folder and the Desktop are the same.
Let me close this folder now.
Let's learn to change the Desktop theme now.
Go to the right hand side corner and click on the username displayed there.
In my case, the username is spoken.  So, I will click on spoken.
Now, click on System Settings option.
The System Settings dialog box opens up.
Click on Background icon.
Choose any background from the list displayed.
It will appear as your new background.
Close this dialog box.
Now, we will come to the System Tools option available under 'Applications' menu.
This menu has many important options which helps you to manage your desktop and the various applications.
Click on System tools >> Administration and Synaptic Package Manager.
It will immediately prompt you for the 'admin password' for authentication.
Type in your 'admin' password and click on Authenticate button.
Details on how to use Synaptic Package Manager is available in a separate tutorial in this series.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt about:
the BOSS Desktop, the main menu,
and many important features of BOSS Linux OS.
It summarizes the spoken tutorial project.

If you have already installed LibreOffice Suite,
you will find LibreOffice Writer by clicking on the Applications option at the top left corner of your screen
and then clicking on Office and then on the LibreOffice option.
A new dialog-box opens up with various LibreOffice components.
In order to access LibreOffice Writer, click on the Text Document option which is the word processor component of the suite.
This will open an empty document in the main Writer window.
The Writer window has various tool bars like the title bar,
the menu bar, the standard toolbar,
the formatting bar and the status bar which have the most commonly used options which we will learn about, as the tutorials progress.
Now, let us start the tutorial by learning how to open a new document in 'Writer'.
You can open a new document by clicking on the New icon in the standard toolbar
or by clicking on the File option in the menu bar
and then clicking on the New option and then finally clicking on the Text document option.
You see that a new Writer window opens up in both the cases.
Now, type some text in the editor area.
So, we will type: "RESUME".
Once done writing your document, you should save it for future use.
To save this file, click on File in the menu bar
and then click on the Save As option.
A new dialog-box appears on the screen where you are required to enter the name of your file, under the Name field.
So, enter the name of the file as "resume".
Below the Name field, you have the Save in folder
field where you are required to enter the folder name which will contain your saved file.
You see a list of folders appears in the menu where you can save your file.
Now, let us click on the Desktop option. The file will be saved on the desktop.
You can also click on Browse for other folders
and choose the folder in which you want to save your document.
Now click on the File type option in the dialog-box.
It shows you a list of file type options or file extensions under which you can save your file.
ODT belongs to the Open Document Format or the ODF format which is a globally accepted open standard for word documents.
It is also accepted by the Government of India policy on open standards in e-Governance
Besides saving as dot odt text documents, which can be opened in LibreOffice Writer,
you can also save your file as dot doc and as dot docx format which can be opened in the MS Office Word program.
Another popular file extension which opens in most programs is dot rtf which is the Rich Text Format.
Now, click on the ODF Text Document option.
You see that the file type- ODF Text Document and within brackets dot odt, gets displayed next to the File type' option.
Now click on the Save button.
This takes you back to the Writer window with the filename and the extension of your choice on the title bar.
You are now ready to write a text document in Writer window.
In addition to the  formats discussed above, the Writer documents can also be saved in dot html' format which is a web-page format.
So, click on the File option in the menu bar and then click on the Save As option.
Now, click on the File Type option and then click on the HTML Document and within braces 'Open Office dot org Writer' option.
Now, put a check on the "Ask when not saving in ODF format"option in the dialog-box.
Finally, click on the "Keep Current Format" option.
As before, choose the location where you wish to save.
Alternately, you can do so by clicking on the File option in the menu bar and then clicking on the Export as pdf option.

Hello everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Writing Sequence Files.
In this tutorial, we will learn: * How to create Sequence Record Objects
Write sequences files
Convert between file formats
And, sort records in a file by length.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with
undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0 and * Biopython version 1.64.
We have earlier learnt about parse and read functions to read contents of a file.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use write function to write sequences to a file.
And, use Convert function for inter-conversion between various file formats.
Let me now demonstrate how to use write function.
Here is a text file with a protein sequence.
The sequence shown here is insulin protein.
The file also has information such as GI accession number and also description.
We will now create a file for this sequence in FASTA format.
The first step is to create sequence record object.
More information about Sequence Record Objects:
It is the basic data type for the sequence input/output interface.
In sequence record object, a sequence is associated with higher level features such as identifiers and descriptions.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously .
At the prompt, type: ipython, press Enter.
At the prompt, type the following lines:
from Bio dot Seq module import Seq class.
from Bio dot SeqRecord module import Sequence Record class
Next, from Bio dot Alphabet module import generic protein class.
Next, I will save the sequence record object in a variable record1.
Copy the sequence, id and description from the text file and paste it in the respective lines on the terminal.
To view the output, type: record1.
The output shows the insulin protein sequence as sequence record object.
It shows the sequence along with id and description.
We will use write function to convert the above sequence record object to a FASTA file.
Import SeqIO module from Bio package.
Next, type the command line with a write function to convert the sequence object to FASTA file.
The write function takes 3 arguments.
The first one is the variable storing the sequence record object.
The second is the file name to write the FASTA file.
The third is the file format to write. Press Enter.
The Output shows one, that is, we have converted one sequence record object to a FASTA file.
The file in FASTA format is saved in the home folder as "example.fasta".
Let me warn you,the output will over-write any pre-existing file of the same name.
To view the file, navigate to the file in the home folder.
Open this file in a text editor.
The protein sequence is now in FASTA format.
Close the text editor.
Many bioinformatics tools take different input file formats.
So, sometimes there is a need to inter-convert between sequence file formats.
We can do file conversions using convert function in SeqIO module.
For demonstration, I will convert a GenBank file to a FASTA file.
Have a GenBank file in my home folder.
Let me open this in a text editor.
The file contains HIV genome in GenBank format.
This GenBank file has descriptions of all the genes in the genome, in the first part of the file.
It is followed by a complete genome sequence.
Close the text editor. Type the following lines on the terminal.
Here the convert function converts the complete genome sequence present in the GenBank file to FASTA file. Press Enter.
The new file in the FASTA format is now saved as HIV.fasta in the home folder.
Navigate to the file and open in the text editor.
Close the text editor.
Even though we can convert the file formats easily using convert function, it has limitations.
Writing some formats requires information which other file formats don’t contain.
For example: We can convert a GenBank file to a FASTA file, we can't do the reverse.
Similarly, we can turn a FASTQ file into a FASTA file but can’t do the reverse.
For more information regarding convert function, type the help command.
Press 'q' on the key board to get back to the prompt.
We can also extract individual genes from the HIV genome in GenBank format.
These individual genes can be saved in FASTA or any other formats.
For this, type the following code at the prompt.
This code will write all individual CDS gene sequences, their ids and name of the gene in a file.
The file is saved as “HIV_geneseq.fasta” in your home folder. Press Enter.
Using Biopython tools, we can sort the records in a file by length.
Here, I have opened a FASTA file “hemoglobin.fasta” which has six records.
Each record is of a different length.
Type the following lines to arrange the longest record first.
The new file with the sorted sequences will be saved as "sorted_hemoglobin.fasta" in your home folder.
For short records first, reverse the arguments in the records.sort command line.
Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt :* to create Sequence Record Objects
Write sequence files using write function of Sequence Input/Output module.
Convert between sequence file formats using convert function.
And, sort records in a file by length.
For the assignment:
Extract the gene "HIV1gp3" at positions 4587 to 5165 from the genomic sequence of HIV.
The file “HIV.gb” is included in the code files of this tutorial.
Your completed assignment will have the following code.
Please download and watch it. The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops and gives certificates for those who pass an online test.
Welcome to this tutorial on a page counter.
This will count how many people have visited your page per refresh.
So every time someone enters the page, a value will be incremented, will be stored in a text file and it will be displayed to the user.
Or you can keep it to yourself. It's your choice whether you want to display.
Please note, this is a very simple way of doing this.
It won't count unique visitors.
I'll make a unique visitors tutorial soon.
It'll be probably  available by the time you are viewing this.
So check it out.  It will be more specific.
It deals with IP addresses.
However, for now, this is a basic counter tutorial and it's using file-storage as opposed to database-storage.
Ok. So the first thing we need to do is- create a file in which to store our value in.
There are 2 ways to do this.
Either right-click and create a new text document.
Or what I'll show you is how to create a file for opening which is the function fopen().
And we'll store it in the $file variable.  But it's not mandatory.
And we'll say "count.php" and another parameter for this is whether you want it for writing, for reading or to append that, for example.
So, I'll say for writing.
Ok.  Now I'll say fwrite() and I'll write to $file and I'll create a value of zero.
So, now we'll open our page-up and refresh.
We've got "counter.php".  Click on that and when we go back, see if we've got count.php.
So, ".txt".
So, let's refresh this.
Ok, so now we should have a ".txt" file.
Let me remove this - "count.php".
Now we've done that and we really don't need this code.
So, I'll delete this part but I'll retain this and now I'll say I want to read from the file.
You could type this manually also. You just have to create a file for writing instead of reading.
So, we've got our file and we've got our value of zero in it.
So, let's open it and see.
Yes, we've got "count.txt" with zero that will read this and put it into that.
So, now, I need to get the contents of the file.
So, instead of fopen() I'll say, 'file_get_contents()'.
So, I'll type 'file_get_contents'.
And that will get the contents of 'count.txt'.
Ok.  Then I'll say echo and use the variable and I'll say echo $file.
Now what this will do is it will say file_get_contents and it will get the contents of our text file with our count variable in there.
And it will say echo out the contents of the $file.
So, let's go back to our page and we will refresh.
Click on "counter" and we've got zero at the moment.
Refreshing.  It's still staying at zero as displayed here.
If I change this to 'hello' and I went back to our page and refreshed, it'll have the value 'hello'.
So, we are just echoing out whatever is in this text file at the moment.
And right now it's zero - the integer zero.
Now to echo this, I'll have to say "You've had $file visitors".
So, that will give us something like that.
Now, what I'll do is I will create a new variable called $visitors.
And I'll say that is equal to $file.
I'll put this up here to be more efficient and easy to read as well.
And I'll say '$visitors' and we can tell what this is going to be.
And then what we'll say is $visitors.
Visit-ors - new - equals this $visitors plus 1.
So, this will be our new value.
Then I'll go ahead and say $filenew, so I'm creating a new file.
I'll open that as "count.txt" because that's what it is.
And I'll say to write this file.
Now if it was 'a+' that means 'append' - so I'm appending something onto the file which means that I'm adding to it.
What I want to do is overwrite, so I'll put 'w'.
And then I'll say 'fwrite()' like we did in our first part - to '$filenew'
and the value that I need to write is '$visitorsnew'.
This is going to work.  Let's just go through it before you run it.
We've got our main file and that's getting the contents of our "count.txt" which is zero at the moment.
We're setting our variable called '$visitors' to the contents of the '$file'.
We're echoing out to the user how many visitors there have been.
And we're creating a new variable with the 'visitors + 1' - namely the person that is viewing this page at the moment.
That becomes significant.  That's the person adding the extra 1 in there.
And then we're opening a new file as we saw in the start of this tutorial but instead we're using 'w' for write.
And then we're writing to our new file the new value which is increment of 1.
So, let's refresh and you can see - oh!.
It's not working!Ok, so let's check this code.
Let's check the spelling of visitors - Visit-ors new.  Ok.  Visit-ors.
That's the reason.  I had to put a 'n' in there.
So, "count.txt".Now this time, we are adding 1 each time we refresh.
So you can see that the value is in fact going up.
Now obviously to reset this, all you would have to do is -
Ah! a warning. 'count.txt' has been changed because we have edited it.
I'll say 'reload from disk'.
And it's changed to 19, as you can see, it displayed 18 there.
The reason is that we're echoing this out before we put our new value in.
So, for maximum efficiency and to get the actual correct value, I'll put this code down there.
As a matter of fact, when I am refreshing here and let's say- we get to 25 visitors and we come back here, we'll have the value 26.
Ok, well, may be I'm being a little disorganized here.
There's no major efficient way to do it.
This will always echo out '$visitors'.
So just for variation, we'll say '$visitorsnew'.
So, this will equal exactly - oh no!
visitors new - another spelling mistake.
Right, so let's increment to 35 and we're going to contents and this value equals 35.
Position isn't everything when you have to deal with a code as simple as this but it does help.
Ok - so that's the basic tutorial.
If you'd like to get any help on it, then please get in touch.
But for now, try this out, give it a go.
Also watch my other tutorial on the more advanced counter that takes IP addresses into account.
Thanks for watching.  This is Osama Butt, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.
Access other Data Sources
Register '.odb' databases
View Data sources
And Use Data Sources in Writer.
Let us see how we can access other Data Sources in Base.
Libre Office allows other data sources to be accessed apart from Base Databases.
It also allows to link them into other Libre Office documents.
For example, we can access a spreadsheet or a simple text document from inside LibreOffice Base.
And then link them into a LibreOffice Writer document.
As an example, let us create an example spreadsheet using LibreOffice Calc.
Click on Start Menu >> All Programs and open the LibreOffice Suite menu.
Or, if LibreOffice is already open then we can click on File, New and then Spreadsheet to open a new spreadsheet.
Now, in the spreadsheet, let us type in some sample data as shown in the image. <pause>
And save this spreadsheet as ‘LibraryMembers’ in a directory location.
Now, let us remember the location as we will need to use this file later in our example.
And we will close the Calc window.
Okay, now let us see how we can access this spreadsheet from 'LibreOffice Base'.
To do this, open Base either from Windows Start menu
or if LibreOffice is already open then we will click on File, New and then Database.
Now, this opens the Database Wizard.
Here, we will click on the ‘Connect to an existing database’
then click on the drop-down.
Notice the various database sources in this list that Base can access.
And we will click on Spreadsheet here.
And the Next button.
Now, using the browse button, let us locate the spreadsheet from where we saved it earlier.
If there is a password for the spreadsheet, we will need to provide it too.
Here we won’t need it.
Let us click on the Next button.
Now let us register the spreadsheet as a data source
and open it for editing.
And, click on the Finish button.
Now, let us provide a database name here. Let us type in "LibraryMembers".
Notice the Save as type: It says ODF Database which is '.odb' in our case.
And Save it in the same location as the spreadsheet.
There we have registered the spreadsheet as a data source in Base.
We are in the main Base window now.
Here, let us click on the Tables icon in the left panel.
Notice the tables ‘Sheet1’, Sheet2, and 'Sheet3'.
Let us double-click on Sheet1 to open it and here is the data from the spreadsheet.
Now, with this method of accessing the Spreadsheet, we cannot make any changes from here.
We can only view data or create queries and reports based on the existing data from here.
So, changes have to be made directly to the Spreadsheet itself.
Registering '.odb' databases.
Now, there are other programs such as OpenOffice.org that can produce '.odb' databases.
To use these inside LibreOffice Base, we will first need to register them in Base.
To register any '.odb' database, we will need to open Base and
choose Tools, Options, LibreOffice Base and Databases.
Under Registered Databases, click New.
Browse to where the database is located and ensure the registered name is correct
and Click on the OK button.
Let us see how we can view Data sources in LibreOffice.
For this, let us consider the example spreadsheet that we registered in Base.
Now, we can use it in LibreOffice Writer or Calc.
For example, let us see how we can view it inside 'LibreOffice Writer'.
First, let us open Writer from the 'Base' window.
For this, let us click on File, New and then Text Document.
Now we are in the Writer window.
To view the available data sources, we will click on the View menu at the top and click on Data Sources.
Alternately, we can press the F4 key.
Now we see a list of registered databases at the top left, including "LibraryMembers" which we created just now.
To view the database, we will expand it by clicking on the plus symbol on the left of the database name
and we will expand Tables.
Here are Sheet1, 2 and 3.
Let us click on Sheet 1.
So, that’s our data at the top right of the Writer window.
Now we will see how we can use this data in our example Writer document.
Okay, here if we want to use all of the data from the table above then first we will select all the records there.
For this, let us click on the gray cell to the left of the first column in the first record.
Then, while pressing Shift key, we will click on the gray cell to the left of the first column in the last record.
Notice that all the data gets highlighted.
Now we will click, drag and drop this onto the Writer document below.
Next, we see a pop-up window titled Insert Database columns.
So here, we will click on the Table option at the top
and then click on the double-arrow button to move all the fields from the left to the right list.
Notice the various choices here.
For now, we will simply click on the OK button.
And here is the entire table of data in the document.
Next, let us see how we can insert individual fields.
Let us go to the top of the Writer document and press the Enter key twice. Again, go to the top left.
Here, let us type in "Member Name" colon.
And then click on the Name column in the data sources area at the top right.
Now we will click, drag and drop it next to the text we typed.
And we will press the Tab key and type in "Phone number" colon.
And..... we know what to do, don’t we?
We will click and drag the Phone column from the top and drop it next to our text.
Then let us highlight the first record by clicking the gray cell to the left of the first record.
And then, we will click on the Data to Fields icon.
This can be found in the Table Data toolbar at the top, below the Formatting toolbar.
Notice that the data in the table above is now in the Writer document.
To bring in another record, we just have to highlight a different record and use the Data to Fields icon again.
So, there we learnt how to use data sources inside LibreOffice documents.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Accessing other Data Sources in LibreOffice Base.

Hello Everybody. Welcome to the tutorial on LibreOffice Writer - Track changes while Editing a document.
In this tutorial, I will explain how peer review of documents can be done with LibreOffice Writer.
We will open an existing document to explain how to peer review and edit a document using Record Changes option.
The benefit in using this feature is that a reviewer can give comments, add text, delete or modify existing text which is clearly visible as such, in the same document.
This can be easily seen by the author who can accept or reject these changes and thus incorporate these edit comments without the effort of making the  changes once again.
And when the file is saved, the comments are incorporated.
So, let's learn how to do all of this.
In this tutorial, I will be using some documents that I have already created and saved on my system, namely -
'Seven-reasons-to-adopt-FOSS.odt', 'Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt'.
click on Applications >> Office >> LibreOffice Writer to start Writer.
Open 'Seven-reasons-to-adopt-FOSS.odt'.
To set the Record changes option on, go to Edit → Changes and check the Record option.
The Show option should also be checked. This will enable any subsequent editing to be recorded distinctly.
In the document, let us insert a second point.
We will go to point number 2 and type: "Linux is a virus resistant operating system since each user has a distinct data space and cannot directly access the program files".
Hit Enter so that the current second point becomes point number 3.
Note that the text input has come in a new color.
Hover the mouse over this text. You will see the message "Inserted sriranjani:" followed by date and time of insertion.
Thus the person making the comment is identified in the document. The name is provided based on the name given during installation of LibreOffice as the user on the computer.
Correct the spelling of "avalable" in the first line. You will notice the correction.
Delete the first point - It can be installed on all computers without restriction or needing to pay license fees to vendors.
Note that the deletion does not actually delete the line, but marks it as a line suggested for deletion.
Hover the cursor over it and we see the message: "Deleted sriranjani", followed by date and time of deletion.
In this manner, modifications can be made to a document by adding, deleting or changing an existing text in a document.
More than one person can edit the same document.
LO Writer will show each edit in a different colour to help the reader distinguish one reviewer's work from another.
Of course, hovering the mouse over the edited text will display the name of the reviewer.
I am going to demonstrate this by opening a document which is already been edited by my colleague Guru.
Open a text file document 'Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt'.
In this document, we can see that several additions and deletions have been done.
Hovering the mouse over this text gives the message that the addition and deletion have been done by Guru.
Add a point at the bottom "CDAC, NIC, NRC-FOSS are institutions of Government of India which develop and promote FOSS".
We can see that the colour of this insertion is different from the colour of the edits done by Guru.
Hovering the mouse over this insertion gives the message "Inserted: sriranjani".
Thus more than one person can edit the same document before it goes back to the author.
Close the document without saving it.
We will now show how the author can accept or reject changes made by the reviewer.
In the same document- 'Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt', let's assume I am the author and I will accept or reject the edits made by Guru.
Go to point 2 and right-click on the deleted text "reasons" and say Accept Change.
You will see that the text gets deleted which is the change suggested by the reviewer.
Right-click on the inserted text "needs" and select Accept Change. You will see that the text becomes normal which is the change suggested by the reviewer.
In this way, edits suggested by the reviewer- both insertions and deletions can be accepted by the author.
Go to point number 1 and right-click on the deleted text "The OpenOffice document standard (ODF) has been notified under this policy" and select Reject change.
This makes the text normal i.e. the suggestion of the reviewer to delete, has been rejected by the author.
Go to point number 5 and right-click on "Government Schools in these states and in Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu learn Linux" and select Reject change.
This deletes the text inserted by the reviewer.
In this manner, each addition or deletion can be accepted or rejected by the author.
Finally, after accepting or rejecting changes, we should go to Edit >> Changes and uncheck the Record and Show options.
When unchecked, any further editing will not be marked separately.
Please be sure to save the file after accepting or rejecting changes to incorporate all comments given by the reviewers.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Finally, the ASSIGNMENT-
Open a document and make corrections to spelling mistakes in Record Changes mode.
I have already constructed this assignment here.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Tagging in Git.
To follow this tutorial-
Let us learn about tagging.
Tagging is used to mark a commit stage as important.
We can tag a commit, like a bookmark, for future references.
Typically, this is used to mark release point of a project such as v1.0.
There are two types of tags:
First, I will demonstrate how to create a lightweight tag.
Let us go to our Git repository mywebpage which we created earlier.
Switch back to the terminal and type: cd space mywebpage and press Enter.
Let’s check the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
Currently, we have three commits in our repository ,namely- "Added colors, Added history.html" and the "Initial commit".
Now, I will create a lightweight tag in the latest commit “Added colors”.
When we create a tag, by default, it will be created in the latest commit.
Type: git space tag space v1.1 and press Enter.
Here, I will give v1.1 as the tag name. You can give any name of your choice.
You can see the tag by typing git space tag and press Enter.
Now, we have only one tag in our repository.
Next, we will learn how to create an annotated tag.
First, I will make some modifications in the file mypage.html for demonstration purpose.
Type: gedit space mypage.html space ampersand and press Enter. Let us add some lines in the file.
Let’s commit our work at this point.
Type: git space commit space hyphen a m space  within double quotes “Added content in mypage.html” and press Enter.
Let us assume that this particular stage is very important to the project.
So, we have to create a tag at this commit point.
Here, we will create an annotated tag.
Type: git space tag space hyphen a space v1.2 space hyphen m space within double quotes “My Version 1.2” and press Enter.
Using -m flag, you can give any tag message of your choice.
Here, the tag message is optional.
To see the tag list, type: git space tag and press Enter. Now we have two tags.
Here, v1.1 is the lightweight tag and v1.2 is the annotated tag.
How do we differentiate between the tags?
We can see the difference between the two tags by using git show command.
Type: git space show space v1.1 and press Enter.
Here, we can see the complete details of the lightweight tag v1.1.
It simply shows the commit details and the file changes.
Next, we will see the details of the annotated tag v1.2. Type: git space show space v1.2 and press Enter.
Here we can see the:
Annotated tag is always recommended when you work collaboratively.
Let us now learn how to mark a tag in our old commits.
First, we will check the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
Now, for instance, I want to create a tag in my second commit “Added history.html”.
Type: git space tag space hyphen a space v1.0 space. Then, copy and paste the commit hash of the “Added history.html” space type: hyphen m space within double quotes “My Version 1.0” and press Enter.
We will be able to see the tag which we created now, by typing git space tag and press Enter.
You can see the tag v1.0 is created here.
Next, we will learn how to see the tags along with the Git log.
Type: git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline space hyphen hyphen decorate and press Enter.
You can see the Git log along with the tag names.
Now, we will learn to delete an unwanted tag.
Say, I want to delete the tag v1.1.
Type: git space tag space hyphen d space v1.1 and press Enter.
It shows the message “Deleted tag 'v1.1'” and its commit hash.
We will check whether the tag is deleted or not.
Type: git space tag and press Enter.
Now, we can't see the tag v1.1 as it has been deleted successfully.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:

If it's 'Not True', we'll say else.
and I'll say Access granted.
If this equals 'def', we're going to say Access granted else Access denied.
To me, that looks a lot neater.
$access equals "Allowed".

create a Subform.
For this, let us continue with our familiar Library database example.
And we will consider the following case:
How can we list all the members of the library?
And for each member, how can we see only those books that have not yet been returned by that member?
One way is to create a form listing all the members in the library.
And then creating a subform below it, to list those books that have not yet been returned by the member.
Once we design this form, we will be able to update the form.
For example, when a member returns a book, we can update this information.
And, here is a sample screenshot of the form we will design.
Notice, it also shows a subform at the bottom.
Let's open our Library database.
In our previous tutorials, we created the ‘History of Books Issued to Members’ query.
Now we will use this query and the Members table as the base for creating our new form.
Let us first copy this query by right-clicking on the query name and then let us click on Paste.
In the pop-up window for query name, let us type in a new name: ‘Books Not Returned’
Let us now open the ‘Books Not Returned’ query in edit mode.
In the Query Design window, let us add a criterion to show only those books that are not checked-in.
For this, let us type ‘equals 0’ in the Criterion column, under CheckedIn.
And press Enter.
Let us now save the query and close the window.
In the main Base window, let us click on the Forms icon on the left panel.
And then click on the ‘Use Wizard to create Form’ option.
Now we see the familiar Form wizard.
Let us go through the 8 steps on the left to create our form.
In step 1. field selection, let us choose Table: Members.
Then let us move all the fields to the right side.
And let us click on the Next button.
We are in Step 2. Setup a subform.
So here, let us check the ‘Add subform’ check-box
and click on the option: ‘Subform based on manual selection of fields’.
Let us go to Step 3. Add subform fields.
Here we will call our new query which we designed a few minutes ago.
So, let us choose ‘Query: Books Not Returned’ from the Tables or Queries drop-down.
And we will move selected fields from the available list to the right side as shown on the screen. <pause>
Step 4. Get joined fields.
Here we will choose the MemberId field from the top two drop-downs, as this is the only relating field.
And click on the Next button.
Step 5. Arrange Controls.
Here, we will choose the third option- Data sheet, for both the form and the subform.
And click on the Next button.
Step 6. Set data entry.
Here, we will leave the options as they are and click on Next.
Step 7. Apply Styles.
Let us choose Grey as the form background.
And go to the final step.
Step 8. Set Name.
Here, let us give a descriptive name to our form: ‘Members Who Need to Return Books’.
And let us click on the Modify form option, as we are going to do some more changes.
Now let's click on the Finish button.
In the Form Design window, notice that there are two tabular data sheet areas.
The one above is called the form and the one below is called the subform.
Now, let us add a label above the form.
We will click on the Label icon in the Form Controls toolbar at the top and draw it on the form.
Double clicking on the label, brings up its properties.
Here we will type ‘Members of the Library’ against label
and change the font style to Arial, Bold and Size 12. <pause>
Similarly, let us add a second label above the subform as shown on the screen
and call it ‘List of Books to be returned by the member’. <pause>
Next, let us shorten the form’s length as shown on the screen.
And then let us increase the length of the Name field in the form. <pause>
Similarly, let us lengthen the Book title field in the subform.
Let us change the fonts here to Arial, Bold and Size 8.
And change the background color to white for the form and Blue 8 for the subform. <pause>
Next, let us hide the MemberId column by right-clicking on it and choosing the Hide column option.
Okay, we are done. So, let us save the form design and test it.
In the main Base window, let us open the ‘Members Who Need to Return Books’ form by double-clicking on it.
There is the form.
Let us browse through the members by either using the up or down arrow keys,
or by simply clicking on the various member names.
Notice that the subform below refreshes and shows books to be returned.
In the subform, let us choose any record
and let us type in ‘12/7/11’ in the ActualReturnDate field and check the CheckedIn field
Let us now refresh the form by clicking on the Refresh icon in the Form Navigation toolbar at the bottom.
Notice that the record we just edited is no longer listed here
which means the book has been returned or checked-in.
So, there is our form with a subform.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Subforms in LibreOffice Base.
create a Subform.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Advanced matrix operations.
In this tutorial, you will learn to, find Frobenius and infinity norm of a matrix
Find singular value decomposition of a matrix.
Python 3.4.3 and  IPython 5.1.0
To practise this tutorial, you should know about
First we will see about flatten function.
flatten() function returns a copy of the array, collapsed into one dimension.
It can be used to convert a multidimensional matrix into a single dimension matrix
Type, ipython3 and press Enter.
Now let us see how to create arrays
Type from numpy import asmatrix comma arange
a is equal to asmatrix inside brackets arange inside brackets 1 comma 10 dot reshape inside brackets 3 comma 3
Then type, a
First we imported arange function from numpy module.
Here, we can see 3 by 3 matrix is converted into one dimensional matrix.
Next we will see about frobenius norm.
It is defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements.
Find out the frobenius norm of the inverse of the given 4 by 4 matrix.
Type
Here, we have used asmatrix, arange and reshape functions.
We created a matrix of size 4 by 4 containing elements from 1 to 16.
Now type,
m inside square brackets 1 comma 3 is equal to 0
Then type, m
In order to find out the Frobenius norm of the inverse of matrix m, type as shown.
norm function is available in numpy.linalg module.
Next, we will see about infinity norm of a matrix.
It is defined as the maximum value of sum of the absolute value of elements in each row.
Find the infinity norm of the matrix  im.
To find out the Infinity norm of the matrix im, type as shown.
Here value for ord parameter is passed as inf to calculate infinity norm.
To know more about norms type norm question mark
Next we will see about singular value decomposition.
In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition is factorization of real or complex matrix.
The SVD of matrix m1 can be found using svd function available in the numpy.linalg module.
svd returns a tuple of 3 elements.
We have unpacked these values into variable U, sigma and V underscore conjugate.
Type, Capital U
Type, sigma
Type, Capital V underscore conjugate
We can validate the singular value decomposition by comparing the product of:
sigma is a one dimensional array which contains only the diagonal elements of the matrix.
Type smat
Now type, smat inside square brackets colon 2 comma colon 2 is equal to diag inside brackets sigma
Then type smat
This replaces values at row 0 column 0 and row 1 column 1 in smat with values from sigma.
smat is a 2 by 3 matrix created for multiplications by placing values of sigma as diagonal elements and zero elsewhere.
It returns True.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,  Calculate the norm of a matrix using the function norm()
Calculate SVD of a matrix using the function svd()
Here is a self assessment question for you to solve
And the answer is True, since the order is equal to inside single quotes fro stands for Frobenius norm.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Introduction to K3b.
In this tutorial, you will learn about
the K3b interface and various toolbars.
You will also learn how to download and install K3b on the Ubuntu Linux Operating System and
Burn a sample file using K3b.
What is K3b?
K3b is a CD/DVD burning software.
It can perform simple tasks like burning a CD to complex tasks such as burning eMovix CDs.
It can create a data, an audio or a video CD/DVD.
K3b supports all data formats such as ".html", ".txt" and so on.
It supports all audio and video formats such as mp3, MPEG and so on.
For more information about K3b, please visit 'www.k3b.org'.
Here, we are using K3b 2.0.2 on Ubuntu Linux 12.04.
You need to ensure that you have inserted a CD or a DVD into the drive for this tutorial.
If you do not have K3b installed, you can do so by using Ubuntu Software Centre.
For details on Ubuntu Software Centre, please refer to the spoken tutorial website.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we have created a folder called "Myk3bCD" on the Desktop.
We have also saved 4 Writer, 1 Impress and 2 Calc files in this folder.
While practicing, you can use any folder or file of your choice.
Now let’s open K3b.
Now, type k3b.
The K3b icon appears.
The "K3b" window opens.
Let us familiarize ourselves with the K3b interface.
The K3b interface has a main menu with various options.
Shortcut icons are available below the main menu such as-
New Project, Open, Save, Format and Filter.
K3b is divided into two main panels, the top and bottom panels.
The top panel is also divided into two panels.
The left panel displays the main folders in your computer...
and the right panel displays the corresponding sub-folders.
The bottom panel displays shortcut icons for the most common processes used in K3b.
You can add shortcut icons of the processes that you commonly use to this panel.
Let’s add a shortcut icon to create a new video CD project.
Place the cursor on the bottom panel.
Right-click for the context menu.
Click New Video CD Project.
The shortcut icon for New Video CD Project appears on the panel.
Now, let's burn a Data CD.
In the bottom pane, double-click on New Data Project.
Alternately, go to New Project and click on the drop-down list.
Select New Data Project.
From the left panel, select Home and Desktop.
Now, select the "Myk3bCD" folder.
It opens up all the files and folders on the top right panel.
Let us select the data file to be burned.
Let’s choose  the file Writer4 from this folder.
Drag and drop  the file Writer4 to the bottom panel.
Ensure that you have inserted a CD or a DVD into the drive before proceeding further.
Click Burn.
Again click Burn.
A window appears with 3 different tabs.
Let us keep the default settings.
So, click Default Settings.
Now, we can see the burning status and the progress status.
Once burning completes, CD ejects automatically.
Isn’t it simple?
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on K3b.
In this tutorial, we learnt about the K3b interface and its toolbars.
We also learnt how to: download and install K3b,
use various feature in K3b,
burn a file onto a CD.
Burn an Audio file onto a CD.

Dear friends, welcome to a spoken tutorial on the Linux Operating System.
In this tutorial, we will study some basic commands.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system.
If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial, on the website
In this tutorial, we will see what are commands and what is a command interpreter.
Then we will learn about how to find help in Linux using the man command.
Now the first question is, "what are commands?".
In simplest terms we can say that Linux commands are words that when keyed in cause some actions to take place.
Linux commands are seldom more than four character in length, like  ls, who, ps etc.
The commands are in lower case and they are case sensitive. Let us see an example .
Go to the Applications menu.
Select Accessories and then click on Terminal from the available options.
Now we can see a prompt ($) and a cursor blinking next to it. This is where we need to type in a command.
Type the word who and press Enter.
We can see the name of the users logged in. Actually we have just executed a command called who which shows who are logged into the system.
But which entity is converting these commands which are nothing more than a few letters into actions?
This is the job of the Command Interpreter, also called the shell.
We can define a shell as a program that acts as the interface between us and the Linux system,
allowing us to enter commands for the operating system to execute.
On Linux it’s quite feasible to have multiple shells installed, with different users able to pick the one they prefer.
On Linux, the standard shell that is always installed as bin/sh is called bash, the GNU Bourne-Again Shell, from the GNU suite of tools.
The commands we would be covering in this tutorial are generic and can run on most of the Linux shells with slight variations.
Nevertheless, we would be using the bash as the shell for demonstration in this tutorial.
It is because bash is the most popular shell and portable to almost all UNIX.
Other shells include the Bourne shell which is the original  Unix shell, C Shell and the Korn shell.
To see which shell we are using, go to the terminal
and type the command:  echo space dollar in capital SHELL and press Enter.
Normally, the output is /bin/bash which gives us the bash shell.
There are ways by which we can activate different shells. Those will be covered in an advanced tutorial.
Commands are actually files containing programs, often written in C.
These files are contained in directories. To find out where a command is stored, we can use the type command.
Type at the command prompt:  type space ps and press Enter.
This shows that ps is actually a file, stored in the /bin directory.
When we key in a command at the command prompt, the shell searches for a file matching the command name in a list of directories.
If it is found, then the program corresponding to that file is executed, else a “command not found” error is given.
The list of directories searched is specified by the PATH variable, as we will see later.
For now, if we want to see this list, just type the command echo space dollar PATH  in capital.
Talking of commands, there is one important thing that we need to know.
Linux commands are of two types: External commands and internal commands.
Now external commands are those which exist as separate files/programs.
Most commands in Linux are of this nature. But, there are some commands whose implementation is written within the shell and they do not exist as separate files.
These are internal commands.
The echo command which we will see later, is in fact an internal command.
Go to the terminal and type the command:
type space echo and press Enter.
The output shows: "echo as a shell built-in".
So, instead of giving a file name it shows that the echo command's implementation is internal to the shell. So, it is called internal command.
Another important thing which we need to understand is the structure of commands.
Commands can be of one word or multiple words, separated by white spaces.
In the second case, the first word is the actual name of the command while the other words are the arguments.
Arguments can be options or expressions or file names.
A command can perform different tasks depending on the option specified.
They are generally preceded by a single or double minus sign called short and long option respectively.
Go to the terminal window and type the commands and see their outputs.
Type clear to clear the terminal window.
Then type ls and press Enter.
Again, type clear and press Enter.
Type ls space minus a and Enter.
Type clear to clear the terminal window.
Now type ls space minus minus all and press Enter.
Again, type clear to clear the terminal .
Now type ls space minus d and press Enter.
At this point, it is enough to understand how the command's behavior changes with change of options.
In Linux, we have a large number of commands
each of which have many different options.
Commands can also be combined together as we will see later. So, how do we keep so much in mind?
In reality you don't have to. This is because of the excellent online help facility available in Linux.
The man command provides documentation on just about every available command on the system.
For instance, to know about say- the ls command, all you have to do is to go to the terminal
and type man command with ls as argument, that is type man space ls and press Enter.
Press q to come out.
man is the system’s manual pager. Each argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.
The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.
A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.
The default is to search in all of the available sections, following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.
You can use man command to know more about the command man itself.
Go to the terminal and type man space man and press Enter.
Press q to come out of it.
man command has many options.
Here, let me tell the most useful ones. Sometimes, we know what we want to do but we do not know the exact command. Then what can we do?
man provides the -k option which takes a keyword and returns a list of commands and their brief purpose.
For example, create a directory; we may not know the exact command.
So, we can go to the command prompt and type man space minus k space directories and press Enter.
Now we can search each of these commands to see what we actually need.
The same thing can be achieved using apropos command.
Type at the command prompt: apropos space directories and press Enter to see the output.
Sometimes, we do not need too much details. We only need to know what a command does.
In that case, we can use the whatis command or man -f. Both give one line description about the command.
Go to the terminal, type clear to clear the terminal window.
Now, type: whatis space ls and press Enter.
Some commands have many options. We may want to obtain a list of the different options that a command has.
Then we use the  - - (minus minus) help  option.
Go to the command prompt and type ls space - -(minus minus) help  and press Enter.
I will scroll up so that you can see all the options on this manual page.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on how to use Perl Module Library  i.e. CPAN
In this tutorial, we will learn to use existing modules and  create new modules in PERL.
Modules:
CPAN:PERL is an open source language and anyone can contribute to PERL's standard CPAN library.
CPAN has thousands of ready-to-use modules written by different authors.
The official website of CPAN is:
We will take List colon colon Util as an example and see how to use it.
This gives me access to the functions which are already written inside this module.
Type: perldoc List colon colon Util.
You may get an error saying You need to install the perl hyphen doc package to use this program.
This indicates, you need to install the perl hyphen doc package.
Do so using Synaptic Package Manager.
Please refer to the relevant Linux spoken tutorials on the spoken tutorial website.
What you see here is the documentation for the List colon colon Util module.
Note that the documentation contains-
Hit the 'Q' key to exit the perldoc viewer.
Next, we will see how to use List colon colon Util module in a Perl program.
Let me open a sample program exist underscore modules.pl which I have already saved.
In your exist underscore modules dot pl file, type the following code as displayed on the screen.
use List colon colon Util tells Perl to find and load the module List colon colon Util.
qw() function extracts words out of the string using a delimiter and returns the words as a list.
It is just a quick way of declaring an array.
While importing a module, it imports only the subroutines specified in the list into our program.
It contains general-utility list of subroutines.
The module will export its subroutines and variables into our program.
The most popular subroutines available in List colon colon Util are:
max –this returns the highest numerical value in the list.
maxstr- returns the highest string in the list.
min- this returns the lowest numerical value.
minstr – returns the lowest string in the list.
shuffle – this returns the values of the input in a random order.
sum – returns the numerical sum of all the elements in the list.
There is no need to write separate source code for each function.
We can just make use of these available subroutines in our program.
These are the inputs I am passing to the function max, min, sum and shuffle.
And, these are the print statements.
Switch back to the terminal and type:  perl exist underscore modules dot pl and press Enter.
In Random number, you may get any value between 0 and 51.
Next, we will see how to create a new Perl module and add it to CPAN.
Below are the steps to create a module:
Create a place to develop the module.
Create skeleton files for the module.
Document the module.
Write the Perl code.
Write the code for testing.
Distribute the module in CPAN.
Perl is distributed with a program called h2xs which is used to generate files for a new module.
Math colon colon Simple specifies our module name.
This is used to generate the directory which should clearly identify the module it contains.
Basically, it creates skeleton files for the module. hyphen PAX are options that omit autoload and autogenerate.
Let's create a new module- Math colon colon Simple.
It will be provided with simple functions: add, subtract, multiply and divide.
Let us switch to terminal to execute the h2xs command.
Type: h2xs hyphen PAXn Math colon colon Simple.
The h2xs program generates all these files required to distribute the module.
Let us change directory to Math hyphen Simple.
Note the directory path on your machine. It may be as Math forward slash Simple.
Type "ls" to list all the files in the directory. We can see the following files.
The "Changes" file is where we will keep track of changes, made to our module, when we write new versions.
lib subdirectory contains the module.
MANIFEST contains a list of files in this directory.
Makefile is a Perl program used to create a Unix Makefile.
We will use this Makefile to test and install our module.
Test scripts will be in 't' subdirectory.
The tests are simple Perl scripts, but with a dot t extension used for unit testing.
Simple.pm is our module.
All these files are generated automatically when we execute the h2xs command.
Let us open the simple.pm file.
Change the directory to lib forward slash Math.
Now, we will open the simple.pm file to see the existing content.
Type: gedit Simple.pm.
What we see here is a documented, functional Perl module that doesn't do anything.
We have to write the required functions in this file to make it do something.
Add the below code after the text: "Preloaded methods go here".
Here, we will add four subroutines add, subtract, multiply and divide.
Now, let's create a sample Perl program to test our code that makes sure it is working properly.
Let us open the test file Math-Simple.t under the subdirectory 't'.
Type: gedit Math-Simple.t
Add the following code after the existing code: “Insert your test code below..”.
The Print statements will print the output.
Let us run the test script.
Type: perl Math-simple.t and press Enter.
We see this error message because the Perl script cannot find Simple.pm in its directory.
It should look inside the lib directory. How can we rectify this error?
Let us see a few options for this.
At the rate INC is a special variable that contains a list of directories.
Perl modules and libraries can be loaded from these directories.
This line of code tells the Perl program to add this directory path to its at the rate INC search directory.
Alternately, we can add files to at the rate INC at run time using '-I' option.
Now, let us switch to the terminal.
I will execute the program using the '-I' command line parameter.
So, I will type: perl -Ilib t/Math-Simple.t
Here is the output as expected.
We have tested the module and it is working fine.
Final step is to distribute the module.
The general procedure for installing module is to run these commands.
Installation involves copying files into the Perl library directory.
Most of us don't have permission to copy into this directory.
Since Math-Simple isn't a very useful module, I am not demonstrating the installation part.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Use the Text colon colon Wrap module.
Make use of the Wrap() function which wraps the input text to form neat paragraphs.
Text colon colon Wrap module has a variable- "columns". Set the columns value to 30.
Print the text to see the formatted output.

Then we have our condition:  while $num is less than or equal to (<=) 10, the loop will continue and then we have num ++.
It can also be declared inside these parentheses.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Polymorphismin C++.
Polymorphism Virtual Function.
Let us start with an introduction to polymorphism.
Polymorphism is the ability to take different forms.
It is the mechanism to use a function with same name in different ways.
Let us see virtual functions.
Virtual function is the member function of a class.
It can be overridden in its derived class.
It is declared with virtual keyword.
Virtual function call is resolved at run-time.
Now, let us see an example on virtual functions.
I have already written the code.
Let us go through it.
Note that our file name is virtual.cpp.
In this program,we will calculate the area of a rectangle, parallelogram and triangle.
Then, we have a class Parallelogram.
This is the base class.
In this, we have declared integer variables as width, height and ar.
These are declared protected.
Then we have function set_values(), declared as public.
Here, we have passed two arguments as a  and b.
Then we access the protected members using the public members.
This is our virtual function area().
Here we calculate the area of parallelogram.
Then we have class Rectangle as a derived class.
It inherits the properties of base class Parallelogram.
Here we override the function area().
Then we calculate the area of the rectangle.
And print the value.
Here we have another derived class as triangle.
This also inherits the properties of the base class Parallelogram.
Here again we override the function area().
Then we calculate the area of the triangle
and print the value.
Here we create an objectof class Parallelogram as p.
We can see here pointer parallel.
This is the pointer of class parallelogram.
This is called as Base pointer.
Pointer of base class can point to the object of the derived class.
Here we create objects of class Rectangle and Triangle.
Here, parallel is assigned to the address of p.
Then we pass arguments as 3 and 2.
Then we call the function area().
Here, parallel is assigned to the address of rect.
rect is the object of class Rectangle.
Again we pass arguments as 4 and 5.
And we call the function area().
And, at last we assign parallel to the address of Triangle
trgl.
This is the object of class Triangle.
Here, we pass arguments as 6 and 5
and call function area().
Now,  let us execute the program.
To compile, type: g++ space virtual.cpp space -o space vir press Enter.
Type: ./vir  press Enter.
You can see that the output is displayed as:
Area of parallelogram is 6
Area of rectangle is 20
and Area of triangle is 15.
Come back to  our slides.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt:
Polymorphism
Virtual function, example Virtual int area().
As an assignment:  Calculate the perimeter of rectangle, square and triangle.
Create perimeter as a Virtual function.

And if you read up on Google or any search engine about "MD5 encryption" that's "M D 5". Let's just get rid of this. Let me just write this down for you. It is a very useful way of encrypting data.
Now everything is right. Md5's function in php takes a string or a numerical value, string value or just a data value.
Don't forget that.
Now if you say someone hacked into your database and finds out people's passwords which is typed in as "abc", they will be able to get it easily.
Ok I'll see you in the next part. Bye.  This is _________, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.
Hello and welcome to this tutorial on php sessions.
Sessions are quite similar to cookies.
However, sessions only have a temporary time i.e expiry time.
They will be destroyed as soon as the browser is closed and all the connection to the page is lost.
So, sessions are not like cookies because you can't set a particular expiry time
and they are not stored in the same way.
I mean, the "id" of the session can be stored in the cookie.
Or you might have seen in a browser URL something like this.
I don't remember the name - something equals and a lot of numbers and alphabets as well.
So, basically sessions are very similar to cookies.
However, they are not stored for a long period of time; only until the user closes the browser.
Okay. So sessions are different.
First of all, we need to declare or call this function called 'session_start()'.
Now, this needs to be at the top of every page that you use sessions in.
So, if you don't have this and you are trying to echo out a session value or you're trying to set a session, it won't work.
You need the session start code there.
Now I'll show you the error that comes up when you don't use this, so you'll remember it.
Creating a session is very easy.
Use 'dollar underscore SESSION' and in square brackets give the name of the session.
I will type 'name' and equal this value to something.
It could be a string data or the new written data.
Okay, so our session is set here.
Let's run this for the first time.
So, let's refresh.
Okay, nothing has happened.
I'll comment out this code like I did in my Cookies tutorial.
If you haven't seen that, please do so.
Next I'll echo out the value of the session that I have set.
So that's 'name'.
Please note that this is not going to be executed.
This will be on a completely new page, for all you know.
But here I'm just starting my session.
I'm getting a session called 'name' that has already been stored by our server.
So, let's refresh we can see that is equal to "Alex".
So, you can add this and this code onto any page.
So, you can have your session start and echo your session name onto your page as long as this has been started on any page of the current session of the browser.
So, for example, if I create a new page, add my php code here and say session_start().
And then echo out the session 'name'.
And I'll save this in my 'sessions' folder as new page or 'new dot php'.
So, when we come back to our page here and we click here, we type 'new dot php'.
We get exactly the same value, even though we are not working on the same page that we created our session in, we are still able to access it.
However, if I was to close my browser and reopen it, this session probably would not  exist.
Hope that is clear.  Now let me show you what happens if you don't put the session_start() in.
You get something similar to this.
Let's go back and check it.
What happened here is that we are not getting any output because we haven't started our session.
When we type 'session_start', you can see we get our value as output.
The reason I don't have an output is because I don't have that type of error reporting on.
But if you did have a specific type of error reporting on, I have a tutorial on that as well, then you would probably get an error.
So you can close this now and I'll show you how to 'unset' a session.
There area 2 ways to do this is.
Either unset and then session in brackets to unset our session.
Or use a completely different command altogether and that is session_destroy().
And the difference between these two commands is 'sessions_destroy' will completely destroy sessions that you currently hold
and 'unset' will unset a particular session.
So, it's your choice, you can log the user out and say session_destroy().
That would clear all current session variables that you hold at the present time.
Or otherwise you can just 'unset' a specific one.
So, what are sessions useful for?
If you've come into a website and see a box like Remember me and you don't check this box, then you would probably be using sessions.
Because once the users' browser has been closed, you would be logged out.
And when you come back to the website you'll have to re-type your details like your 'user name' and password to login to the website.
But it's different if you are using cookies because you set an expiry time - which means that your 'username' will be logged in or this cookie will be held until you decide to destroy it.
And we have to create a code to destroy our cookie, like I showed in my 'Cookies' tutorial.
So, really it's your choice whether you use sessions or cookies.
Sessions are good for short term,  Cookies are good for long term - specific amount of time that you want a piece of data to be held.
But if you've gone through my php Project - 'Register and login', you'll see that I use sessions.
This is because I need to use sessions when I'm creating tutorials.
However you can take any form of this.
It could be a cookie, it could be a session, it is really your choice whether you want to keep the user logged in for a long period of time or not.
So, if you've got any questions on this, feel free to contact me.
Make sure you subscribe to phpacademy.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Inserting Images and inbuilt Graphics in a spreadsheet.
Images can be added into a spreadsheet
Let us open our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
This file and images have been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page
Please download and extract the files to a folder on your Desktop
Make its copy and use it for practising
It is a good practice to select a cell and then insert an image.
Alternatively, you can click on the Insert menu in the menu bar.
Either ways the Insert Image dialog box opens.
Now locate the image that you want to insert on your computer.
I have saved some images on my Desktop in a folder named Images.
These images are available in the Code files link below the player, as mentioned earlier.
I will choose Image1 from my computer.
Then click on the Open button at the top right corner.
Observe that the image is displayed in the spreadsheet.
But, the image is covering up some of the data.
When the image is selected, we see handles around it.
Click and drag any of the corner handles to resize the image proportionally.
Now let’s move the image.
Place the cursor on any one of the borders till the cursor turns into a hand.
Click and move the image to the desired location and then release the mouse button.
Now, we can see our data and the image clearly.
When the image is selected, the Formatting toolbar shows options related to image only.
We will learn more about these options later in this tutorial.
To exit the Image edit mode, click anywhere outside the image.
Let us insert another image by hyperlinking it.
For this part of the demonstration, we will work on Sheet 2.
In Sheet 2, we will select cell A2.
Then click on the Insert Image icon in the Standard toolbar.
Insert Image dialog box opens up.
This time I will choose Image2 from my computer.
Locate the image that you want to insert on your computer.
To link the image to the spreadsheet, check the Insert as Link checkbox at the bottom left.
Then click on the Open button at the top right corner.
The Confirm Linked Graphic dialog box appears.
Check the option Ask when linking the graphic if not already checked by default.
Then click on the Keep Link button.
The image is now hyperlinked to this spreadsheet.
When we link an image:
Changes made to the image file are reflected in the linked image in the spreadsheet.
Let's save and close our spreadsheet now.
Go to the folder where all the images are saved.
Rename Image2 as Image2-old  and rename Image3 file as Image2.
Let us open our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file once again.
Notice that Image2 in the spreadsheet has now changed.
However, one major disadvantage of hyperlinking a file is that
Whenever you want to send this spreadsheet to a different computer or user
You will have to send both the spreadsheet as well as the image file.
Which means, you have to keep track of the location where you are saving both the files.
Next, let’s learn another method of inserting images into a spreadsheet.
This is done by dragging and dropping the image from its saved folder location.
Go to the folder where all the images are saved.
Now drag-and-drop Image2-old directly into the spreadsheet wherever you want to place it.
I will place it in this empty space.
The image gets inserted into our spreadsheet.
Let’s undo this change.
Next let us hyperlink the same image using the drag-and-drop method.
Go to the folder where all images are saved.
Hold the Control and Shift keys together and then click on Image2-old.
The image is now hyperlinked to this spreadsheet.
Save and close the spreadsheet now.
Once again go to the folder where all the images are saved.
Now re-open the Personal Finance Tracker.ods file again.
The hyperlinked image is no longer visible in the spreadsheet.
The hyperlinked path shows an error!
So, let’s delete this hyperlink.
To do so, click on the hyperlinked path shown as an error.
Now press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Next we will learn how to insert images from the clipboard.
We can copy images stored on the clipboard, from one spreadsheet to another.
Let's open a new spreadsheet, which will be our target file.
We already have images in Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods.
Now select Image2 from the source file which is to be copied.
Press CTRL and C keys together to copy the image.
The image is now saved on the computer’s clipboard.
Now switch to the target document, which is Untitled 1.
Select the location where you wish to place the saved image in Untitled 1.
Now press CTRL and V keys together to insert the image into the spreadsheet.
The image is inserted into our target file.
Close the Untitled 1 document without saving it.
Next let us explore the other options available in the Picture toolbar.
For this part of the demonstration we will work on Sheet 1.
Now let’s click on Image1.
The Formatting toolbar changes to the Picture toolbar.
Here, we see various tool icons to edit an image.
In that case, click on the double arrow icon at the end of the toolbar to see the hidden icons.
Click on the drop-down of the Filter option.
From the pop-up menu, let’s click on the Charcoal Sketch option.
Next let’s see how to crop this image.
Now click on the Crop image icon in the Picture toolbar.
We see blue colored handles appear around the image.
Click and drag any one of the handles, as shown.
Then click anywhere outside the image to exit from the Image editing mode.
The image gets cropped as per our selection.
There are other options on the Picture toolbar which you can explore on your own later.
Gallery has images as well as sounds which we can insert in our spreadsheet.
Click on the Insert menu in the menu bar.
From the sub-menu go to the Media option and click on Gallery to open it.
Alternately, click on the Gallery icon on the Sidebar which is at extreme right.
We can see various folders which have inbuilt images which we can use.
Select the Finance folder by clicking on it.
Then drag-and-drop the image ATM01 into the spreadsheet.
We see that the image gets inserted into our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
We don’t need the ATM01 image anymore, so we will delete it.
Then close the Gallery section by clicking on the X icon besides Gallery.
Lastly save and close the file.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial, let us summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt to insert an image into a spreadsheet in many different ways like
We have also learnt how to:
As an assignment
Insert an image as a link in Sheet 2 ,  Save and close the file.
Go to the folder where the image is saved. Now rename the image.
Open and check if the image is still visible in the spreadsheet.
Now rename the image back to its original name.
Check if the image is visible in the spreadsheet.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Formatting Data in Calc.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: * Formatting Borders, background colors.
Formatting multiple lines of text using Automatic Wrapping.
Merging Cells, Shrinking text to fit the cell.
Here we are using GNU/Linux  as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
First, let us learn about formatting borders in LibreOffice Calc.
Formatting of borders can be done on a particular cell or a block of cells.
For example, let us format the cells with the headings “Serial Number”, “Item”, “Cost”, “Spent”, ”Received”, ”Date” and ”Account”.
So, let us first click on the cell with the heading Serial Number, denoted by “SN”.
Now, hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.
After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the “Borders” icon on the Formatting toolbar.
A drop down box opens up containing several border styles.
Click on one of the styles you want to apply on the borders.
I will click on the last option.
We see that the borders get formatted according to  our selected style.
Let us undo this change.
The selected cells are still highlighted. Right-click on the selection and choose “Format Cells” option.
Now click on the “Borders” tab.
You will see the options for “Line arrangement”, “Line”, “Spacing to contents” and “Shadow style”.
Displayed in each of these are the default settings of Calc.
But one can change any of these to suit our requirement.
Under “User-defined”, you can see a small preview window which displays the selection.
I will choose the third option under “Default” and you can see that it is reflected in the preview window.
I will also change the “Style”, “Width” and “Color”.
Again, notice the change in the preview window.
Spacing to contents has the “Synchronize” option checked.
This means that the same spacing is applied to all the margins.
One can uncheck it and change the margin spacing as per the requirement.
I will change “Top” and “Bottom” margins to 1.4pt.
I will leave you to explore the various Shadow styles, on your own.
Click on OK.
This will apply the chosen style to the selected cells.
After learning how to format borders, now let us learn how to give background colors to cells.
In order to give background colors to cells, Calc provides an option called “Background Color”, located in the Formatting toolbar.
Now, let us see how it is implemented.
For example, let us give a background color to the cells containing the headings.
So, let us first click on the cell which contains the heading Serial Number, denoted by “SN”.
Now hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.
After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the “Background Color” option in the Formatting toolbar.
A pop-up menu opens up where you can select the color you want to apply as a background color.
Let us click on “Grey” color.
You can see that the cell background for the headings turns grey.
Calc provides various options for formatting multiple lines of text.
The first one is by using “Automatic Wrapping”.
"Automatic Wrapping” allows a user to enter multiple lines of text into a single cell.
So, let us see how it is implemented.
Now, in our “personal finance tracker.ods” sheet, let us click on a empty cell.
For example, let's click on cell number “B12”.
Now, do a right-click on cell and then click on the “Format Cells” option.
Now, click on the “Alignment” tab in the dialog box.
At the bottom of the dialog box, click on the “Wrap text automatically” option and then click on the OK button.
Now, we type “THIS IS A PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER. IT IS VERY USEFUL”.
You see that the multiple statements get wrapped in a single cell.
After learning about “Automatic Wrapping”, we will now learn how to merge cells in Calc.
In our “personal finance tracker.ods” file, if we want to merge cells containing the Serial Number with the heading “SN” and their corresponding items then first click on the data entry '1' under the heading “SN”.
Now, hold down the Shift key on the keyboard and click on the cell with its corresponding item “Salary”.
This highlights the two cells that are to be merged.
Next, click on the Format option in the menu bar and then click on the Merge Cells option.
In the sidebar which pops up, click on the “Merge Cells” option.
In order to move the contents of both the cells in a single cell, click on the Yes option in the dialog box which appears.
You see that the selected cells get merged into one and the contents are also within the same merged cell.
Now let us undo the merging we did by pressing CTRL+Z together.
Next, we will learn how to shrink text to fit into the cell.
The font size of the data in a cell can be automatically adjusted to fit into a cell.
Let's type the text “This is for the month of January” in the cell referenced as B14.
You see that the text doesn't fit into the cell.
In order to shrink the text so that it fits, click on the cell referenced as B14 first.
Now click on the Format option in the menu bar and then click on “Cells”.
Alternately, right-click on the cell and click on “Format Cells”.
You see that the “Format Cells” dialog-box opens.
Click on the “Alignment” tab in the dialog-box.
At the bottom of the dialog box, click on the “Shrink to fit cell size” check-box and then click on the OK button.
You see that the entire text shrinks and adjusts itself by decreasing its font size so that the text fits into the cell referenced as B14.
To summarize, we learned about: * Formatting Borders, background colors in Calc.
Formatting multiple lines of text using 'Automatic Wrapping'.
Merging Cells, Shrinking text to fit the cell.
COMPREHENSIVE ASSIGNMENT-
Open “spreadsheet practice.ods” sheet.
Select all the headings,Give the background color to the headings as blue.
Using “Automatic Wrapping”, type the text: “This is a Department Spreadsheet”.
Shrink this text to fit in the cell.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Relational Operators in Java.
In this tutorial, we will learn about the
boolean data type,Relational operators and
how to compare data using Relational operators.
To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of data types in Java.
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our  website as shown.
Relational operators are used to check for conditions.
Their output is a variable of boolean data type.
A   boolean data type is of size  1 bit.
It stores only two values.
true or false.
true is the output when the condition is true.
false is the output if the condition is not true.
Here is a list of the relational operators available.
greater than
less than equal to
greater than or equal to less than or equal to
not equal to
We shall look into each of them in detail.
Switch to Eclipse.
Here we have the Eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
I have created a class BooleanDemo and added the Main method.
Now let us add some expressions.
Type boolean b ;
The keyword boolean declares the data type of the variable b as boolean.
We shall store the result of our condition in b.
We shall define a variable weight and check for a condition using that variable.
int weight  equal to 45;
We shall check if the value in weight is greater than 40.
b  equal to weight  greater than 40;
This statement says: check if the value of variable is greater than 40 and store the result in 'b'.
Now, let us print the value of 'b'.
System  dot  out dot  println(b);
As we can see, the output is True.
Let us see what happens if the value is less than 40.
Change weight to 30.
Save and run.
We can see that the output is False as expected.
This way, the greater than symbol is used to check if one value is greater than the other.
Similarly, less than symbol is used to check if one value is less than the other.
Let us change the greater than to less than symbol.
So, We are checking if the value of weight is less than 40.
Save, Run.
As we can see, the output is true as expected.
Let us change the value of weight to 45 and see the output.
We see that we get a false because the condition
weight less than 40 is not true.
Now let us see how to check if a value is equal to another.
To do that, we use two equal to symbols.
Change less than symbol to double equal to.
As we can see, the output is false because the value of weight is not equal to 40.
Now let us change the weight to 40 and see the output.
Save and  Run.
As we can see, the output is True.
This way, double equal to is used for checking equality.
Please be careful because, often people use a single equal to symbol for checking equality.
And this gives unnecessary errors.
Next we'll see how to check for less than or equal to.
To do that, we will use a less than symbol followed by an equal to symbol.
Change the double equal to,  to less than equal to.
The output is True as expected.
Now let us change the value of weight to see if the less than check is performed.
Change 40 to 30.
We see, that although the weight is not equal to 40 we get the output as True because it is less than 40.
Let us see what happens if the value of weight is greater than 40.
Let's say 50. Save and Run.
As we can see, the output is False   because the value of weight is not equal to 40.
And it also not less than 40.
Similarly, we use a greater than symbol followed by an equal to symbol for checking greater than or equal to.
Let us try it.
Change less than equal to to greater than equal to.
As we can see, the output is true  because weight is greater than 40.
Let us change weight to a value less than 40. Let's say 30.
We get a false because the value of weight is not greater than 40 and also not equal to 40.
Next, we’ll see how to check for not equal to.
It is done by using an exclamation mark followed by an equal to symbol.
Change greater than to exclamation.
So, this statement says: check if the value of weight is not equal to 40 and store the result in b.
As we can see, the output is true because the values of weight is not equal to 40.
Let us change the weight to 40 and see the output.
Change 30 to 40.
Save, Run.
We get a false because the condition weight not equal to 40 is false.
The not equal to condition can be thought of as opposite of equal to condition.
This is how we use the various relational operators to compare data in Java.
This brings us  to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learnt about: the boolean data type,
the relational operators and
how to use relational operators to compare data.
As an assignment for this tutorial, find out if the two expressions shown are equivalent.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Slide Show creation in LibreOffice Impress.
In this tutorial we will learn about creating:
Slide Transitions and
Automatic Slide Shows
Slide Shows are usually
It can be shown on a desktop, laptop or projector
Slide Shows occupy the entire computer screen
Presentations cannot be edited in the Slide Show mode
Slide Shows are for display purpose only
Let's open our presentation Sample-Impress.odp.
Please download and extract the file
Let’s learn how to view this presentation as a Slide Show.
Locate the ‘Start from First Slide’ icon in the Standard Toolbar.
Notice the tooltip on the icon displays the shortcut key F5 to start the Slide Show.
By clicking on the ‘Start from First Slide’, the presentation is now displayed as a Slide Show.
In Slide Show mode, we can navigate between slides by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
The Right arrow key takes us to the next slide one after the other.
The Left arrow key takes us to the previous slide one before the other.
At any time, to exit the Slide Show, right-click for the context menu.
Then select the End Show option.
Another method to start the Slide Show, is to click on the SlideShow menu in the menu bar.
Another way to exit the Slide Show is by pressing the ESCAPE key on the keyboard.
Next, let’s learn how to use the Mouse Pointer as a pen.
Click on the Slide Show menu in the menu bar and then on the Slide Show Settings option.
The Slide Show Settings dialog box appears.
Under Options, check the boxes for Mouse Pointer visible and Mouse Pointer as Pen.
Click OK to close the dialog box.
Now start the Slide Show by pressing the F5 key.
Notice that the Mouse Pointer now turned into a pen.
This option allows us to mark or draw on the presentation while in the Slide Show mode.
Let’s draw a tick mark before the title ‘Benefit of Open Source’ in slide 1.
Press the left mouse button and drag on the slide, to do so.
We can also advance to the next slide by pressing the Spacebar or Enter key on the keyboard.
Let’s exit the Slide Show by pressing the ESCAPE key.
We can start the Slide Show from the current slide displayed in the Workspace, as well.
To do this, click on the ‘Start from Current Slide’ icon in the Standard Toolbar.
Alternatively, you can do this by clicking on the SlideShow menu in the menu bar.
Notice that this time, the Slide Show started from the slide titled Table of Contents.
Let’s exit the Slide Show.
Open “Practice-Impress.odp” file
Use the Mouse pointer as a pen to draw a small diagram on any slide
Transitions are effects that are applied to slides as we move or
Transition from one slide to the next in a presentation
Click on the Slide Sorter tab in the Workspace.
Let’s learn how to add different transitions to each slide, in one go.
Go to the Sidebar and click on the icon named Slide Transition.
In the Slide Transition section, we can see a list of transition effects available for use.
Notice that the preview of the selected transition effect is displayed in the Workspace.
This is because the Automatic Preview checkbox is selected by default in the section.
We can also modify the selected transition effect through the Modify Transitions subsection.
By default, the Variant field is set to Bottom to top.
This means the transition starts from the bottom and moves to the top as it progresses.
By clicking on the drop-down, we can choose any other variant of your choice.
Now, let’s set a sound to this transition.
Now, let’s select the second slide.
Go to the Slide Transition section and click on the ‘Wheel’ transition.
Under the Modify Transitions subsection, click on the Variant drop-down.
Scroll and select ‘Clockwise 8 Spokes’.
Next, click on the Sound drop-down and select ‘apert’.
Again we see the preview of the transition effect we have made.
Under the Modify Transitions subsection, check the ‘Loop until next sound’.
Now, under the Advance Slide subsection, click on the radio button ‘Automatically after.
Here notice that the time is set as 1 sec.
Lastly, click on the ‘Apply Transitions to all slides’ button.
Clicking on this button applies the same transition for all the slides.
Let’s start the Slide Show now to see all of these customised effects.
Notice that the slides advance automatically with a time interval of 1 second.
Let’s exit the Slide Show.
Now we’ll learn to create presentations
That advance automatically but with different display times for each slides
This is useful when the content of some slides in the presentation are longer
From the Workspace, let’s select the second slide.
Under the Slide Transitions section, go to the Advance Slide subsection.
In the Automatically after field, set the time to ‘2’ seconds.
Let’s select the third slide and set the time to ‘3’ seconds.
Let’s select the fourth slide and set the time to ‘4’ seconds.
Let’s start the Slide Show.
Notice that each slide is displayed for different lengths of time that we specified.
Let’s exit the Slide Show.
Let’s return to that Normal tab and close the Slide Transition section.
Let us save all these changes for future use and then close the presentation file.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about;
Slide shows,   Slide Transitions,  Automatic Slide Shows with fixed time interval, Automatic Slide Shows with different time intervals
As an assignment:  Open “Practice-Impress.odp” file
Add Slide Transitions - “Wheel” to slide 2 ,  “Shape” to slide 3,  With a “gong” sound
Create an automatic slideshow

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Data types and Factors.
Find types of vectors
Identify categorical variables
Use factor and levels function
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Data frames in R
How to set working directory in Rstudio
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on,
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A data frame CaptaincyData.csv and
A script file myFactor.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to DataTypes folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set this folder as my Working Directory.
In R programming language, Variables are not declared as some data type
Variables are assigned with R-Objects.
The data type of the R-Object becomes the data type of the variable.
It means, everything in R is an object.
The frequently used R-Objects are:
Vectors
Matrices
Factors
and Data Frames
The simplest of these objects is the vector object.
R language has the following atomic vector types:
Logical
Integer
Numeric
Complex
and Character
By atomic, we mean that, vector holds the data of a single data type.
Now, we will learn how to declare these vector types.
Let us switch to RStudio.
On the Console window, type test Data with capital D.
Press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Now type TRUE in capitals.
Now, type class and then testData in parentheses.
Observe that the data type shown here is logical.
Now, type testData
Press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Type, within double quotes TRUE in capitals.
Now, type class and then testData in parentheses.
Press Enter at the end of every command.
Observe that the data type shown here is character.
Note that, R considers TRUE as logical data and TRUE within double quotes as character data.
Now, we will learn about numeric data type.
For this, we will assign a value of 12 to our testData.
We will modify the previous command.
Click in the Console window and press the up arrow key twice.
The command with testData appears.
Delete the word TRUE in capitals.
Now, type 12 and press Enter.
Type class  and then testData in parentheses.
The data type shown here is numeric.
Now, we will assign a value of 12.5 to our testData.
In the Console window, press the up arrow key.
Locate the command with testData
and assign 12 point 5 to this variable.
Now, type class and then testData in parentheses.
The data type is shown again as numeric.
Here, R considers both 12 and 12.5 as numeric.
In order to declare an integer variable in R, we will invoke the as dot integer function.
In the Console window, type testData
Press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Now, type as dot integer and in parentheses 12.
Now, type class and then testData in parentheses.
The data type is shown as integer.
We can also declare an integer by appending an L suffix.
On the Console window, type the following commands.
Again, the data type shown is integer.
To know more about the vector types, please refer to the Additional material section on this website.
Open the script myFactor.R.
I am resizing the Source window.
Run this script by clicking on Source button.
I am resizing the Source window.
captaincy opens in the Source window.
Let us find the data type for the data in each column of captaincy, using str function.
Click on the script myFactor.R
In the Source window, type str and within parentheses captaincy.
Save the script and run the current line by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
I am resizing the Console window.
On the Console, the details of captaincy are shown.
There are 6 observations of 9 variables.
The structure of names in the captaincy is denoted as Factor.
In R language, Factors are data objects.
They are used to categorize the data and store it as levels.
Factors are variables, which take on a limited number of different values.
They are often referred to as categorical variables.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
Click on captaincy data frame.
I am resizing the Source window.
We will look at the data in names column of captaincy.
Click on the script myFactor.R
In the Source window, type print  within parentheses, captaincy dollar sign names.
Here dollar sign is used to extract elements by name.
Run the current line.
The names of the captains are shown in the Console window.
Also, the levels are shown.
Levels are distinct values in a Factor.
R language considers names as  a Factor.
Click on captaincy data frame.
names should be of character data type.
We will change its type from Factor to character.
Click on the script myFactor.R
In the Source window, type captaincy dollar sign names
Press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Now, type as dot character within parentheses, captaincy dollar sign names.
Now, we will check the variable type of names again.
In the Source window, type str and captaincy in parentheses.
Run the last two lines.
I am resizing the Source window.
Now, the type of names is changed to character.
Let us learn how to identify a categorical variable.
Click on captaincy data frame.
I am resizing the Console window.
formats represents the number of cricket formats played by a captain.
There are three formats of cricket played at the international level:
Test matches,
One-Day Internationals
and Twenty20 Internationals.
Accordingly, formats can take one of three distinct values:
1, 2 or 3.
Observe that formats in captaincy should be a categorical variable.
At this instant, the variable type of formats is set as integer.
Now, we will change the type of formats from integer to Factor.
Click on the script myFactor.R
In the Source window, type captaincy dollar sign formats
Press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Type factor within parentheses, captaincy dollar sign formats.
factor function is used to create a factor.
Now, type str and in parentheses captaincy.
Run the last two lines.
formats is shown as Factor with 3 different levels 1, 2 and 3.
These levels are of character type.
So, a factor’s levels are always character values.
We can also check the levels of a factor variable using levels function.
In the Source window, type levels, within parentheses captaincy dollar sign formats.
Run the current line.
The levels of formats are shown as 1 2 3.
We can also change the values of levels using levels function.
Let us change the levels of formats from 1, 2, 3 in digits, to One, Two, Three in words
In the Source window, type the following command.
Now, type print, within parentheses captaincy dollar sign formats.
Save the script and run the last two lines.
The values and levels of formats have been changed.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to: Find types of vectors
Identify categorical variables
Use factor and levels function
We now suggest an assignment.
Using built-in dataset iris, find out the categorical variables.
Can you find a variable which is categorical, but R reads as numeric?
If yes, change it to categorical.
Please contact us.
Please post your general queries in this forum.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Reflection and Refraction.
In this tutorial, we will learn to,
Calculate the angles of reflection and refraction.
Change the medium and angle of incidence to verify Snell's Law.
Calculate the value of critical angle.
Verify Huygens' principle.
Here I am using,
Firefox web browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For pre-requisites tutorials please visit this site.
Use the given link to download the Apps.
I have already downloaded the Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial, we will use,
Right-click on refraction_en.htm file.
Select the option Open With Firefox web Browser.
Reflection and Refraction of Light App opens in the browser.
The App shows reflection and refraction of light through a given medium.
The default media are air and water.
Note that the medium with lesser refractive index is shown in white background.
The medium with greater refractive index is shown in blue background.
Light from the top left corner, strikes the boundary surface of the two media.
It shows reflection and refraction.
Reflection is shown by the blue coloured angle.
Observe that the angle of incidence and reflection are the same.
Here we see the refraction of light.
When light travels from rarer medium to denser medium, it bends towards normal.
On the green panel we have a choice to change a few parameters.
Let us reverse the two media using the drop downs.
Select water as the upper medium.
Select air as the lower medium.
Here the ray of light travels from denser to rarer medium.
The ray bends away from the normal.
Note that both the drop downs show the same material media.
Below the drop down, we see two text fields.
Here we can also change the values manually between the range of 1 to 5.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to refresh the App.
Next Angle of incidence can be changed from 0.1 degrees to 90 degrees.
Press F5 key to see the default value.
Below the text fields App shows the Angle of reflection and refraction.
Graph shows the angle of refraction with angle of incidence.
We can also change the angle of incidence by dragging this red coloured ray.
Notice the change in angle of reflection and refraction.
Simultaneously observe the graph.
Now from the graph we will learn the two cases of Snell’s law.
Before that let us state Snell’s law of refraction.
Ratio of sine of angle of incidence to sine of angle of refraction is a constant.
n
Here are the 2 cases of Snell’s law.
If n
If n
Change the Angle of incidence to 20 degrees.
Observe that the angle of refraction has changed to 14.9.
This graph shows the first case of Snell’s law.
Here angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction.
Observe that the light ray bends towards the normal.
Let us see what happens, when incident ray passes from denser to rarer medium.
From the first drop down change the material medium to diamond.
Notice that the light ray has bent away from the normal.
This graph shows the second case of Snell’s law.
Here the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence.
Increase the Angle of incidence to 30 degrees.
The refracted ray has bent still more further away from the normal.
Again increase the angle of incidence to 35 degrees.
In this case observe that the refraction is not possible.
Here the incident ray is totally reflected.
This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection.
Here the critical angle is formed.
The critical angle for diamond and water is 33.3 degrees.
Now we will calculate the critical angle using the formula.
Let us make a tabular column to calculate critical angle for two different media.
Here I have calculated the critical angle for diamond and water.
The calculated value is comparable to the value shown in the App.
Now enter these values in the table.
Next change the upper medium to water and lower medium to air.
Note the refractive indices for both the media.
Then calculate the critical angle using the above formula.
Observe that the values are comparable.
Note these values in the table.
As an assignment
Calculate the critical angle for the two media.
Now we will move on to the next App.
Right click on refractionhuygens_en.htm file.
Open With Firefox Web Browser.
The App opens in the browser.
App shows Reflection and Refraction of light waves using Huygen's principle.
Click on the Restart button.
Here the plane wavefront is incident diagonally on the boundary of the media.
Click on the Next step button.
Explanation of each step is provided in this text box.
Note the change in media, when the wavefront is incident on the boundary.
Click on the Pause button.
Observe the pink points on the boundary between the media.
Each pink point is the source of spherical wavefront.
These generating waves in the Medium 1 and Medium 2 are the wavelets.
Click on the Resume button.
Note that the waves in Medium 2 move with less velocity as compared to Medium 1.
This is because, the medium 2 has higher refractive index.
Click on the Next step button.
Click on the Pause button.
Observe the tangent drawn to all these spherical waves.
This line, here is the source of the secondary wavefront.
So, the points on every wavelet results in the formation of secondary wavefront.
Here the values of Angle of incidence, reflection and refraction are given.
Click on the Resume button.
Direction of propagation changes when waves move from medium 1 to medium 2.
Again click on the Next step button.
Here the direction of the propagation of waves is shown.
Click on the Pause button.
Observe that these lines of propagation are perpendicular to the wavefronts.
Click on the Resume button.
Change the Angle of incidence to 60 degrees.
Click on the Next step button.
Here we can see a series of wavefronts that are incident on the boundary surface.
Observe the speed and wavelength of wavefronts in both the media.
The wavelength and speed of the wavefront decreases in the denser medium.
But the frequency of the plane wavefronts remains the same.
Let us reverse the refractive indices and observe the formation of wavefronts.
Here the speed of the wavefront decreases, as it moves from denser medium.
This shows the total internal reflection.
Here the incident wavefront is completely reflected and not refracted.
As an assignment
Observe the formation of wavefront and give an explanation.
Let us summarize
Using these Apps, we have Simulated reflection and refraction of a light ray.
Calculated the angles of reflection and refraction.
Changed the medium and angle of incidence to verify Snell's Law.
Calculated the value of critical angle.
These Apps were created by Walter-fendt and his team.

With less clutter, we can use these discussion as instructional material
This is Madhuri Ganapathi from, IIT Bombay signing off.
This is the 3rd part of my Change password tutorial. In this part, we’re going to change the password in the database.
We’ve already connected to our database up here.
We’re already connected here, so there’s no need to reconnect since that command has already been reissued.
I’ll create a new query called “$query change” and that will be equal to “mysql_ query()" function.
Now, this is a new bit of code.  So, I will scroll down so that you can see it easily.
This is “UPDATE”.  So I’m going to say UPDATE users - which, you can see is our table - so to update our "users" table.
I will say SET password equal to '$new password'
making sure I use inverted commas here.
Then I’ll say WHERE username is equal to the '$user' variable that I’ve got on my page currently.
Now this equates
to what we have in this column here.
So, since we’ve already processed our php session,
that is equal to "Alex".
This piece of code is basically  saying  “update the table, change the password to the new password entered by the user. – This is the password they want
and change this “WHERE” to Alex,
as this is equal to Alex.
So, this password will be changed because this "username" is equal to "Alex".
So, this starts with 900 and as soon as we change it, we can refresh this and check that it actually has been changed.
So I’ll just add a few more things.
Let’s just put this back, up here.
And I’ll kill the page and say die() and then say “Your password has been changed”.
Then I’ll put a link in saying “Return” and that’s going to return to the main page.
And that is “index.php”.
Before we kill the page, I’m going to destroy the session.
So, “session_destroy()”.
The reason being, once the users have changed their password, this link will take them back to the main page and this will destroy the session.
So, they’ll need to login again using the new password.
So, if we test this, remember in here, my current password is "abc" whose 'md5 hash' starts with 900.
And if I go back here, write my old password- "abc", my new password "123" and click Change password, we see that all the validation has been checked, our password has been changed and we get this message to return back to the main page.
Now if I try to go back to the member page, you will see that you must be logged in. Our session has been destroyed as we used our “session destroy()” function here.
And also, when I login again and type "abc" as my password which is my old password, we get an “Incorrect password” message.
If I try "123", "you’re in!" and evidence of this is shown in here.
Let’s just go back and click Browse.  Let's scroll down and we can see that the password has been changed from 900 to 202.
Therefore this is a completely new hash and a completely new password.
So everything’s working fine. You can see that it is quite simple to do this.
All you need to do is learn your "sql" queries properly.  I have tutorials on that too.
And you need to think logically about how to check your old password, and your two new passwords.
Obviously, when we did our registration, we had a limit for how big the password should be.
I’ll leave that to you to enter another check to see if the password should be bigger than 6 characters or no bigger than 25 characters.
So, really, there are a lot of checks you can do, but this is the basic skeleton for changing the password in php using a MySQL database.
Hope you enjoyed this. If you have any comments or questions please let me know. Also subscribe to video updates.
Thanks for watching! This is Harini, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.
Over here, it is getting kind of messy but hopefully you can see what's going on.

Welcome to the 3rd part of the User Registration tutorial.
In this part, we are going to check for existence of all that was discussed in the last part.
Here, we are going to start our registration process.
I'll be checking the existence of all these.
Now,  this is using the date() function.
Okay, so if '$submit' then we need to check for existence.
I will add a comment here "check for existence".
Now, this is really easy.
I will go back to my "Register" page.
We got it here.  Let's click in register.
We will not repeat our password.
Register. Oh! repeat password....
'$repeat password'.
An encrypted string of text.
So, I will say- if the string length of '$username' is bigger or greater than 25.... OR
string length of the '$fullname' is greater than 25.
Let me put this correctly.
saying "username" or... no...
"If string length of my password is greater than 25.. or.. string length...
Okay?
Now, to check the character length of "username" and "fullname".
So, "check character  length of username and fullname".
So, just to keep it simple and then otherwise we will say
"check password length".
This will work for sure.
So, otherwise we will say "register the user".
Our code to register the user will go here.
So join me in the next part. Bye-bye.  This is Mad Madhur, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.
Now we will see how to define a matrix.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on understanding menus in Joomla.
For this tutorial, we will be using:
To follow this tutorial, you should know how to create articles in Joomla.
If not, check the relevant Joomla tutorials on the Spoken Tutorial website.
Let’s go to our Digital India webpage to understand more about menus.
On the right of the Homepage, there is a box which says "Main Menu".
It currently has only one menu, "Home". By default, this is the only menu available in Joomla.
Menus are a way to help us navigate the website. Every menu has a set of menu items.
Here "Home" is a menu item which points to all Featured articles.
This is the reason why any article that is marked as "Featured" appears on our Homepage.
Every menu item defines a URL to a webpage.
A menu item can be set to point to an article, like Vitamin A here.
Or it can be set to list all articles under a category, like Vitamins.
Let’s switch to the Joomla control panel.
Click on Menu Manager in the left menu.
Alternately, you may click on Menus in the menu-bar at the top of the webpage and then on Menu Manager.
By default, we have one menu called Main Menu.
Click on the title Main Menu.
We can see the menu items associated with this menu.
Notice that Menu Manager: Menu Items has a similar layout as Article Manager.
Let’s create a menu item which will point to our article "Benefits of Nutrients".
Click on the New button in the toolbar.
Menu Item Type field decides the type of page to be shown, when we click on that menu item.
There are various options like Single Article, List of articles in a category etc.
Click on Select button, next to the Menu Item Type.
A new window opens. Click on Articles in the new window.
We can see a list of options under Articles.
Click on Single Article.
Depending on the Menu Item Type, some new parameters may be required.
Since we have selected Single Article, a new field Select Article has appeared.
This is a mandatory field. Click on Select button, next to this field.
A new window opens with a complete list of articles.
This window has a Search text box which works on the title of the article.
It also has filters to narrow down the list of articles visible in the window.
Let’s select the article Benefits of Nutrients.
For now, we will keep the default settings in all the other fields in this window.
Right on the top, we have the Menu Title field. This is a mandatory field.
Let us type: Single Article - Nutrients as the title.
Click on Save and Close.
Switch to Digital India web-page and refresh it.
Notice the new menu item link. Click on it.
We can see the article Benefits of Nutrients is displayed here.
Click on Digital India at the top left to go back to the Homepage.
Switch to the Menu Manager webpage.
Let's change the Single Article-Nutrients menu item to List of categories.
So, click on the title Single Article-Nutrients.
Click on the Select, next to Menu Item Type.
In the new pop-up window, click on Articles and then on List All Categories.
We are back to the Menu manager window.
Notice now that a new field appears. It requires us to select the Top Level Category.
This is the category whose subcategories will be listed under this menu item.
By default, it is Root.
We will leave all the other fields as they are.
But we will change the menu title to Multiple Categories.
Click on Save and Close.
Switch to the Digital India web-page and refresh it.
In the Main Menu, click on Multiple Categories.
Notice that two of our categories Nutrients and Food Sources are shown on the top left of the webpage.
The numbers next to the category indicate the number of articles under that category.
Also, notice that the category Uncategorized is not shown here.
That is because it has neither any article nor any subcategory assigned to it.
Click on Nutrients link.
The article Benefits of Nutrients and subcategories Vitamins and Minerals are shown up.
Click on Digital India link at the top left to go back to the Homepage.
A menu item can have sub-menus, similar to how a category can have sub-categories.
Switch to the Menu Manager webpage.
Let's create a submenu under Multiple Categories.
On the Menu Items page, click on New button.
Click the Select button next to Menu Item Type and then on Articles.
Select Category List.
This will display a list of articles in a category.
A new field Choose a Category appears.
By default, the selected category is Uncategorised.
Let's select Nutrients in the drop-down list.
On the right, there is a field to select the parent item. Click on it. Then select the option Multiple Categories.
Lastly, let's give this menu a title - we will call it Nutrient Articles.
Let’s have a look at all the changes on the Digital India web-page.
Let’s refresh the webpage and click on Multiple categories menu item.
Immediately, we see the sub-menu item Nutrient Articles displayed below it. Click on it.
This page lists all the articles under this category in a tabular format.
The sub-categories-Vitamins and Minerals are listed separately.
Now, let’s have a look at the title that is displayed for this web-page.
It says Nutrient Articles, as you can see here.
How can we change this title to a different one?
We can do this through the Menu settings.
Switch to the Menu Manager webpage.
Let’s click on the tab Page Display.
Note that here all the page settings are optional.
In Browser Page Title field, type Nutrient Category.
Then click on Save and Close button.
Switch to the Digital India webpage and refresh it.
Notice the browser title now.
It says Nutrient Category.
Click on the Digital India link to go back to the Homepage.
Let us switch back to the Menu Manager.
Notice the Home button in the top toolbar.
This makes the page associated with the selected menu as the website Homepage.
By default, the menu item Home is set as the default Homepage.
We can verify this by hovering the cursor on the Home column button.
The tool tip says “Default”.
Let's make the Nutrient Articles submenu as the default Homepage.
Click on the check-box to the left of the title and click on Home button in the toolbar.
Notice that the yellow star now appears next to this submenu.
Switch to the Digital India webpage and refresh it.
Notice that the Homepage has changed.
Menus are important in Joomla because content can be displayed only via menus and every website must have at least one published menu.
Switch to Menu Manager webpage.
Select the check-box to the left of Nutrient Articles submenu.
Click on the Unpublish button on the top toolbar.
The system shows an error Can't unpublish default home.
This means that the menu associated with the Homepage cannot be unpublished.
However, we can unpublish the parent menu.
Click on the check-box to the left of Multiple Categories.
Click on Unpublish button in the toolbar.
Unpublishing a menu also un-publishes all its submenus.
Let's go to the Digital India webpage and check what we have done. Refresh the Homepage.
Notice that the Homepage now shows an error The requested page cannot be found.
This is because the default Home menu - Nutrient Articles also got unpublished.
Let's go back to the Menu Manager.
Publish the  Multiple Categories by clicking on the Status icon.
Switch to the Digital India web-page and refresh it.
Note that the error on the Homepage has now gone. We can see the Nutrient Articles being displayed.
Here are 2 assignments for you:
Hint is, to use the guidelines given in the assignment-text file provided with this tutorial.
Refresh the Homepage.
Delete the menu item Nutrient Articles. See if you can restore it back.

Welcome to this tutorial on Script console and script commands in Jmol Application.
About script commands
How to use script console window
Change display of the model by using script commands
Display lines of text on the panel.
To follow this tutorial,
you should know how to,create and edit molecular models in Jmol Application.
If not, watch the relevant tutorials available on our website.
Java version 7.
Display on Jmol panel can be modified using:
Options in Menu bar
Options in the Pop-up-menu or
by Scripting commands on the script console.
We had learnt to modify display using menu bar and pop-up-menu in earlier tutorials.
In this tutorial, we will learn to use script commands.
A set of commands is called a script command.
Script commands control the display of a model on panel.
Jmol uses a command language, based on RasMol program.
Writing such commands is called scripting.
Documentation of Jmol's scripting language and list of commands is available at this link:
Now, how to use script commands?
Script commands are typed on the “Script console” window.
Script console is the command line interface of Jmol.
It is available on the menu bar, under File and Console option.
This is Jmol Application window with a model of propane on screen.
Let us now learn to use Script console to change the display.
To open a Script console window, click on File menu in the menu bar.
In the drop-down, scroll down and click on Console.
Jmol script console window opens on the screen.
Script console window has a text area to type the commands.
At the bottom of the window, there is a button to open the Script editor window.
Other buttons, namely, Variables, Clear, History and State are also present on this window.
Click on the Help button to open a page showing a list of available script commands.
Click on OK button to close this window.
Let us now try to write a few simple script commands.
How to write these commands?
Type the command after the $ (dollar)prompt, on the Script console window.
Script commands start with a command word,
continues with a set of parameters separated by spaces
and is terminated by the end of line character or semicolon.
The command line will appear red, until you have completed typing the command.
Press Enter key on the keyboard to activate the command.
I am using Kmag screen magnifier to magnify the console.
For example, to change the color of all the carbons in propane to orange- place the cursor on the Script Console window.
At the dollar prompt, type:  select carbon semicolon color atoms orange
Press Enter key on the keyboard.
The Propane model on the panel, now, has all the carbons in orange color.
Now, to change the color of all bonds to blue-
At the dollar prompt, type:
select all bonds semicolon color bonds blue
Observe that all the bonds in the propane model are now blue in colour.
Next, let us change the size of bonds.
At the dollar prompt, type: wireframe 0.05
The decimal number is used to specify the radius of the bonds, in angstroms. Press Enter.
Note the change in the size of the bonds, in the Propane model.
Similarly, to increase the size of the bonds, at the prompt, type: wireframe 0.1
Once again, note the change in the size of the bonds.
To change the size of the atoms, we will use the command spacefill followed by a decimal number.
At the dollar prompt, type: spacefill 0.2.
The decimal number represents the radius of the atom in angstroms.
Observe the size of the atoms in the propane molecule decrease in size.
Similarly, to increase the size of the atoms, type:
spacefill 0.5
You can see the change in size of the atoms.
Alternately, we can also use command cpk followed by percentage or decimal number.
The percentage represents the vanderwaals radius of the atom.
For example, type: cpk 20% and press Enter.
Note the change in the size of the atoms.
It is possible to write commands, to display lines of text on the Jmol panel.
The command line for the text starts with 'set echo'.
It is followed by the position of the text on the screen.
For example, we will display the name of the molecule as 'Propane' at the top center of the panel.
So, type: set echo top center semicolon echo Propane
We can see the text "Propane", displayed at the  top center of the panel.
We can also display other lines of text on the panel.
For example, I want some text in the bottom left corner of the panel.
At the dollar prompt,
type: set echo bottom left semicolon echo This is a model of Propane.
We can see the text line at the bottom left corner of the panel.
It is also possible to change the color, size and font of the displayed text.
For example, I want the text to be in Arial Italic font.
At the dollar prompt ($), type: font echo 20 Arial italic
Press Enter,This will convert the text to 'Arial Italic' font.
To change the color of the text, we will use color echo followed by name of the colour.
So, type: "color echo yellow" and press Enter.
Note the change in font colour.
Likewise, you can explore many more commands and observe the changes.
Let's Summarize:
In this tutorial, we have learned about:
Script Commands and
Script Console,We also learned to:
Change the display properties of the model by using script commands and
Display lines of text on the panel.
Create a model of 3-methyl-pentane.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of Working with Objects in LibreOffice Draw.
Cut, copy, paste objects
Re-size objects dynamically using handles
Arrange Objects
Group and ungroup objects
Edit individual objects in a group
Move objects within a group.
Let us open the “WaterCycle” file which we had saved on the Desktop.
Now, let’s copy and paste three more clouds to this picture.
First, select the cloud. Then right-click to view the  context menu and click Copy.
Then, place the cursor on the page, right-click for the context menu again and click Paste.
But we can see only one cloud!
Where is the cloud that we copied and pasted?
The copied cloud has been pasted on the top of the original cloud!
Let us select the cloud and move it to the left.
Let us create one more cloud in the same manner.
Select the cloud, right-click for the context menu and click Copy.
Right-click again for the context menu and click Paste.
Now, select the copied cloud and move it to the left.
We can also use short-cut keys to make copies of objects-
Ctrl+C to copy an object
Ctrl+V to paste an object
Ctrl+X to cut an object.
Select the cloud and press the Ctrl and 'C' keys together.
The cloud has been copied.
To paste, press Ctrl and 'V' keys together.
Now, select the cloud and move it to the desired location.
Add two pages to your draw file.
Draw two objects on page one.
Copy an object from page one to page two.
Check where the copied object is placed.
Cut an object and paste it. You can use the short-cut keys for this purpose.
Check if a copy of the object is made when you cut it.
Let us reduce the size of this cloud.
So, first select it.
Now the handles are visible.
Next, place the cursor on one of the corner handles till arrowhead is visible.
Now, hold the left mouse button and drag the arrow inward to make the cloud smaller.
To enlarge it, drag the arrow outward.
To  make this arrow longer, first select it.
Now, move the cursor over one of the handles.
A small transparent arrow with a square beneath appears at the cursor tip.
Now, press the Shift key on the keyboard, hold the left mouse button and using the arrow’s handle, drag it down.
It is much easier to re-size the object if you press the Shift key also, isn’t it?
Resizing using the handles of an object is called Dynamic Resizing.
This means, we do not use exact measurements.
We will learn to exactly re-size objects in later tutorials.
In a similar manner, let’s increase the width of this rectangle.
Select the rectangle, press the Shift key on the keyboard and drag it upward.
Look at the Status bar, at the bottom of the Draw window.
Note that when we resize the rectangle again, the dimensions change.
The Status bar shows the change in position and dimension of the object.
Now let’s arrange the clouds and the sun as shown here.
To identify the clouds, let’s number them- 1, 2, 3, 4, starting from the left to right.
To insert the numbers- let’s select this cloud, double-click and type '1'.
Similarly, let's number the other clouds too.
Now, let’s select cloud 4 and place it over the  sun.
To send it behind the sun,  right-click on the cloud for the context menu.
Click Arrange and select Send Backward.
Cloud 4 is now behind the sun.
Send Backward sends an object one layer behind the present one.
Now, let’s select cloud 3 and place it above the sun.
Right-click for the context menu, click Arrange and select Send to Back.
Cloud 3 is now behind both the sun and cloud 4.
Send to Back sends an object to the last layer.
It now becomes simple to arrange the clouds as shown in the slide.
Let’s select cloud 4, right-click for context menu, click Arrange and select Bring to Front.
Bring to Front brings an object to the first layer.
Then select cloud 3, right-click for context menu, click Arrange and select Bring Forward.
Bring Forward brings an object one layer ahead.
Now, select cloud 2 and place it on cloud 1.
The clouds are arranged as shown in the slide.
Next, let’s delete the numbers from the clouds.
To do so, select the cloud and double-click. Then select the number and press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Pause the tutorial here for this assignment.
Draw a circle, a square and a star and place them as shown below.
Select each object and apply each option from the Arrange menu.
Check how the placement of  figures change for each option.
Now, place the object as shown on this slides and check the Bring to Front  and Sent to Back options.
Next, let’s add trees- like the ones shown in this slide, to the 'Water Cycle' diagram.
We shall draw a tree using the block arrow and an explosion.
Let us add a new page to this Draw file by clicking on Insert and then on Slide.
This will add a new page to our file.
To draw the trunk of the tree, from the Drawing toolbar, select Block Arrows.
Click on the small black triangle to see the available shapes and select Split Arrow.
Place the cursor on the page, hold the left mouse button and drag downwards and sideways.
You have drawn a tree trunk with two branches!
Let us add leaves to the branch.
Select Stars from the Drawing toolbar.
Then, click on the small black triangle and select Explosion.
Now, move to the draw page, place the cursor on the left branch of the arrow, hold the left mouse button and drag left to draw the shape.
So, we have added leaves to the tree!
We shall copy this shape to the right branch of the tree also.
Select the shape.
On the keyboard, press the Ctrl+C keys to copy.
Then, press Ctrl+V keys to paste.
Now move the shape to the right branch of the tree.
We have drawn a tree!
Let us select the tree and move it down.
Only the tree trunk moves down; the leaves don’t!
Here, the tree trunk and the two leaves are treated as separate objects.
Let’s move the tree trunk back to where it was.
Let us learn how to group the tree trunk and two leaves into a single unit.
Any change made to a group is applied to all the objects within the group.
First, click on the page so that none of the objects are selected.
Then, from the Drawing toolbar, click Select.
Move the cursor to the page and click on the page.
Now, press the left mouse button and drag so that all the objects are selected.
You will see a dotted rectangle.
Ensure all the objects of  the tree are selected within this rectangle.
Alternately, you can select two or more objects by pressing the Shift key and then clicking on each object.
Right-click for context menu and select Group.
Now, click on any object in the tree.
The handles appear as if they are part of a single object.
These objects are now treated as a single unit.
To ungroup them as separate objects, select the tree, right-click and select Ungroup.
The objects are now ungrouped and are treated as three separate objects.
Let’s group them again.
Press the Shift key and select the object one after another.
Right-click and select Group.
Let's copy the tree to page one which is our main drawing page.
So, Ctrl and C to copy,  click on page one and Ctrl and 'V' to paste.
Now, suppose we want to edit a single object within a group. What do we do?
Let me demonstrate a simple way to do this without having to ungroup and regroup the objects.
Select the group and right-click for the context menu.
Select Enter Group.
Notice that all the objects outside the group are disabled.
Only the objects within the group can be edited.
For example, let us select the leaves on the right-side of the tree and reduce the size.
Let us press Ctrl + 'Z' to undo this and proceed further.
Now, we should reduce the size of  the tree so that it fits in the 'Water Cycle' drawing.
So, we have to exit the Edit mode of the group.
To exit the group, place the cursor on the page, right-click and select Exit group.
We are now out of the Edit mode for the group.
Select the tree and move the cursor over the bottom-right handle.
The cursor turns into a re-sizing arrow.
Drag the arrow inwards.
And we have reduced the size of the whole tree!
Let's add three more trees to this picture.
Select the tree and Ctrl and 'C' to copy, Ctrl and 'V' three times to paste.
This will create three copies of the trees.
Now, we will move them to the desired location.
Repeat these steps for all the trees.
Now remember, each tree is made up of three objects.
Each tree is also a group by itself.
We have created groups of objects.
Let us now add the water body to the drawing.
To give the effect of water, we shall add a triangle next to the rectangle and then add a curve.
To draw a triangle, select Basic shapes from the Drawing toolbar.
Click on the small black triangle and select Right Triangle.
Let us draw it and place it next to the rectangle.
Now, let us draw a curve filled with color to show the movement of water.
From the Drawing toolbar, select Curve. Now, click on Freeform Line, Filled.
Then place the cursor on top of the triangle, hold the left mouse button and drag it down.
Let’s adjust the curve so that it looks like flowing water.
The triangle and the curve together create water; let’s group them as a single object.
From the Drawing toolbar, click Select.
Now, move the cursor to the page, press the left mouse button and drag to cover the triangle and the curve.
Right-click and select Group.
We have now created the basic outline of the  'Water Cycle'.
Create this picture on your own.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Draw.
In this tutorial, you have learnt the basics of working with objects. You have learnt to:
Cut, copy, paste objects
Re-size objects dynamically using handles

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Aggregation facilities in SQL.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Group by ,  Having and  Order by clause.
To record this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 14.04 operating system,
PostgreSQL 9.3.x,
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of SELECT statement and  Aggregate functions.
For more details, refer to the previous RDBMS PostgreSQL tutorials on this website.
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.
We learnt about these functions in the earlier tutorials.
Aggregate functions are mostly used with the Group By clause of the SELECT statement.
Group by clause is used to collect identical data in groups.
It returns one record for each group.
The syntax for group by clause is:
Let’s open the SQL Editor window in pgAdmin for demonstration.
Type the code as shown here and execute the query.
We can see the student details from various departments and cities.
Say, we want to display how many students are there in each department.
Let us write a query.
Now type the code as shown here.
This query will group the records in the students table with the deptid column.
After grouping, the aggregate function 'Count' will count the number of records under each department.
The grouping is based on rows with the same value in the specified column i.e deptid
Note that the table is not physically rearranged.
Let’s execute the code and see the output.
The number of students in each department is displayed  as output.
Next, let us see how to add where condition in the Group by clause.
We will change the same code to add a condition.
Here a where condition is specified to display the total number of students in the department 'CS'.
The Where clause used in a query containing a Group By clause, eliminates the rows before grouping.
Execute the code now to see the output.
Let us see a few more examples of Group by clause.
I want to group the students table to find out the number of male and female students.
Execute the query.
We can see the output as expected.
Now I want to find out the maximum CGPA score of students from each city.
For this, I'll type the query as shown.
Now execute the code to see the output.
Likewise, we can make use of any aggregate function in the SELECT statement with Group by clause.
Next we will see how to use more than one column in Group by clause.
Here, after group by you can see two columns deptid and city.
First it will group the records with department and then group with city, for each department.
The list of column names in the SELECT clause must appear in the Group by clause also.
Next we will learn about the Having clause.
HAVING clause is used to retrieve rows for the specified condition from a grouped result.
Use the WHERE clause to exclude rows that you don't want to group, whereas use the HAVING clause to filter rows after they have been grouped.
The syntax is
We will add the condition 'having city= 'Chennai'.
Note that you can apply HAVING clause only to  columns that appear in the Group By clause  or an aggregate function.
Execute and see the result.
We can see two rows as output.
The condition specifies that the students are from Chennai.
Let’s see another example.
Here, we are using aggregate function 'count' in the having clause.
Here, the student records are grouped by department and then by city.
Once again, execute to see the result.
Next we will see the Order by clause.
Order By clause is used to sort the records in ascending or descending order.
This clause is always used at the end of the SELECT statement.
The syntax is shown here.
Let us switch back to SQL Editor window for demonstration.
Type the code as shown on the screen.
I have added the Order by clause to the end of the SELECT statement.
Now execute the query.
By default, the sorting is always done in ascending order.
Type DESC at the end of the query to sort in descending order.
Execute the query to see the output.
We can also sort result set on multiple columns.
Type the code.
Use a comma to separate the columns.
Columns specified in the ORDER BY clause must be one of the columns selected in the SELECT column list.
Let us see the output. Here the city is sorted in ascending order and within each city the student name is sorted in ascending order.
Let us modify the same query to see city in descending order and the student name in ascending order.
Execute to see the output.
We will see another example of order by in Group by clause.
Here we can see the sorted result of grouped rows.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about the clauses:
As an assignment-  Write a Select statement to display the number of students with the same CGPA.
Hint: Group the rows by CGPA column.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Loops in awk.
To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the previous awk tutorials on our website.
You should have familiarity with any programming language like C or C++.
A loop allows us to perform one or more actions repeatedly.
while, do-while and for are the available loops in awk.
The syntax of 'while' loop can be seen here.
While loop first checks whether the specified condition is true.
If yes, then it executes the code within the body.
We will use the same awkdemo.txt file that we have used earlier.
I have already written a script named while_loop.awk.
The same file is available in the Code Files link of this tutorial.
Here, we have set the field separator as Pipe symbol.
Initially, we have to set the value of the loop variable i as 1.
Here, we have taken one more variable f and initialized it to 1.
Variable f represents the field counter or the position of the fields for each record.
Now, in the while condition, we check if i is less than or equal to 3.
If yes, then it will print the value in the f
Then we will increment the field counter f by 1.
After that, we will also increment the value of loop variable i by 1.
This printf is for printing a newline character at the end of each row.
This loop will be executed for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
Which means, the first 3 fields will get printed for each record.
Let’s execute this code now.
Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space while_loop.awk space awkdemo.txt.
Observe that we get the first three fields of all the rows in the output.
Let us do the same with the do-while loop.
The syntax of do-while loop can be seen here.
The do-while loop always executes the code inside the body once.
Then it checks the specified condition. And, repeats the code inside the body, as long as the specified conditionis true.
I have already written a script and named it as do_loop.awk.
In this code, these are the statements within the do loop which will be executed first.
After that, the statements inside the loop will be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
This loop will iterate for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
Let’s switch to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal.
Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space do underscore loop dot awk space awkdemo dot txt.
We get the same output. Then why do we have both while and do-while loops?
Let us understand the difference.
Switch to the file while underscore loop dot awk.
Now, change the value of loop counter i from 1 to 4.
This will make the specified condition false from the beginning.
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Clear the terminal.
See, we are not getting any output apart from blank lines.
For each record in the awkdemo.txt file, blank lines are getting printed in the output.
Now, let us make some changes in the do loop file.
Switch to the file do underscore loop dot awk.
Change the value of i from 1 to 4.
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Clear the terminal.
In the output, only the first field for each row is printed.
For each row, awk first prints the value at the first field  because value of variable f is initialized to 1.
Since the value of the loop counter i is 4, then the condition is false.
This loop will iterate for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
Which means, the first field for each record will get printed.
We are getting the output at least once for each record.
Use the do-while loop for a job to be executed at least once, irrespective of any other condition.
We can do the same with the for loop also.
The syntax of for loop can be seen here.
The 'for' statement starts by executing initialization.
Then, as long as the condition is true, it repeatedly executes the statements within and then increments.
Assuming your familiarity with a language like C or C++, I am not explaining the syntax in detail.
This is how  for loop for this condition looks like.
Here, initialization, condition checking and variable incrementation are done in the same line.
Try this out by yourself.
There are some more looping constructs:
We will see some relevant examples on these in further tutorials.
We may have a single and multiline comments in our file.
Here, notice that the single line comments are declared with single hash (#) symbol.
The multiline comments are declared with the help of double hash (##) symbol.
Now, there is no point of checking and printing these comments in the output.
We have to skip the lines starting with hash (##) symbol.
Recall the case of giving 50% increment in the stipend for those who are getting more than 8000.
We will use the same example for skipping the comments.
I have created a file named next.awk as shown here, for this execution.
Now, what does this command mean?
awk will search for the pattern caret sign hash symbol(^#) at the beginning of each line.
If the pattern is found, the keyword next tells awk to skip the current line immediately.
Then awk will start processing from the next line in the file.
Switch to the terminal and type the command as shown here.
We get the output without any comments.
Suppose, we have the students’ records in multiple files with the same format.
See, it is similar to our previous file.
It also has comments preceded with hash  symbol.
And, it has large text at the end with double hash ## symbol.
So, our data is in two different files.
Once we reach double hash(##) symbol of the first file, awk should stop processing that file entirely.
Then it has to start the execution from the next file.
Modify the next.awk as shown here.
I have added: dollar zero tilde slash caret symbol double hash slash within braces nextfile semicolon, below the BEGIN statement.
This will search for double hash # symbol at the beginning of each line.
If found, awk will skip the current file to process the next file.
Save this file.
Switch to the the terminal and type the following command.
See, we are getting the output from both the files.
In this tutorial we learnt about-  while,  do… while,  for,  next,  nextfile in awk.
As an assignment for the student records of awkdemo2.txt,  print only even fields(i.e. field 2, field 4 etc.)  irrespective of how many fields are there in the input file.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Abstract Classes.
In this tutorial, we will learn about:  Abstract Methods and Concrete Methods
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes and
How to use Abstract Classes.
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE.
You should also have the knowledge of subclassing in Java.
First we will see about Abstract Method.
An Abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
It is declared using abstract keyword.
There should not be opening and closing parenthesis for this method.
Let us understand the usage of Abstract class with a sample program.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called AbstractDemo.
Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Abstract class.
Now, right-click on src folder and click New > Class.
Type the name of the class as Person and press Enter.
Now we will add the fields to represent the name and the age of the Person. Type:  String name semicolon.
Also type:  int age semicolon.
Now click on Source and select Generate constructor using fields.
The constructor can initialise the values of name and age fields.
Next we will see about concrete method.
A Concrete method is completely implemented within the curly brackets.
We will add a concrete method to this class to print the name and age.
This method showBasicDetails() illustrated here, is an example of concrete method.
Observe that this method is implemented completely.
Now we will add an abstract method to this class.
So, type: public void showDetails( ) semicolon.
An error comes up, since we have not yet added the abstract  keyword.
So, now add the keyword abstract.
Now we can see another error comes up.
This is because, abstract methods can be added only to abstract classes.
So, now add the keyword abstract to the Person class to make it an abstract class.
The class Person illustrated here is an abstract class.
It contains an abstract method called showDetails().
The figure here represents an inheritance relation.
Here, the Person class is an abstract class.
The Employee class and the Student class are subclasses of the Person class.
These subclasses can provide their own different implementations.
These are done by showDetails( ) method present in the Person class.
For example: ShowDetails() Method in the Employee class prints the Employee ID and the Salary, where as ShowDetails() Method in the Student class prints the Student Register Number and Grade.
Then right-click on the default package and create another class called Employee.
Now to make this a subclass of Person class, type:  extends Person.
Now, we can see an error comes up in the Eclipse IDE.
It indicates that we should provide an implementation to the abstract method showDetails( ).
We will do it a little later.
Now create two fields to represent the employee id and employee salary.
So, type:  String empid semicolon and int salary semicolon.
Now click on Source and then select Generate constructor using fields.
This constructor can initialize the values of name, age, empid and salary.
Let us now define the showDetails method. So, type: public void showDetails( ).
Inside this method, we need to print the employee details.
Note that the error disappears, once the showDetails() method is implemented.
Next we will see a Student class of the project.
I have already created a subclass called Student.
There are two fields in the Student class – register number and grade which represent student register number and grade.
A constructor is also created inside this class.
This constructor can be used to initialize the values for name, age, register number and grade.
The showDetails method is also implemented in this class.
It prints the values of Student Register Number and grade.
Now note that the Employee class has its own implementation of showDetails().
And the Student class has its own implementation of showDetails().
Now right-click on the default package.
Click on New > Class and then type name as Demo.
Inside this class, we will have the main method.
So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method.
Now let us try to instantiate the Person class by typing Person p equals new Person.
Within brackets and double quotes type John and put a semicolon.
Now we can see an error. This is because the Person class is abstract and it cannot be instantiated.
Let's remove this line.
Now, let us instantiate the Person class using the Employee class as Person p1 equals new Employee.
In the first line, we are passing the values of different arguments.
John is passed as Employee name.
40 as the value of age.
E267 as the value of Employee ID and 10000 as the value of Employee salary.
Now we can invoke the concrete method in the Person class as p1.showBasicDetails().
We can also call the showDetails() method using the object p1 as p1.showDetails().
Similarly instantiate the Person class using the Student class.
This is represented as Person p2 equals new Student.
Now we are passing the values of different arguments.
We can invoke the showBasicDetails() method and showDetails() method using the object as shown.
Now let us run this Demo program.
So, right-click on the class Demo and then select Run as > Java Application.
We can see the output with the basic employee details like name and age.
These are printed by showBasicDetails() method.
Other employee details like employee ID and salary are printed by the showDetails() method.
Similarly the basic student details like name and age are printed by showBasicDetails() method.
Other details of the student like Student register number and grade are printed by the showDetails() method.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about: Abstract Methods and Concrete Methods
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes and  How to create and use Abstract Classes.
As an assignment,  create an abstract class Vehicle which contains an abstract method run().
Create asubclass Car which extends the Vehicle class and implements the run method that prints “Car is running on 4 wheels”.
Also create asubclass Bike which again extends the Vehicle class and implements the run method that prints “Bike is running on 2 wheels”.
Also create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Working with Remote Repositories.
In this tutorial, we will learn -  What is Remote repository and
How to synchronize data to the Remote repository
For this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 14.04
Git 2.3.2
gedit Text Editor and
Firefox web browser
You can use any editor and web browser of your choice.
For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection.
You should also have knowledge of basics of Git commands.
If not, for relevant Git tutorials, please visit the link shown.
First let us understand what is a Remote repository.
A repository which is hosted on the internet or any network is called Remote repository.
Using this centralized repository, people can collaborate on a project from anywhere in the world, at anytime.
Say, for example, there are 3 users who want to work jointly in the same repository.
Git allows them to take a copy of the Remote repository into their local system.
This will be done using clone command.
Then they can work offline with the local repository.
Once the work is satisfied, they have to synchronize it back to the main repository.
This will be done using Push and pull commands.
You will understand the full process at the end of this tutorial.
First we will open our GitHub repository which we created earlier.
In the right side, we can see the URL of this repository.
Let’s copy this URL.
We are going to make a copy of this repository using the URL to create a local repository.
Let’s open the terminal.
Let us understand now how two users can work in the same Remote repository.
For this, I have already created two directories named User1 and User2 on my Desktop.
Please do so on your Desktop also.
In the same terminal, I will open the directories in 2 different tabs.
In the first tab, type cd space User1
To open second tab, click on File menu and select Open Tab.
In the second tab, type cd User2
Let us go to the tab User1.
Now let us make a copy of the Remote repository.
Type git space clone and then paste the copied URL  space  and type a dot at the end of this command.
Dot indicates that we are going to copy the repository inside the same directory i.e. User1.
Otherwise, it will create a new directory with the repository name as stories.
The clone command will copy the whole central folder and make it as a local repository.
Type ls. You can see that the content of the Remote repository is copied here.
Next, I will change the user name and email id of this repository for better understanding.
I have already created two more GitHub users - priya-spoken1 and kaushik-spoken - for demonstration purpose.
I will use them here.
Let us check the Git log.
You can see the same commits of the Remote repository.
Likewise, I will clone the repository inside the directory User2 in the second tab.
Here also I will change the user name and email id as I did earlier for User1.
Next, let us understand how these users will work in the Remote repository.
Let’s say, User1 will be working on a file named lion-and-mouse.html.
To create the file, type gedit lion-and-mouse.html.
I will copy and paste some text into this file, from my Writer document, which I had saved earlier.
Likewise, you can add some content into your file.
Let's add the file into the staging area.
Type git add lion-and-mouse.html
Next let us commit the newly added file.
Type git commit hyphen m within quotes Added lion-and-mouse.html.
Next we have to synchronize the local repository with the main Remote repository.
Before synchronizing the repository, we will learn about remotes.
The URL of a Remote repository is called Remote.
We can give a nickname to the URL.
It will be useful when we work on many Remote repositories.
When we synchronize the repository, we can simply use the nickname, instead of typing the full URL.
The default nickname of a Remote is always origin.
Now let us learn how to add a Remote.
Switch back to our terminal.
Type git remote. You can see that the default Remote name is origin.
Next let us see how to add a nickname to the Remote.
Type git remote add stories and type the URL of the Remote repository.
Here I will name the Remote as stories that is the Remote repository name.
Now press Enter key.
Again to check the Remote list, type git remote.
You can see that the Remote is added to the list.
Now we will synchronize the local repository with the main Remote repository.
To do so, type git push stories master
Here stories is the Remote name and master is the branch where we update the changes.
I will type priya-spoken1 as username of User1 and press Enter.
Type the corresponding password of User1.
Recall that I created this username earlier for demonstration purpose.
Please use your username and password here.
It throws an error unable to access.
Why did this error occur? This is because we don't have access to the Remote repository.
So now, let us learn how to give access permission to the contributors.
Switch back to GitHub repository.
Click on the last tab - Settings - in the top panel.
Then click on Collaborators link in the left side box.
Type your GitHub account password for confirmation.
Here in the text box, we can add the names of the collaborators.
Understand that anyone can clone this GitHub repository.
But the people who we add as collaborator, can push to the repository.
Now I will add the two users priya-spoken1 and kaushik-spoken.
You can see that the user name is listed when I type in the text box.
Click on Add Collaborator button to add the user as collaborator.
I will also add the other user kaushik-spoken.
You can see here the added names are listed.
Now we will try to push into the Remote repository.
Switch back to  terminal.
Type git push stories master
Give the username and password of the user who has the access to the repository.
You can see that we have pushed it successfully.
Next, let us check the GitHub repository to see whether our changes are updated.
Switch back to the GitHub repository.
Click on the Code tab.
Let’s check the commit list.
You can see that the commit of the collaborator is listed here.
Next, let us learn how User2 can collaborate with the Remote repository.
Let’s say, User2 is working on a file named friends.html.
To create the file, type gedit friends.html.
I will copy and paste some text into this file, from my Writer document.
Likewise, you can add some content into your file.
Let's add the file into the staging area.
Next let’s commit the newly added file.
Type git commit hyphen m within quotes Added friends.html.
Next we have to synchronize the local repository with the main Remote repository.
Type git push origin master
Remember that we didn't add Remote to this local repository.
So here we are using the default Remote name origin.
Type the GitHub username and password of the User2.
It throws an error which says failed to push.
Also, it shows the reason for the error: the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
Remember that the User1 has pushed a commit earlier.
But User2 doesn't have the work of User1 in its local repository.
It also gives a suggestion to run git pull command to rectify the error.
So first, we have to pull down the work of User1 and incorporate it into the User2’s local repository. Let’s do it now.
Type git pull origin master
First it will fetch the data from Remote repository then merge it with the local repository.
So it opens an editor to give a message for merging.
Let’s keep the same message and close the editor by pressing Ctrl + X.
Now again, we will try to push the data. Type git push origin master
Give the username and password of User2.
You can see that we could successfully push the data now.
Next let us check the GitHub repository to see whether our changes are updated.
Switch back to the GitHub repository.
Click on the repository name Stories.
You can see that the file friends.html is now added to the repository.
Let’s check the commit list now.
You can see that the commit of User2 is also listed here.
What is Remote repository and
How to synchronize data to the Remote repository
As an assignment,  Create one more user named User3
Clone data for User3
Start working on the local repository of User3 and
Try to push data from User3
The Spoken Tutorial Project Team conducts workshops and gives certificates to those who pass online tests.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Panel connections and Software interface.
We will also learn to demonstrate:
Here I am using,
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with ExpEYES Junior  interface. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
Let's discuss about the utilities of  ExpEYES Junior device.
The device can be used to carry out experiments in:
It can be used in fields such as- Electricity, Sound, Magnetism, Light, Diode, Transistors and others.
Let's begin with terminals on the top of Panel. Panel has four ground (GND) terminals. At these terminals, the voltage is zero volt (0 V).
Voltage measured at other input terminals is with reference to ground(GND) terminals.
Input terminals A1 and A2  can measure voltage between -5V to +5V.
On the left, IN1 and IN2 terminals can measure voltage between 0 to 5V.
IN1 also measures capacitance up to 5000 pF(pico farads), with good accuracy.
PVS is Programmable voltage source. It is used to deliver voltages in 0-5 Volts range with a minimum step of 1.25 mV (milli volts) and can deliver up to 5 mA (milli amps).
SINE delivers a constant frequency around 150 Hz, at an amplitude around 4 volts.
SEN is mainly used for connective sensor elements like
It is a voltage measuring terminal with an internal 5.1K resistor connected to 5 volts.
SQR1 and SQR2  terminals can generate
OD1 produces a digital output as 0V or 5V,  under Software control.
MIC captures sound from an external sound source.
CCS means Constant Current Source.
It gives 1 mA(one milli Amp) current with a load resistor of 3 kΩ(kilo ohms), since voltage should be kept below 4 volts.
Inverting amplifier  is used to amplify external voltages. It may be used to amplify external condenser or mic output.
Along with the device, some accessories are provided.
Accessories list includes:
Screwdriver
Two silicon diodes
Four 5mm LEDS
This is a graphical user interface (GUI) of ExpEYES Junior. GUI is known as Plot window.
On the left side of the Plot window, we have input terminals: A1, A2, IN1, IN2, SEN, SQ1 and SQ2.
ATR, WHI and other trigger sources are  used to fix the waveform.
We will discuss about ATR, WHI and other trigger sources in the upcoming tutorials.
CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4 are plotting channels with sliders.
Channel sliders on the right are used to  move the waveform on the Plot Window.
Click on A1 and drag to CH1. We can see the connection information in the box below.
Click on A2 and drag to CH2. We can see the connection information as before.
Drag channel CH2 to FIT. It shows the voltage and frequency of A2.
Drag CH2 to NML. It removes the display shown by FIT.
msec/div(milli second/division) represents time axis.
Volt/div represents  volt axis.
Trig level is a trigger controller.
Click on CH2 and drag to DEL. It removes CH2.
Click on CH1 and drag to DEL. It disables the display of CH1.
FTR generates Fourier spectrum of the wave.
Under Setting Squarewaves, we have a number of input and check boxes.
In this input box, we can change the frequency of the wave in Hertz.
This is to change phase difference- dphi, in percentage(%).
In Set PVS= input box, we can enter the desired voltage value between 0 to 5V. Press Enter to set the value.
SQR1, SQR2 and BOTH check boxes  are used to activate the frequency. Frequency can be changed using the slider.
Set State check boxes are used to control OD1 and CCS.
Measure C on IN1 button is used to measure Capacitance.
Measure R on SEN button  is used to measure Resistance.
Below the buttons, we have a command window to type Python code. We will discuss about  Python code in upcoming tutorials.
Save Traces to button to save traces as ".txt" files.
We will discuss about LOOP check box, SCAN and XMG buttons in later tutorials.
EXPERIMENTS button displays list of experiments. Quit button is used to close the window.
Now, I will demonstrate Ohm's law using the device and its interface.
In this experiment, we will show the dependency of voltage across a resistor and verify Ohm’s law.
The device is connected to the system.
In this experiment, PVS is connected to IN1 through 2.2 KΩ (kilo ohms) resistance. IN1 is connected to ground (GND) through 1KΩ (kilo ohms).
This is the circuit diagram for the connection.
Open the software interface.
In the Plot window, click on IN1 to measure the voltage.
For PVS=1 Volt, the corresponding value of IN1 is 0.309 Volt.
Let us perform an experiment to check the effective resistance in series combination.
In this experiment, we will show the voltage when resistors are connected in series.
In this experiment-
On the Plot window, select the CCS check box. Click on IN1 to show the voltage.
This is the circuit diagram for the connection.
When 1 KΩ (kilo ohms) resistor is connected to CCS and GND, measured voltage is 0.979V.
Likewise, for 560 Ω(ohms) resistance, measured voltage is  0.543V.
For a series combination of 1 KΩ (kilo ohms) and 560Ω(ohms) resistances, measured voltage is 1.524V'.
Let us perform an experiment to check the effective resistance in parallel combination.
In this experiment, we will show the voltage when resistors are connected in parallel.
In this experiment, IN1 is connected to CCS. CCS is connected to ground(GND) through a resistor.
This is the circuit diagram for the connection.
On the Plot window, select the CCS check box. Click on IN1 to show the voltage.
The experiment is first carried out with 1000Ω(ohms) resistor then with parallel combination of two 1000 Ω(ohms) resistors.
This is the circuit diagram for 1000 Ω(ohm) resistance in parallel combination. The measured value of IN1 is 0.952V.
This is the circuit diagram for parallel combination of two 1000 Ω(ohm) resistors. The measured value of IN1 is 0.474V.
Again the experiment is carried out- first with  2.2K Ω(kilo ohms) resistor,  then with parallel combination of two  2.2 KΩ(kilo ohms) resistors.
This is the circuit diagram for 2.2K Ω(kilo ohms), resistance. The measured value of IN1 is 2.132V
This is the circuit diagram for parallel combination of two 2.2KΩ(kilo ohms) resistance. The measured value of IN1 is 1.063V.
We have also learnt to demonstrate:
We conduct workshops using Spoken Tutorials  and give certificates. Please contact us.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Blocks in Admin's Dashboard.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to add and delete blocks and set the Front page.
Moodle 3.3 and  Firefox web browser.
Learners of this tutorial should have basic knowledge of the Admin’s dashboard.
Switch to the browser and open your Moodle site.
Login with your admin username and password details.
We are now in the Admin’s dashboard.
Recall that Blocks serve a specific purpose or information and are found on all pages of Moodle.
Let us understand how we can work with Moodle Blocks now.
Depending on the theme used, blocks can be on the right side or on both sides.
Blocks contain information we want people to see whenever they log in.
There are many types of blocks available in Moodle. And, they can be moved or arranged easily as per our preferences.
We will now add a few blocks to our dashboard.
Click on the navigation menu on the left of the page.
Click on Customise this page button on the right hand side of the dashboard.
Notice that a new menu item Add a block is visible now. Click on Add a block.
A new pop-up window opens. We need to select the type of block that we want to add.
For example, click on Messages. You can see that the Messages block now appears in the dashboard.
Currently there are no messages.
By default, all new blocks get added to the right-most column.
Let us add one more block. Click on Add a block menu on the left.
Select HTML from the list of menu types.
Using this, we can embed widgets such as Library widgets, News feeds, Twitter, Facebook etc.
Notice now that a NEW HTML BLOCK has been added below the Messages block.
Click on the gear icon in the HTML block.
Configure HTML block has 3 sections:
By default, the first section is expanded.
Click on Expand all to expand all the sections.
In the Block title, let’s type: “Things to do”.
Let us add some tasks for this admin user in the Content area.
Type the following: Create a new course,  Create new users,  Add users to the course.
The editor is an HTML editor and can be used like any other word processor or editor.
Scroll down to see the options under Where this block appears.
Under Default region, select Content.
The lower the weight of a block, the higher it will appear in that region.
By selecting -10, I am ensuring that it is at the top of the content region.
This block  will appear on the Admin’s dashboard.
Now comes the “On this page” section.
In our case, this is the dashboard.
that is, the Where this block appears section.
Please note that depending on the type of the block, configuration settings will vary.
Click Save Changes to save the changes and go back to the dashboard.
See that the new HTML block with the title Things to do is now visible.
We can also change the position of a block by dragging it using the Move icon.
Let us move Things to do block below the Course Overview block by dragging and dropping it.
Let us see how this changes the configuration we set a few minutes back.
Click on the gear icon and then on Configure Things to do block.
Scroll down to see “On this page” section. The weight has changed to -2 (minus two).
Click Cancel to go back to the dashboard.
We do not need this Learning Plans block. So let us delete it.
Confirm pop-up window appears and prompts us to make sure about this deletion.
Notice that the Learning Plans block is no longer available.
Let us now customize the front page of our Moodle installation.
Click on Site Administration link on the left menu.
Scroll down to locate Front Page settings in the Front page section. Click on it.
Let us change the Full Site Name to Digital India Learning Management System.
This is the text that appears at the top of every page above the breadcrumbs.
Short name is the text that appears in the title of the page.
Notice that the title of this page is Digital India LMS followed by the name of the page we are in.
Short name is also used as a logo text if we do not provide any logo image. We will leave it as it is.
Scroll down to see drop-downs for Front page items.
All visitors, whether they are logged in or not, can see these items.
The order is determined by a combination box. We will leave this as it is.
So, all users will be able to see the list of courses (if available) and nothing else.
Next is the Front page items when logged in.
Let us select Enrolled courses in the first drop-down.
We will leave the rest of the options with their default values.
Scroll down and click on Save Changes.
Let us now summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt to add an HTML block called “Things to do” and specified where it should appear on the page.
We also set up the frontpage for guests and logged-in users.
This script has been contributed by Priyanka.
Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer-Printing and Viewing documents.
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:
Viewing Documents. Printing Documents.
So, let us start our tutorial by learning about the various viewing options in LibreOffice Writer.
There are basically two widely used viewing options in Writer.
They are Print Layout and Web Layout.
The Print Layout option displays how the document will look when printed.
The Web Layout option displays the document as seen in a Web browser.
This is useful when you want to create HTML documents as well as when you want to view the document in full screen mode for editing them.
To access the Print Layout option, click on the View option and then click on the Print Layout option.
In order to access the Web Layout option, click on the View option in the menu bar and then click on the Web Layout option.
Apart from both these options, one can also view the document in full screen mode.
Click on the View option in the menu bar and then click on the Full Screen option.
The full screen mode is useful for editing the documents as well as for projecting them on a projector.
In order to exit the full screen mode, press the Escape key on the keyboard.
We see that the document exits the full screen mode.
Now, let's click on the Print Layout option in View menu.
Before proceeding further, let us add a new page to our document by clicking Insert >> Manual Break  and choosing the Page break option.
We will learn about this, in more details, in another tutorial.
Another option for viewing the document is called Zoom.
Click on the View option in the menu bar and then  click on Zoom.
You see that a  Zoom and View Layout dialog-box appears in front of us.
It has headings namely- Zoom factor and View layout.
The Zoom factor sets the zoom factor to display the current document and all documents of the same type that you open thereafter.
It has useful options which we will discuss one by one.
On clicking the Optimal option, you get the most favorable view of the document.
The Fit width and height view fits the document across the entire width and height of the page.  Thereby it displays one page at a time.
It makes the viewing and editing of multiple pages of a document much easier.
Next option is Fit to Width.  This fits the page to its width.
100% view will display the page in its actual size.
Next we have the most important viewing option called the Variable.
In the variable field, you can enter the zoom factor at which you want to display the document.
For example, we enter the value as 75% in the Variable field and then click on the OK button.
Likewise, you can change the zoom factor according to your need and convenience for viewing and editing the documents.
Another feature in the dialog-box is the View layout.
The View layout option is for text documents.
It is used to reduce the zoom factor to see the effects of different view layout settings in the document.
It has options like Automatic and  Single page for displaying pages side by side and beneath each other respectively.
For example- if we select the Fit width and height option under Zoom factor, then click on the Single page option under the View layout option and finally click on the OK button, we see that the pages are displayed one below the other.
Now click on the Automatic option and then click on the OK button.
You see that the pages are displayed in side by side manner.
The three controls on the Writer Status Bar also allow to change the zoom and view layout of our document.
The View Layout icons from left to right are as follows: Single column mode, view mode with pages side by side and book mode with two pages as in an open book.
We can also drag the Zoom slider to the right to zoom into a page or to the left to show more pages.
Before learning about printing in 'LibreOffice Writer', let us learn something about Page preview.
Click on File and click on Page Preview.
The Page Preview bar appears when you view the current document in the page preview mode.
It basically shows how your document will look like, when it is printed.
You can see the preview of our 'resume.odt' file.
There are various control options in the tool bar of the preview page.
There are options to Zoom In, Zoom Out, Next page, Previous page and Print.
After learning how to view documents in LibreOffice Writer as well as Page Preview, we will now learn how a Printer functions in LibreOffice Writer.
A printer, in simple words, is an output device used to print a document.
We will now see how to access the various options of Print.
Click on theTools in the menu bar -> and then click on Options.
Click on the arrow beside LibreOffice Writer and finally click on  Print.
A dialog-box appears on the screen, giving you options to select from.
So, we keep the default settings and then click on the OK button.
Now, to directly print the entire document, click on the Print File Directly icon in the toolbar.
This is known as Quick Printing.
You can have more control over printing any document by accessing the Print option and changing the default settings.
Click on the File menu in the menu bar and then click on Print.
The Print dialog-box appears on the screen.
Here, we select the Generic Printer option in General Tab.
The All pages option is for printing all the pages of the document.
If you want to print a range of pages, you can select the Pages option and enter the range in the field. For e.g.- we will type 1-3 here. This will print the first three pages of the document.
If you want to print multiple copies of the document then enter the value in  the “Number  of copies” field. Let us enter the value 2 in the field.
Now, let us click on the Options tab in the dialog-box.
A list of options appears on the screen from where you can select and print in the document.
We see a check-box namely- Print in reverse page order.
This option makes it easier to collect large outputs.
So, click on the check-box against it.
You can also take a print out of your 'pdf' document.
We have already seen how to convert a dot odt document to a dot pdf file.
Since we have already saved the pdf file on the desktop, we will double-click on the pdf file.
Now click on the File option and then click on Print.
Let us keep the default settings and then click on the Print Preview button.
You see that the preview of the file on the screen.
Now, click on the Print this document icon in the preview page, in order to print it.
Viewing Documents.
Printing Documents.
COMPREHENSIVE ASSIGNMENT-
Write the text "This is LibreOffice Writer" in Writer.
Use the Full Screen option to get a full screen view of the document.
Use the Zoom option to have an optimal as well as Variable view of the document. Set the variable value as 50% and then view the document.
Have a Page preview of the document and print two copies of the document with borders on the page.

Hello everyone and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Laying the foundation of the biogas plant.
This tutorial is particularly useful for masons.
We are going to learn how to construct a biogas plant that  is based on the Deenbandhu model and  has a capacity of 2 cubic meters.
To begin with, we should know the following:
The biogas plant consists of 3 different tanks- mixing tank , digester tank with the dome and the slurry tank.
The standard dimensions of these tanks are as follows.
Mixing tank has a diameter of 22 inches and height 2 feet.
Gas holder dome has a  diameter of  7 feet and 6 inches and height 4 feet  at the center.
The upper slurry tank has a length of 5 feet and 2 inches, width of  3 feet and 2 inches and depth of 4 feet.
The  lower slurry tank has length of  2 feet, width  2 feet and depth 2 feet 2 inches.
For ease of understanding for the mason, this video is classified into day-wise activities.
Day-1 begins with digging of the area at the site of the biogas plant.
As shown here, use lime powder to mark the outline of the digester tank and the slurry tank.
Lime powder is easily available in any hardware store.
Once the area is marked, start digging.
Dig a circular pit of 8 feet diameter and 4 feet depth using a shovel.
Just adjacent to the big pit, dig another pit of  2 feet and 5 inches of length, 1 foot of breadth and 4 feet of depth.
Two laborers can dig these pits in two days.
Alternately, 3 laborers can complete this task in one day.
The epicenter of the pit should be concave in shape  and should be 2 feet deeper than the rest of the pit.
Effort should be made to keep the wall of the pit as straight as possible.
This completes the activities for Day-1.
Let’s move on to Day-2.
The activities of Day-2 are as follows-
Lay foundation for the digester tank.
Construct the dome for the digester tank using chicken mesh.
Construct the mixing tank and
prepare the walls of the slurry tank.
In this tutorial, we will only learn about the digging of the pit and laying foundation for the digester tank.
The other construction topics will be covered in separate tutorials subsequently.
So, now we have completed the digging of the pit. And, we are ready to lay the foundation.
So, let us prepare the plaster mixture for the foundation.
The plaster mixture is basically the gravel and cement mixture.
Preparation of this mixture is as follows-
sand - 200 kgs,
cement - 60 kgs,
gravel - 150 kgs,
and 250 ml of liquid waterproofing material, thoroughly stirred in 20 liters of water.
Now, pour this liquid over the dry gravel-cement mixture.
Add adequate amount of water to mix everything well so that the mixture is thick in consistency.
Use a shovel for mixing everything as shown in the image.
The gravel-cement mixture is now ready to be used.
Use a small trowel to lay this mixture at the base of the pit, in a circular manner.
The thickness of the plaster should be 3 inches from the ground.
This will form the floor of the pit. Recall that the floor of the pit is concave in shape.
So, the foundation will also be concave in shape.
Carefully raise the side walls of the pit up to 3 inches using the same mixture. However, do not raise the concave part.
Keep in mind- The raised edge of the foundation must be flattened using a small trowel.
This is to ensure proper balance of the dome after it is placed.
After the foundation has been laid, leave it for curing for 12 hours.
Notice the elevated walls and the concave pit, in the image shown.
Also, notice the flattened edges.
With this, we complete this tutorial.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to lay foundation of the biogas plant.

Now let us see if there are differences between the KTouch keyboard, laptop keyboard and desktop keyboard.
Notice that the KTouch keyboard and the keyboards used in desktops and laptops are similar.
Look at this slide.It displays the fingers and their names.
Fingers, from left to right, are named:
Ring finger, Middle finger,
Index finger and Thumb.
On your keyboard, place your left hand on the left side of the keyboard.
Ensure that the little finger is on alphabet ‘A’.
Ring finger is on the alphabet ‘S’,
Middle finger on alphabet ‘D’,
Index finger on alphabet ‘F’.
Now, place your right hand on the right side of the keyboard.
Ensure that the little finger is on the colon/semi-colon key.
Ring finger on the alphabet ‘L’,
Middle finger on the alphabet ‘K’,
Index finger on the alphabet ‘J’.
Use your right thumb to press the space bar.
The first time you open KTouch, the Teacher’s Line displays default text.
This text lists instructions on how to select the lecture and begin the typing lessons.
For the purposes of this tutorial, we shall skip typing the default text and select a lecture.
However, you can pause this tutorial and type the default text.
Now, let us select the lecture to begin the typing lessons.
From the main menu, select File, click Open Lecture.
The Select Training Lecture File – ‘KTouch’ dialog box appears.
Browse the flowing folder path
and select english.ktouch.xml and click Open.
Notice that the Teacher’s Line now displays a different set of characters.
Now, let us start typing.
By default, the Level is set to 1 and the Speed is set to zero.
The New Characters in This Level displays the characters we will learn in this level.
Notice that the cursor is in the Student’s Line.
Let us type the character displayed in the teacher's line using the keyboard.
As we type, the characters are displayed in the 'Student’s Line'.
Look at the Speed field now.
As you type, the number increases or decreases based on the speed of your typing.
If you stop typing, the speed count decreases.
Now, let’s type the numbers seven & eight which are not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The 'Student Line' has become red.
Why? That’s because we have mistyped or made an error in typing.
Let’s delete it and complete the typing.
When you reach the end of the line, press the Enter key to move to the second line.
Notice, that the 'Teacher’s Line' now displays the next set of characters to type.
The 'Student’s line' is cleared of the typed text.
Let’s check how accurately we have typed.
The Correctness field displays the percentage of correctness of your typing. For example, it may display 80 percent.
We have completed our first typing lesson!
Let’s begin a new typing session.
Click Start New Session.
In the Start new training session – ‘KTouch’ dialog box, click Start from First Level.
What do you see?
A set of characters are displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The 'Student’s Line' is cleared of all characters and is blank.
Let’s start typing.

Hello everyone!! Welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on construction of the dome of the digester tank.
The tutorials on digging of the pit and laying the foundation  are available on Spoken-tutorial.org website.
In this tutorial, we will learn the step-by-step procedure for constructing a dome.
So, what is a dome?
Dome is an arch like structure placed on the digester tank where the biogas is collected.
Construction of the dome is a very interesting and important procedure.
Items used for construction are  steel rods, chicken mesh and  steel wire.
Detailed specifications of these are mentioned in the tutorial on materials required.
Now, put 12 marks on the circumference of the circle and number them from 1 to 12, as shown.
These 12 marks should be separated by a distance of two feet from each other.
Next, hammer twelve 10-inches steel rods all along the marked circumference.
Hammer 10-inches steel rods up to 2 inches in the ground.
Remember that they have to be removed later.
Next comes the use of 12-feet long steel rods.
With the 12-feet long steel rods, we’ll make an outer circle around the hammered 10-inches steel rods.
I will now tell you how to make a circle using the hollow rod.
Use an iron rod having hollow ends.
With this iron rod, bend the 12-feet steel rods to form a circular shape.
Then place the circular steel rods around the smaller 10-inches steel rods, as shown.
We will need two 12 feet rods to complete the circle.
Now tie the circular steel rods to the 10-inch steel rods using steel wires, as shown.
Ensure that the knot is tied very tightly and the steel rod circle is very stable.
This is the base of the dome.
Hence it has to be very strong to bear the load of the plastered dome later.
Now, hammer a 4-feet and 2 inches long bamboo stick in the center of the circle, as shown.
Hammer the bamboo stick up to 2 inches in the ground.
Ensure that it can stand firmly by itself and  can be easily removed later.
This bamboo stick should be able to temporarily support the frame of the dome.
Now, let’s start building the frame of the dome.
Again, use the hollow iron rod and bend a 12-ft long steel rod to form an arch like shape.
This arch will give the semi-circular shape to the dome.
Hence, ensure that the arch is symmetric on either side when bent.
Similarly, bend 2 more 12-feet rods to form arches.
Let me explain exactly how the arches have to be placed on the circumference using a diagram.
Secure one end of the arch at rod number 1 and the other end of the arch at rod number 7.
This will ensure perfect symmetry to the arch and it will rest on the bamboo stick in the centre.
Use steel wires to tie the arch together with the hammered 10-inches steel rod and the circular ring.
For tying, make a knot like structure with the steel wire, as shown here.
Do likewise at the opposite end of the arch as well.
Next we will tie two more arches.
Secure the second arch to rod number 3 and rod number 9.
And, secure the third arch to rod number 5 and rod number 11.
The 12 feet steel rod arches should be at an angular separation of 60 degrees at the base.
Now, we have three arches for the frame of the dome.
Next, carefully slide the steel rods at the top such that a small gap is left open in between.
Tie the steel rods using the steel wires as shown.
Intersection of the three arches will look like a triangle.
The sides of the triangle should be approximately 2.5 inches  as shown in the image.
The top view of the framework should look like this after tying.
What you see here is the mason showing the exact position of the open triangular gap using the bamboo stick.
This gap is where the main gas pipe of 1 inch diameter will  fit.
Once the arches have been fixed, we have to make circular rings with the remaining 12-feet steel rods.
First let us understand how to make these rings with the help of a diagram.
This is the framework we constructed so far,
circular base and  semi-circular arches.
Now we need to fix 8 circular rings such that they can be placed on the arches, as shown.
The rings have to be uniformly separated by a distance of 8 inches between each of them.
To make circular rings, start from the top and gradually move downwards.
Two things to keep in mind while making circular rings are:
the length of the steel rod would depend upon the position of the circular ring on the frame.
longer steel rods would be required as we gradually go from top to bottom.
We will first have to cut the steel rods to the required length before we fix the rings.
So, let’s do that.
For the first ring which is the smallest ring at the top, we will need approximately 4 feet and 7 inches steel rod, adding 2 feet extra for tying.
Diameter of this circular ring will be 10 inches.
For the second ring, we will need approximately 7 feet and 1 inch of steel rod.
Diameter of this ring will be 1 foot and 7 inches.
For the third ring, 9 feet and 8 inches steel rod would be required;
diameter would be 2 feet and 5 inches.
Fourth ring will require 12 feet 3 inches long  steel rod;
diameter of this ring will be 3 feet and 3 inches.
The fifth ring will need 14 feet and 10 inches long steel rod;
diameter of this ring will be 4 feet and 1 inch.
Sixth ring will require 17 feet and 4 inches long  rod;
diameter of this ring will be 4 feet and 10 inches.
Remember, as mentioned while explaining the first circular ring , an extra 2 feet has been calculated for tying the rods together with steel wires, for all the 8 rings.
And the diameter for all the 8 rings is calculated excluding the 6 inches.
Now come the 7th and 8th rings.
Both will be used for making the circular rings and also the entrance of the dome.
Measurements for these two rings are-
The seventh ring will require 20 feet and 10 inches long steel rod.
And, for eighth ring 23 feet and 5 inches long steel rod would be required.
Keep in mind that this includes the measurement for the bent rods as well.
As soon as three circular rings are placed, an important thing to be done is:
Place 6 bamboo sticks of length 4 feet in an inclined position inside the frame of the dome.
Note that bamboo sticks have to be spread out uniformly from the centre of the base.
And, should be firmly rested against the circular rings or the arches.
These sticks will further give support to the frame of the dome.
Please note that if you follow the measurements mentioned earlier then you will get a uniform distance of 8 inches between each circular ring.
To confirm this, use a 1 foot steel scale having two hooves.
The distance between these two hooves should be 8 inches
and it should fit in between two circular rings as shown here.
However, you may ignore minor variations, if any.
Just after placing the 6th circular ring, an important thing to be done is  to fix vertical rods on the frame.
I will explain how to do that:
Between two half-arches, fix a steel rod of length 5 feet and 5 inches bisecting the two main arches.
Tie this rod using steel wires from the base ring up to the first ring as shown in the image.
Similarly, fix two more steel rods of 4 feet and 7 inches, bisecting the half-arch and the 5 feet and 5 inches steel rod.
Tie these two rods using steel wires from the base ring up to the second ring, as shown.
Please note- between the 5th and 6th 10 inches hammered steel rods, do the following:
The 4 feet 7 inches long steel rod has to be bent and tied to the 6th ring.
This is done to make space for the entrance of the dome as shown in the image.
Note that in both cases, extra 3 inches have been left at the top for the ease of tying the steel wire to the circular rings.
Now we will fix the last two circular rings i.e. the 7th and 8th ring.
However, it is to be noted that between 6th and 8th ring will be the gap or the entrance to the dome.
This gap should be big enough for the mason to enter inside the dome.
Size of this gap would be approximately 2 feet of width and 2 feet of height.
Use 7th and 8th rings to make gap of the mentioned size.
Bend the 7th rod to make the upper side of the entrance, as shown in the image and bend the 8th ring downward.
This will make the lower end of the gap or entrance as shown in the image.
Now, tie the bent 7th and 8th rings firmly with steel wires.
Next comes covering the frame of the dome with chicken mesh.
Use a metal scissor to cut the required size of the chicken mesh.
Start covering the frame tightly with the mesh, from top to bottom.
To tie the mesh to the frame, stretch the mesh tightly and tie it to the frame with steel wires.
This can be done by using a metal hook.
To tighten the layers of the chicken mesh-insert the hook into the hole(s) of the two layers.
Rotate the hook by stretching the mesh and simultaneously entwining the meshes.
Please note- if the chicken mesh is not stretched tightly then cracks might appear later while plastering the dome.
Remember to leave an extra 4-5 inches of chicken mesh at the nape of the frame.
Reason for this will be explained while fixing the dome on the digester tank.
The entire frame should be covered with 3 bundles of chicken mesh.
This would form approximately 3 layers over the dome.
The multiple layers of chicken mesh will help to hold the cement firmly while plastering the dome.
Chicken mesh covering the entrance to the dome, should be cut with scissors.
What you see here is the mason getting inside the dome through the same gap or the entrance.
Once the chicken mesh is fixed, remove the bamboo sticks placed inside for support.
Please note that the sticks have to be gently removed so as to not disturb the frame of the dome.
Do so carefully and slowly.
The mesh dome is now ready and can be placed on the digester tank.
Before shifting, untie the 10 inches hammered steel rod from the base ring
and make sure of re-tying the loose ends of the mesh.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial of constructing a dome for the biogas plant.
Fixing of the dome on the biogas plant will be explained in a later tutorial.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt the step-by-step procedure to construct the dome of the digester tank.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Modifying the Page Layout.
First, we will learn about layout.
Here, we will get an introduction to Themes and Blocks.
Themes gives us the general layout, look and feel of our site.
I will introduce you to Themes in a little while.
For now, understand that a Theme can be applied to a Drupal site, without changing the content.
And, it gives us the colour scheme, location of the Blocks and all the formatting for the text and images.
Previously, we learnt that Blocks are information that can be placed in various areas of a site.
Blocks go into Block regions and Block regions are determined by the Theme.
In the design area,
Please note, we didn’t talk about or apply our Themes earlier.
This was done to highlight the fact that we can apply a Theme at any point while building a site.
The only reason we’ve waited till now is to show that we can wait till the very end to apply a Theme.
But, I will always prefer to apply my Theme as soon as it’s ready.
Let’s now get into the layout with a look at Blocks and Block regions.
Blocks enable us to place information anywhere on our site.
Go to Structure and Block layout.
All the blocks that are available from our current theme are here.
For e.g: Header, Primary Menu, Secondary Menu and others.
We’ve actually already placed a few of those.
Recall, we had placed the "Welcome To Drupalville" custom block in the sidebar.
It appears in the left sidebar on this particular theme.
We also added a "Recent Events Added" view to our Left sidebar.
Now, let’s learn how to configure and to give permission to our blocks.
First, we need to know which Block Regions do what.
At the top, there is a Demonstrate Block Regions. Click on it.
Every theme in Drupal gives us this kind of a picture of where the Block Regions are.
Block Regions are dependent on the themes.
In Bartik, we have the options:
Secondary Menu,  Header,
Primary Menu,  Highlighted, Featured top, Breadcrumb, Sidebar first, Content
Sidebar second.
We can place any block in any region.
The important ones like the Content block should be left in the Content region.
Let us click on Exit.
Leave the Breadcrumbs block in the Breadcrumb region.
But, there are some other things we can move around.
Move the Search block by either- clicking and dragging it or
clicking on the drop down and putting it in the Header. And, it moves up.
Similarly, move the "Welcome to Drupalville" to the top of Sidebar first.
Save the changes by clicking on the Save button.
Now, let’s go to the Homepage to see the changes.
Here’s our search bar, up in the header.
And our "Welcome to Drupalville" block is now at the very top.
So, that’s how we position and order blocks.
Now, we will move to configurations and permissions of Blocks.
And, let’s find our Recent Events Added block.
Right now, it’s in Sidebar first and it’s visible on every page.
Click on Configure.
Right now, Recent Events Added block is visible everywhere.
But we may want it to show up only on an event page.
Put a check-mark in Events and click Save Block.
Once again, scroll down and click Save Block button again.
Click Back to site.
Now, the Recent Events Added block is not there anymore.
But, if we go to an event, we can see Recent Events Added.
Now, up here, under the "Welcome to Drupalville" block, we see the welcome message
Let’s hide that.
Just click on the little pencil here and choose Configure block.
One of the great things about Drupal is, we can edit the front end using the pencil or the gear.
Instead of restricting by Content type, let’s restrict it by an individual page.
See here, ’Specify pages by using their paths..’.
To hide or show something on the front page, use this angle bracket- front- angle bracket.
Copy and paste it. Now choose "Show for the listed page".
Our welcome block will be only on the Homepage.
Let’s go one step further.
Click on Roles and put a check-mark in Anonymous user.
And click on Save block.
Now, it’s only going to show up when we’re not logged in.
We don’t see this message because we are logged in right now.
Let’s logout and our 'Welcome to Drupalville' block shows up again.
But when we login, and click on Home, it’s no longer there.
So, configuring, moving, and giving permissions to Blocks is really quite simple.
Let’s practice this more.
Click on Structure and then on Blocks.
We have the Main navigation in the Primary menu block.
If we move that, then our Main navigation will be in a completely different place.
Down here, at the bottom, we have: Featured bottom first, second and third
Footer first, second, third, fourth and fifth
Powered by Drupal and Footer menu in the Footer fifth location.
Right now, there are no disabled blocks.
Let’s put one of our menus in the Footer first block region.
Scroll back up to the top.
Find your User account menu and put that in Footer first.
It is immediately moved down.
Now, click on Save blocks.
Back to the site.
Scroll down and see that the user account, instead of being at the top, is down here in the footer.
So, any block can be placed anywhere, for any purpose.
Go back to Structure and Block layout.
Let’s now remove a block.
Let’s remove Powered by Drupal from the Footer fifth block.
Simply click on the drop-down and choose None. Then click on Save blocks.
Scroll down now.
We can see that Powered by Drupal block is now in the disabled block region.
Click on Back to site to see that it’s totally gone.
With this, we come to an end of this tutorial.

Structure and Validation of PAN card
Need for a PAN card  and
To know your PAN card.
PAN stands for Permanent Account Number .
This is how a PAN Card looks like.
It is a ten digit alphanumeric combination issued to all juristic entities.
It is issued by the Indian Income Tax Department.
The most important purpose of allotting PAN card is:
For the purpose of identification and
To track all the monetary information of that entity.
Facts about pan card:
PAN is unique, national and permanent.
It is unaffected by the change of address.
It is illegal to own more than one PAN.
Who all can get a PAN card?
Person
Company
HUF i.e Hindu Un-divided Family
Trust and many other bodies.
Why do we need a PAN card?
PAN card  acts as an important photo-ID proof.
PAN card helps in transactions like opening a bank account,
buying or selling of assets etc.
Pan Card is used for accounting purposes on receivable, taxable salary.
Aids in filing of Income Tax Returns .
Used as a documentary proof for opening DEMAT Account for share trading.
It is used as a documentary proof for bank withdrawals exceeding  Rs.50,000.
It is a tool that helps the IT Dept to keep a check over tax defaulters.
This is done by indirectly tracking their credit history.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to add a Push Button to a form.
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to add a list box form control to a form.
Now in this tutorial, we will learn how to add push buttons to a form.
and open our 'Library' database. You probably know how to open an existing database by now.
Click Open under the File menu and choose Library database.
Now we are in the Library database.
Let us open the 'Books Issued to Members' form that we were working with, in the last tutorial.
To do this, let us click on the Forms icon on the left panel
and then right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel.
Now click on Edit.
We are now in the Form Design window.
Before we talk about adding Push buttons to our form, let us make some way for the second list box for Member names.
Remember, we had an assignment of creating the second list box in the previous tutorial.
First, let us remove the text-box that is on the right of the Member Name label
by right-clicking on this text-box and then clicking on Cut.
The text-box is deleted.
Next, let us arrange the form elements.
Since list-boxes need more space than text-boxes, we will push the form elements further down on the form.
Here is how we will do it.
First let us select all the form elements that are below the Book title label.
For this, we will use the click, drag and drop method.
Next, let us click on the selected area and drag it vertically down
so that there is enough room for the first list-box that is adjacent to the Book Title label.
Now, let us repeat the same step for the Member Name label as well.
Now, let us click, drag and drop the second list box, that is to the left of the Member Name label
and move to its right so that it is aligned with the rest of the form controls nicely.
Okay, let us save our work on the form so far by using the keyboard shortcut Control, S.
Now, we are ready to add 'Push buttons' to our form.
A push button is another example of a form control.
We are familiar with OK, Cancel, Next and Finish buttons; these are some examples of Push buttons.
With Base, we can add these Push buttons to our form and instruct Base, to perform specific actions when clicked.
Again, Save or Undo or Delete are some examples.
Let us see how.
Let us now add four push buttons to our form, below all the other form elements, just as in the image shown here.
To do this, let us go back to our Form Design window.
And, click once on the Push button icon in the Form Controls toolbar.
This icon looks like a button with the word OK on it.
Notice that the mouse pointer looks like a plus symbol.
Now, let us draw our first button on the bottom left, by clicking, dragging and dropping on the form, below all the other elements.
And, we will resize it accordingly.
Now let us repeat the above step three more times.
And now, we have three more buttons, all aligned in one horizontal line.
We are done drawing the push buttons on the form; now let us change their labels.
To do this, double-click on the first button.
We now see the Properties window. Here, let us type 'Save Record' against the 'Label'.
Now, let us click on the second button on the form.
And in the 'Properties window', we will type 'Undo Changes' against the Label.
For the third and the fourth buttons, let us type 'Delete Record'
and 'New Record' respectively.
Now, let us define their actions.
To do this, let us click on 'Save Record' button
and in the 'Properties window', let us scroll down until we spot the 'Action' label.
Here, we will click on the drop-down list box and click on the Save record.
Let us follow the same steps for the other three buttons.
For the Undo Changes button, we will choose the Undo data entry Action.
For the Delete Record button, we will choose the Delete Record Action.
And for the New Record button, we will choose the New record Action.
So, now we have added the push buttons.
Okay, let us save our form by using the keyboard shortcut Control, S and close this window.
In the next tutorial, we will go through just three more simple modifications to our form
and then we can use the form for data entry and data updates.
For example, when a Library member returns a book, we can update this information in the database using this form.
Add a fifth push button to the form beside the fourth and when used, it should refresh the form.
And add 4 narrow push buttons in the next line below. These buttons should  help us navigate through the records.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on 'LibreOffice Base'.
To summarize, we learned how to: Add a Push Button to a form.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Configuration Management in Admin Interface.
In this tutorial, we will  learn about some menu items, such as-
Extend,  Configuration,
People and
Report.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System Drupal 8 and Firefox web browser.
As we mentioned earlier, Drupal is like a framework. So, it doesn’t actually do a lot.
This Extend link on the Administration toolbar is very important when we begin to build our site.
Click on Extend. This gives us an overview of all of the Modules on our site.
Modules are features.
We will cover them in detail later on.
This is the list of some of the Modules that come with Drupal.
We can see what has been enabled or not enabled, just by looking at the check marks.
The Extend menu allows us to see all the Modules or features that we have enabled on our Drupal site.
We will be adding a number of Modules to our site as we go, throughout this series.
Let’s look at the Configuration menu now. Only site administrators get access to this area.
Because we are the superuser or the user number 1, we have access to everything.
Notice that there’s a red pop-up on the screen.
You may or may not have this on your screen.
It says that the status report hasn’t run and that I need to check if my Drupal site is up to date.
I’m going to ignore that for now and worry about that when we get to the Reports screen.
This particular menu gives us access to configuring all the different aspects of our site,
like -  Site information, Account settings, Text formats and editors, Performance issues, Maintenance mode, Image styles and others.
We will go through these in detail later on in this series.
But for now, let us update our site information.
Click on Site information. And let’s change our Site name to "Drupalville" and in the Slogan, type: "A Great Place to Learn All About Drupal".
Whenever we make changes like this, they change the entire site.
This is one of the great things about content management systems.
So now,  whether we had one page or a thousand pages on our site, the site name across the top of every single page will be "Drupalville".
That is a really big improvement over static HTML.
Also, on this page, we get the Email address which is the 'From' address in automated emails.
We can also choose a different front page and a default 403 and 404 page.
Recall that in Drupal, every page is a web form.
So, every time we make a change on our Drupal page, we have to click Submit or Save.
Let’s click on the  Save configuration button at the bottom.
Then, click on Back to site.
Notice that our site name is now "Drupalville" and we have a slogan on every page of our site.
We will explore the Configuration menu, in detail, in later tutorials.
Let’s click People on the Administration toolbar.
It takes us to the People area on our Drupal site.
You’ll notice the tabs- List, Permissions and Roles.
This is just an introduction; we’ll cover these in much more detail, later.
The Roles section allows us to  create user accounts,  manage permissions about what people can see and  what people can do on our site.
The username "admin" is here.
If we click Edit, we can see all the things about our own user account.
We can change the Password, provided we know the current one.
There is an option to reset it, if we don’t know. Here, it tells us that our Role is Administrator.
My status is Active and we have our own Personal contact form and our LOCATION SETTINGS.
We can update and add our own picture by clicking on the Browse button, under Picture.
So, basically, this is where we can manage our own profile. Now, click on Save.
To summarize -  Roles tab allows us to add various roles.
Permissions tab allows us to give certain permissions to those roles
and, List tab allows us to assign users to those roles.
They’ll get certain Permissions which will allow them  to do certain things  and see certain things on our Drupal site.
People is where we can manage all the users on our Drupal website.
The last thing we  look at, on our Administration toolbar, is Reports.
Click on Reports.
This gives us a listing of some important things that we need to know about our Drupal site.
For example - Are there any Available updates?
Recent log messages,
A listing of all the fields on all entity types,
Status reports,Top “access denied” and   "Page not found” errors,
Top search phrases  and some of the plugins that our Views may use.
Click on Available updates. This will give us a listing of all the things that might need to be updated.
We can also see that the last update was 48 minutes ago.
This is managed by Cron and we need to set this up on our server.
For now, just click on Check manually.
Drupal will now check all the things that we have installed and let us know that we are up-to-date.
If we had added more Modules or features to our site, there would be a bigger list here.
We will check this again later on, as we go through this tutorial.
Click on Reports to get a Status report of our site.
For example, what version of Drupal we have and when Cron was last run.
Here we can see a link from where we can run Cron externally.
Our Database system, Database version etc.
You should keep a close look on the Reports section of your site,
especially, if you’re the person responsible for maintaining all the updates for Drupal  and the Modules that you download.
Lastly, we have Help and Help gives us links to Help page of our site.
That sums up our Administration Toolbar.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about menu items:Extend Configuration People and Report.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Convex Lenses.
At the end of this tutorial you will be able to,
Change the object distance and object height and see the kind of image formed.
Calculate the magnification and length of the telescope tube.
Here I am using,
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For prerequisite tutorials please visit this site.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
Right-click on imageconverginglens_en.htm file.
Image Formation by Converging Lenses App opens in the browser.
The App shows a ray diagram of the convex lens.
Before moving to the App let us first be familiar with a ray diagram.
Let us define principal axis.
It is an imaginary line passing through the optical center.
A vertical axis divides the lens into two equal halves.
There are four positions on the principal axis.
These positions are 2F, F , F prime and 2 F prime
F is the focal length and 2F is twice the distance of focal length.
F prime and 2F prime are on the opposite side of the lens with the same distance as F and 2F.
Now let us open the App.
Let us use the scale to spot the positions of focal length F and 2F.
Initially the object is placed at the zero position of the scale.
The distance of the object from the lens is 50 cm.
The vertical black line beyond the lens is a screen.
This screen can be moved back and forth.
Blue arrow indicates the height of the object.
2F is twice the distance of the focal length F.
From the App, the focal length is 10 cm, so position of 2F has to be at 20 cm.
Green arrow indicates the image formed by the convex lens.
In the green control panel we can edit the values of the following parameters.
Change the value of Focal length to 20 cm and press Enter.
At the bottom of the green panel, there are two radio buttons.
Principal light rays and Bundle of light rays.
By default Principal light rays option is selected.
A drop-down is provided to Emphasize different parameters.
From the drop-down list, select Object distance.
Observe that the App emphasizes the object distance using a blinking line.
The blinking line disappears after sometime.
We can also change the object distance by dragging the object.
As we drag, the value in the text-box changes accordingly.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to refresh the App.
Now change the value of Object height to 15 cm.
Change the Focal length to 20 cm.
Let us learn about the ray diagram.
The ray emerging from the object is parallel to the principal axis of the lens.
This ray after refraction passes through the second principal focus F’.
A second ray of light passes through the optical center of the lens.
This ray after refraction emerges without any deviation.
A third ray passes through the first principal focus.
This ray, after refraction, is parallel to the principal axis.
The image is formed at point of intersection of the three rays.
Let us change the position of the object and see where the image appears.
Change the Object distance to 40 cm and Object height to 10 cm.
The Kind of image  is real, inverted and equal dimension.
This is the condition for 2F.
When object is at 2F the image will appear at 2F’.
Here the object distance and height will be equal to image distance and image height.
Drag the object between the 2F and F.
Drag the object to 10 cm.
Here we can use the scale to take the measurement.
Observe that the image is formed beyond 2F’.
The image formed is real, inverted and magnified.
Drag the object between F and optic center.
Drag the object to 30 cm.
Observe that image is formed at the first principal focus behind the object.
Here the image formed is virtual, upright, and magnified.
As an assignment
What characteristics of the image do you observe?
Let us move to next App.
To open the App right-click on refractor_en.htm file.
Select the option Open with Firefox Web Browser.
The App opens with Refracting Astronomical Telescope.
Before moving to the simulation, please read the information given on the screen.
Scroll down the screen.
In the yellow panel, the bigger lens is the objective.
The objective has a large focal length.
Here the smaller lens is an Eyepiece.
The red coloured rays indicate the light from a distant object.
Light rays from a distant object enter the objective lens.
After refraction a real image is formed at the second focal point.
Then the eyepiece magnifies the image. The image formed is enlarged and inverted.
The magnified image of six brightest star of the pleiades is seen in the black circle.
In the green panel, Focal lengths of Objective and Eyepiece can be edited.
Here we can vary the Focal lengths of Objective and Eyepiece from 0.05 m to 0.5 m.
As per the changes in the Focal lengths, App calculates Angles and Magnification.
At the bottom of the screen, App has given the formula for magnification.
That is: v= - f
Here v is the Magnification
f
Let us calculate the magnification using the formula.
Change the Focal length of Objective to 0.45 m and Eyepiece to 0.1 m.
Observe that App has calculated the value for Magnification.
Notice the changes in the black circle.
If we increase the focal length of the Objective, image will be more magnified.
Let us now calculate the length of the telescope tube.
Change the Focal lengths of the Objective and Eyepiece to their default values.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to restart the App.
Formula to calculate the length of the telescope tube is sum of the Focal lengths of Objective and Eyepiece.
That is: L= f
Here f1 is focal length of Objective and f2 is focal length of Eyepiece.
Substitute the Focal lengths and calculate the length of the telescope tube.
Observe that the length of the telescope is 0.6 m.
Now reverse the Focal lengths of the Objective and Eyepiece.
Observe that the six brightest stars of pleiades appears to be a single point.
This is because the focal length of the Objective is smaller than that of the Eyepiece.
As an assignment solve this numerical.
Let us summarise.
Using these Apps we have,
Changed the object distance and object height and seen the kind of image formed.
Calculated the magnification and length of the telescope tube.
These Apps are created by Walter-fendt and his team.

This is Himanshi Karwanje from IIT-Bombay.
Hello friends. On behalf of CDEEP, IIT Bombay, I welcome you to this Spoken Tutorial.
This tutorial will explain how to dub a spoken tutorial or a movie clip from one language into another through a step-by-step process.
All you need is a headset with an audio input or a stand-alone microphone and speakers which can be attached to your computer.
Windows Movie Maker, a component of Microsoft Windows, is an editing software that is available for all the latest Windows versions – Me, XP or Vista.
If you do not have it on your computer, you can download it free of cost from the site: 'www.microsoft.com/downloads'.
Double-click on the Windows Movie Maker icon to run it. This will open an empty Movie project on your screen.
There are several options in this panel. The first option is Capture Video. Under this option, you will see the Import Video sub-option. Click on it.
This will open the 'Import Video' dialog-box. Go to the location where the 'file-to-be-dubbed.wmv' is present.
The video is being imported into 'Windows Movie Maker'.
Select all of them by pressing Ctrl+A. Now, right-click on the clips and choose Add to Timeline option. The video clips will be added to the Timeline here.
Click on the 'PLUS' button next to Video. You will be able to view the 'Audio Timeline' now.
All the audio clips will be selected. Now, go to the Main Menu. Choose Clip, Audio and Mute.
Notice the frame-head which indicates the current position on the timeline.
Next, click on Tools in the Main Menu and choose Narrate Timeline sub-option.
When choosing the Input level, select a level towards the upper portion of the meter without entering the red-colored area which is marked by the second line from the top.
If the capturing level is set too low, the captured audio may not be heard.
Now click on the Start Narration button to begin capturing the audio narration to your computer.
I’ll set the input level to this mark and move the frame-head to this position because this is from where the narration in the original video begins. Now, I will click on Start Narration.
“Doston, CDEEP, IIT Bombay ki taraf se, main iss tutorial mein aap ka swagat karti hoon.
I will stop capturing the narration by clicking on the Stop Narration button.
Movie Maker will ask you to save the narration as an audio file on your computer.
I will choose this folder and give this name. Click on Save.
Once you have saved the audio file, you will find that the recorded audio clip appears in the Audio timeline.
Now is a good time to talk about saving the entire work as a project.
When you do it the first time, you will be prompted for a file name.
Click on Save. All future Ctrl + S will automatically save into this project file.
You can exit from 'Movie Maker' after saving into the project file and resume dubbing at any future convenient time.
Just click on File > Open Project and choose the project you want to open.
Ensure that the frame head is positioned at the point from where you want to continue and start dubbing once again as you did before.
Remember to save the project often during the dubbing.
Once the narration for the entire spoken tutorial is complete, you should create a movie.
Go to Finish Movie. Choose the first option - Save to my computer. Click on it.
Enter the file name for your dubbed movie and specify the path.
“Hindi_Dub_file.” Click on the Next button. Here, you can choose the output file quality.
Let me explain this in detail.
Choosing “Best fit to file size” will give a lower quality video but with a smaller file size.
Choosing “Other settings” will display all the saving options available in which the resultant video can be saved.
So, depending on how you are going to view or where you are going to upload the video, you will have to choose the appropriate quality option.
I’m going to choose Best fit to file size and 30MB.
As the file to be dubbed is also of this dimension and as I want the dubbed movie to have the same dimensions, I will choose this option.
If this is not a requirement, you may choose a number smaller than 30MB. For e.g.- 25 MB.
I will go back and change this to 30 MB and click on NEXT.
Click on Finish. And exit 'Windows Movie Maker'.
So, you see, by following this procedure you will be able to create dubbed versions of any spoken tutorial or movie clip in a few simple steps.
Hope you find this information helpful.

Hello Everyone.
In this tutorial, we will learn to edit an audio track in Audacity.
To record this tutorial I am using
To practise this tutorial, learners should
Have working knowledge of Audacity software
If not, for more details, refer to the Translation and Dubbing series on this website
I will use this timed-script for editing purpose.
To practise alongside, the same script has been provided in the Code Files link of this tutorial.
Now let us open an existing Audacity project file to edit the audio.
Earlier, we had dubbed an audio and saved it as Hindi-What-is-ST.aup on our machine.
Now, go to the saved folder and double-click on Hindi-What-is-ST.aup to open the file.
The .aup file opens up.
We can see the audio track here.
Before proceeding further, it is advisable to make a copy of the project file.
In case of any major editing mistake, we can always use the original audio recording.
To make a copy, click on File and then on Save Project As option.
I will give a name as Copy-Hindi-What-is-ST.aup.
Select the location.
Now, we have a copy of the original recording.
We will continue with this project file.
First let us learn how to Zoom In and Zoom Out.
Place the cursor on the audio track.
On the Edit Toolbar click on Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons.
We can see how the audio track gets zoomed in and zoomed out.
Next, let us learn how to filter out disturbing background noises.
Select the portion on the audio track which has the noise.
Now in the Main Menu, click on Effect and then on Noise Removal/Noise Reduction.
Step 1: Click on Get Noise Profile.
Then click anywhere on the timeline to deselect the portion.
Once again, in the Main Menu, click on Effect and then on Noise Removal/Noise Reduction.
Now in Step 2: Change the value in the field Noise reduction.
Use the recommended value or a lower value, that reduces the noise to an acceptable level.
I will choose an appropriate value say 18.
Higher values will remove the noise completely.
However, it will also result in distortion of the voice in the audio track.
Hisses and hums will become more prominent, as well.
Make sure that, in the Noise section, Reduce/Remove radio button is selected.
It may take some time to remove the noise, if the audio track is very long.
Now, let us play the recording by clicking on the Play button.
Add the audio
The noise is now removed from the entire track.
Note: In some cases, you may have to repeat the process to further reduce the noise.
However, too much of noise reduction, may give a metallic effect to the recorded voice.
Let us now save the project file by pressing Ctrl + S keys.
Do so regularly as we go along.
It is advisable to save the project file whenever we have done any modification.
Let us now increase the volume of the audio segment that has been recorded at a lower volume.
Select the portion in the audio track, then go to Effect and then on Amplify.
We can see a value in the Amplification box.
This is the optimal amplification value for this file, recommended by Audacity.
To reduce the volume, enter negative values, say -10.
To increase the volume, enter positive values, say 15.
It is advisable not to amplify the audio above the recommended value in the box.
Too much of amplification will also enhance the background noises, hisses and hums.
We can also use the slider to adjust the values.
Check the Allow Clipping option.
Sometimes, an audio file contains unwanted repeats and unwanted sounds.
We can remove these by using the Cut, Copy and Paste options.
First, I will split this audio clip as per my Timed script timings.
Let me play the audio. Press the Play button in the VCR controls.
Add the audio
I have stopped at the end of the first sentence, by pressing the Stop button in the VCR controls.
I need to split the audio here.
For that, click on the Selection Tool.
Now press Ctrl+I, which is the shortcut to split the audio track into separate clips.
Then, slide the next clip to the timing that we want.
I will slide it to the timing given in my Timed script.
For this, click on Time Shift Tool.
Observe that the cursor is now changed to double-headed arrow.
I will shift the clip by pressing the left mouse button and dragging it to the required time.
I will repeat this process once again for the next sentence.
Add tha audio
I have stopped the audio by pressing the Stop button.
I will split the audio here. For that, click on the Selection Tool.
Make sure that the cursor is at the end of the second sentence.
Now I will press CTRL+I to split the audio.
Ensure that the Time Shift Tool is selected.
Press the left mouse button and drag it to the required time.
Likewise, we can split and slide the remaining segment of the audio, as per the requirement.
Notice that there are 4 individual audio segments, at their respective timings on the audio track.
Save the file before moving ahead by pressing Ctrl + S.
Now let us learn to cut, copy and paste on the Audio Track.
Ensure that Selection Tool is selected.
Then click on the Audio track at the beginning of the third sentence
Play the audio.
Add the Audio file
I have clicked on the Stop button to stop playing the audio.
We can see that the third sentence ends here.
But it has some unwanted sounds and repetitions which we need to delete.
Select the portion of the audio that needs to be deleted, by dragging the mouse.
Then press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Note that when you do this the remaining audio segments move forward on the audio track.
Now let us learn to move an audio clip from one place to another place on the audio track.
Select the audio clip that needs to be moved.
In the Main menu, click on Edit and then click on Remove Audio or Special and then select Cut.
Note that when you do this, the remaining audio segments move forward on the audio track.
And, we need to re-arrange the timing of the remaining audio segments all over again.
What if we don’t want to change the timings of the remaining segments?
First, undo the last action by pressing CTRL+Z keys.
Then again select the audio clip once that needs to be removed.
Now, press Ctrl + Alt + X keys on your keyboard.
This will not only cut the audio segment but also keep the remaining segments in their place.
Please note the difference between the two actions.
Next, select a portion of an audio segment to be copied.
I will select a portion here and click on Edit and Copy.
To paste, move the cursor to the place where the audio segment needs to be placed and click there once.
Then click on Edit and Paste.
Notice here - the 2 segments appear to be merged.
Merge the two segments by clicking on the joint between the 2 segments.
Now you can move the whole segment wherever you want.
Let me zoom out here to view the whole audio segments.
Observe that if I try to move this audio clip to the beginning of this track, I am not allowed to do so.
This is because there is no sufficient space available there to accommodate this clip.
Now, let us try the first audio segment.
Drag the 1st audio segment and move it to the end of the fourth audio segment.
After creating space, we are able to move the second segment to the beginning of the track.
So the standard rule is to first create sufficient space on the track and then move the segments.
Undo the last action by pressing CTRL + Z keys.
Once all the edits are complete, save the project file once again.
Lastly, we need to Export the final project into a format suitable for playback.
Let us export this file into mp3 format.
For this, go to the Main menu bar. Click on File and then on Export.
The Export file dialog box appears.
I will name the file as Hindi-What-is-ST.
Also select the location where it has to be saved.
Below this, we can see a drop-down called file type or Format.
It has various audio formats like wav, mp3, ogg, etc.
I will choose MP3 files as the format.
Then click on Save.
Next we will get a dialog called Edit Metadata.
Here, we can add the Artist Name and other information as per our requirement.
Click on OK.
This may take some time to complete.
Now, go to the folder where we saved the file.
Let us play this file using any standard audio player.
Add the Audio file
Let me summarize the tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learnt how to-
Zoom in and out on the audio track
Amplify the audio
Merge two audio clips
As an assignment, edit an audio file using the timed-script.

Welcome to this tutorial on Functions in R
In this tutorial, we will learn: Need for functions
How to create a user-defined function
Scope of variables
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Basics of permutation and combination
Basic data structures
Conditional statements
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A script file myFunctions.R.
Please download this file from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved this file to functions folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set functions folder as my Working Directory.
A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task.
R has a large number of built-in functions.
In spite of that, sometimes we need to define our own functions.
User-defined functions are specific to user’s requirements.
Once created these functions can be used as the built-in functions.
An R function is created by using the keyword function.
The syntax of an R function is as follows:
The different parts of a function are: Name, Arguments, Body, Return value.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myFunctions.R in RStudio.
Here, we have declared a sample vector named sampleVec.
Let us find the summary of this vector by using the built-in function.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run this script by clicking on the Source button.
The summary of sampleVec is displayed.
It includes median, mean, etc.
Similarly, R has many built-in functions to make our life easy.
But we can always create a function of our own, depending on the need.
We will create a function that computes the permutation of two numbers.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have named our function as permutation.
Next, we have passed two values as arguments.
Inside the function, the definition of permutation has been written.
Run the current line by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
Now, let us test this function to check whether it gives correct results.
First, we will calculate the permutation of 5 and 2.
In the Source window, type permutation and in parentheses 5 comma 2.
Run the current line.
The required value of 20 is displayed.
Thus, our function has given the correct result.
While creating functions, the arguments are optional.
Let us create a function that does not take any arguments.
We will create a function named as votingEligibility.
In the Source window, type the following commands.
This function should print a message whether an Indian citizen is eligible to vote or not.
Remember the minimum age for Indian citizens to vote is 18 years.
Here, we have not passed any arguments.
readline function reads a line from the terminal in interactive use.
Run this block of code to execute the function votingEligibility.
Now, we will run this function to see whether it works.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Please note that we are not passing any arguments inside this function.
Run the current line.
We are asked to enter our age.
Let us type 21 and press Enter.
We get a message, You can cast your vote.
Now let us say we want to create a function sum_between_two such that
it takes two natural numbers num1 and num2 as its arguments.
Then, it returns the sum of all numbers from num1 to num2.
For example, if we pass 2 and 6 to the function sum_between_two,
it should return the value of 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
Let us switch back to RStudio.
In the Source window, type the following command.
We have named our function as sum_between_two.
Also, we have specified the two arguments num1 and num2.
Inside the function, we have initialized an object named result to store the sum.
We have created a for loop which will increment the result at each iteration.
Run this block of code to execute the function.
Now we test our function sum_between_two by running it with two arguments.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the current line.
The function with arguments 2 and 6 was executed, but we got nothing as output.
Let us investigate what went wrong.
We know that our function got executed as we did not get any error after executing this line.
It means that the object named result  got incremented.
Now, we will check the value of the result.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the current line.
It shows, Error in print(result) : object 'result' not found.
To understand what went wrong, we need to learn a concept named as Scope.
Scope is the term used to describe how objects and variables get defined within R.
If a variable is defined inside a function, then it can be accessed inside the function only.
So, if we try to access the same variable outside the function, it will throw an error.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Here, the variable result is defined inside the function.
So its scope is limited to this function only.
Hence, when we tried to access this variable outside the function, it threw an error.
For this problem, we can use return function.
Let us get back to our function sum_between_two.
Press Enter at the end of for loop.
Now type the following command.
I will resize the Console window.
Select all lines of the function sum_between_two..
Now press Ctrl + Enter keys together to run the updated function.
Let us run the function again with arguments 2 and 6.
For this, we will run this line.
We see the output 20 as expected.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt: Need for functions
How to create a user-defined function
Scope of variables
We now suggest an assignment.
Create a function which computes combination of the two numbers.
Create a function which takes a natural number as an argument, and prints Fibonacci    series
For example, consider fibonacci(5). It should print the first 5 elements of Fibonacci series, i.e. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

We are using:   Ubuntu version 12.04
Before we begin, recall that we had created  ttt directory earlier.
Then to  ruby hyphen tutorial and looping hyphen statements directories.
Now that we are in that folder, let’s move ahead.
The syntax of the while loop in  Ruby is as follows:
while “boolean expression”
ruby code , end
Let us look at an example.
Name it while hyphen loop dot rb.
I have a working example of the  'while' loop.
Now, let us switch to the terminal and type:   gedit space while hyphen loop dot rb space & (ampersand)
You can pause the tutorial, type the code as we go through it.
First, I declared a local variable 'i' and initialized it with value 0.
'i' will adopt this decremented value before the next iteration.
ruby code ,  end
Let us look at an example.
'i' will adopt this decremented value before the next iteration.
The variable 'i' gets decremented during every iteration.
Subsequently, it breaks out of the loop and stops printing the output.
You should now be able to write your own until loop in Ruby.
ruby code , redo
a conditional statement , break
end conditional
ruby code, end loop
Let us look at an example.
You can pause the tutorial and type the code as we go through this example.

Hello friends and welcome to the spoken tutorial on "loading data from files".
In this tutorial, you will learn to:
You should know how to run basic Python commands on the ipython console.
If not, for relevant Python tutorials, please visit this website.
Let us first open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously. Now, type ipython3 and press Enter.
Let us begin with reading the file primes.txt. This file contains a list of prime numbers listed in a column.
Type:  cat(space)primes(dot)txt
We can use the cat command to fetch data from the file and display it on the terminal. Press Enter.
We see the prime numbers are displayed on the terminal.
Now we can use the loadtxt() command to store this list into the variable primes.
So, type: primes(equal to)loadtxt(within parentheses)(within double quotes)primes(dot)txt and press Enter.
Please make sure that you provide the correct path to the file, 'primes.txt'.
The file, in our case, is present in the home folder.
primes is now a sequence of prime numbers that was listed in the file primes.txt.
Now let us display the contents in the variable primes.
So, type: print (within parentheses) primes and press Enter. We see the sequence printed.
We observe that all the numbers end with a period ‘.’ . This is because all these numbers are floats.
Now, type: cat(space)pendulum(dot)txt  and press Enter.
This file contains two columns of data. This first column contains the length of the pendulum.
Let us now read the data from the file into the variable pend using the loadtxt command.
So, type: pend(equal to)loadtxt(within parentheses)(within double quotes)pendulum(dot)txt and press Enter.
Please note that loadtxt needs both the columns of the file to have equal number of rows.
Now, print the variable pend to see what it contains.
Notice that the variable has two sequences containing two columns of the data file.
Let us use an additional argument of the loadtxt command to read the data into two separate sequences.
So, type L(comma)T(equal to)loadtxt(within parentheses within double quotes)pendulum(dot)txt(after double quotes comma)unpack(equal to)True
Now print the variables L and T to see what they contain.
Type:  print(within parentheses)L and press Enter.
Notice, that L and T now contain the first and second columns of data from the pendulum.txt respectively.
unpack(equal to)True has made the two columns into two separate and simple sequences.
Pause the video over here and try out the following exercise and resume the video.
Read the data from the file pendulum(underscore)semicolon(dot)txt.
This file contains data in two columns. These columns are separated by semicolons.
Let us look at the solution. Switch to the terminal.
First we will see the content of the file.
So, type: cat space pendulum(underscore)semicolon(dot)txt and press  Enter. We see the two columns separated by a semicolon.
Now, type:  L(comma)T(equal to)loadtxt (within parentheses within double quotes) pendulum(underscore)semicolon (dot)txt(after double quotes comma)unpack(equal to)True(comma)delimiter(equal to)(within double quotes)semicolon.
Now, print(within parentheses)L and press Enter.
This will display the contents inside the two variables L and T.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to read data from files using the loadtxt() command.
The data can be in:
3. Given a file data.txt with three columns of data separated by colon. Read it into 3 separate simple sequences.
Now, let us look at the answers. The answer to the first question is False.
The loadtxt() command can read data from files having single columns as well as multiple columns.
The answer to the second question is-
x(equal to)loadtxt(within parentheses and within double quotes)data(dot)txt(after double quotes comma)unpack(equal to)True.
The answer to the third question is-
So, x(equal to)loadtxt( within parentheses, within double quotes)data(dot)txt(after double quotes comma)unpack(equal to)True(comma)delimiter(equal to)(within double quotes)colon.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basic Formatting of Articles in Joomla.
We will also learn how to insert lists, insert a page break and insert Read More links  in articles.
For this tutorial, we will be using:
To follow this tutorial, you should know how to create articles in Joomla.
If not, check the relevant Joomla tutorials on the website.
Earlier, we learnt to create, edit, delete and copy an article in Joomla.
Now, let’s learn how to format articles.
Let’s switch to the Joomla control panel.
Click on Article Manager.
Here are the articles we created earlier- “Benefits of Sodium” and “Vitamin A”.
Let us view them on the Digital India web-page.
Click on Digital India at the top right of the page.
We can see both our articles here.
Click on Benefits of Sodium.
We can see the article is not formatted.
Let’s go back to the Article Manager.
Click on the article title “Benefits of Sodium”.
The editor in which we type the text of the article, is called a WYSIWYG editor.
WYSIWYG is the abbreviation of 'What You See Is What You Get'.
It means the article looks the same in the web page as seen in the editing window.
Look at the menu bar of the editor now.
The first row has drop-down menus which have various formatting options.
You can see the sub-options when you click on them.
The second row has set of formatting options.
So here, we see a set of text enhancement options like  Bold, Italics, Underline and Strikethrough.
Next, we see the options to align the text to the left, centre, right and justify.
These work as in any other text editor.
After the alignment options, we can see a button named  Paragraph.
When we click on it, we can see various options like Heading 1, Heading 2 etc.
These are pre-set options provided by Joomla for formatting purposes.
Headings are very useful in making text easier to read on the screen.
Headings also define the hierarchy of details.
Heading 1 defines the most important heading and Heading 6 is the least important.
Switch to Digital India webpage.
Here, the text Home is in Heading 1.
The title of an article in Joomla is in Heading 2.
Other headings, like Main Menu and Login Form are in Heading 3.
Notice that the font size keeps decreasing with levels of headings.
Switch to the Edit Article webpage.
Let us add one section on food sources of Sodium.
At the end of the article text, click Enter to begin a new paragraph.
Type Food Sources: as the heading.
We will type 3 food sources here – Salt, Processed Food and Canned Food.
Select the text Food Sources: and in the Paragraph drop-down, select Heading 4.
Switch to the Digital India webpage and refresh the page.
Notice that the text Food Sources appears in bold.
Go back to Edit Article webpage.
Next to the heading Food Sources, add the text - Let’s look at some food sources of sodium.
Here, we have added the text in the same paragraph.
The newly added text becomes part of the heading and is formatted as Heading 4.
Please note that the header formatting applies to the entire paragraph and not to particular words.
To separate this line from the heading, press Enter before the newly added text.
Then select the text and from the Paragraph drop-down, select the option Paragraph.
The text is no longer in Heading 4 format.
Let me add a text line at the top of the page: “Chemical Symbol of Sodium is Na.”
Select the text line and then from the Paragraph drop-down button, select Pre.
The Pre option is for preformatted text.
Preformatted text is displayed in fixed wide font, and preserves both spaces and line breaks.
Go to the Digital India webpage and refresh it.
Notice that the newly added text appears in a grey box.
It also appears in a different font and style.
Pre style is usually used for text that needs to stand out in an article. This could be poetic stanza, computer code, quotes etc.
Switch to the Edit Article webpage again.
Next, we have the bulleted list and numbered list options.
Let us see how to use them.
Select the last 3 line items in the article text.
Now, click on bullet list icon and then click on Save button.
Refresh the Website to see the bulleted list in the article Benefits of Sodium.
Come back to the Edit Article webpage.
The third row has some advanced formatting options like: Decrease and increase indent, Un-do and Redo, Insert links, images, tables etc., Subscript, superscript  and special characters.
You can try these on your own and see how they work.
Let’s look at our article again.
Here we have 2 sections: text about introduction of sodium and its benefits and Food Sources.
Let’s separate these two sections using a horizontal line.
Keep the cursor before the text Food Sources.
Now click on the Horizontal Line icon in the formatting tool bar.
This will insert a horizontal line.
Save and refresh the Digital India web-page.
We can see the changes in the article “Benefits of Sodium”.
Instead of inserting a horizontal line, why not put these 2 sections in 2 different pages? Let’s try doing that.
Go back to the Edit Article webpage.
First we will remove the horizontal line.
So, click on it and then press the Backspace key on the keyboard.
Now, place the cursor at the point where we want to insert the Page Break.
Scroll down and locate the Page Break button at the bottom of the editor window. Click on it.
It will open an Insert Pagebreak dialog-box.
Enter Sources as Page Title and Food Sources of Sodium as Table of Contents Alias.
Click on Insert Page Break button.
You will see a zig-zag line between the two sections.
Switch to the Digital India web-page and refresh it.
This page says Page 1 of 2.
There are Prev and Next buttons below the article text.
A new block has appeared on the right.
It helps us navigate to the various pages of the particular article.
The title of the 2nd page is the Table of Contents Alias we typed earlier.. i.e. Food Sources of Sodium.
Now, the page says Page 2 of 2.
Notice the Page Title that we typed in the Insert Pagebreak field.
It has been appended to the title of the article.
Now, let’s click on the Digital India link to go back to our website’s Homepage.
Scroll down to see the article Benefits of Sodium.
Notice here that the full article text is displayed on the Homepage.
Let us explore how to add a Read More option here.
This option will show only a part of the article on the Homepage.
For this article, I’ll insert a Read More link before the text: Daily consumption of sodium, however, depends on a number of factors.
Go back to the Edit Article webpage.
Place the cursor at the point where you want to insert the Read More link.
Now, at the bottom, click on the Read More button next to the Page Break button.
Scroll up and click on the Save button.
Switch to the  webpage and refresh it.
We can see the Read More link below the article text here.
When we click on it, the article Benefits of Sodium opens.
And it will display the full article in 2 pages, just as we had set it earlier.
Let us summarise. In this tutorial, we learnt about:
We also learnt how to insert Lists, insert Page Break and insert Read More links in articles.
Remove the Read More link and put it just before Food Sources.
Add the text Melting Point 97.72 °C as pre-formatted text along with the current pre-formatted text.
Hint is, to use special characters to get the text °C in the article.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Packages.
how to reference classes in a package,
how to import a package and
To record this tutorial, I am using :  OpenModelica 1.9.2 and Ubuntu Operating System version 14.04 and gedit.
Windows users may use Notepad or any other text-editor instead of gedit.
To understand and practice this tutorial, you need Knowledge of class and type definition in Modelica
Prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website. Please go through them.
A Package is a specialized class in Modelica.
It is a collection of classes.
It can be stored as a single file or a directory.
We will first learn about single file storage.
In single file storage, all classes belonging to a package are written in a single file.
It is not recommended as it may get lengthy in a few cases.
Now, let me switch to OMEdit to demonstrate single file storage for a package.
Please download and save all the files available on our website.
You may see that there is a file and a folder bearing the name spokenTutorialExamples.
Please download both of them.
Now, let me open the necessary files in OMEdit.
Press Ctrl + O.
Go to the appropriate location on your system and select   spokenTutorialExamples.mo,
bouncingBallWithUserTypes.mo and  bouncingBallWithImport.
You may also open each of them individually.
Note that I have not selected spokenTutorialExamples folder.
We shall discuss more about it when we look at directory storage.
Click on Open.
You may see that spokenTutorialExamples package is now seen in Libraries Browser.
Double-click on spokenTutorialExamples icon.
Switch to Text View if the file opens in Icon/Diagram View.
Now, let me discuss spokenTutorialExamples.
First line defines the name of a package.
Evidently, name of this package is spokenTutorialExamples.
This package consists of freefall class, bouncingBall model and bouncingBallWithUserTypes models.
end statement defines where the package ends.
We have viewed all classes and models of this package at one place.
Now, let us learn how to view individual classes in a package.
Click on the plus (+) button besides spokenTutorialExamples icon, in Libraries Browser.
This displays the names of classes present in this package.
Double-click on freeFall in Libraries Browser.
freeFall class has now opened.
Individual classes of a package may be simulated.
But the package itself can not be simulated.
Let me go back to spokenTutorialExamples tab.
Note that Simulate button doesn’t appear in the toolbar which indicates that this package cannot be simulated.
Now let me unload spokenTutorialExamples from OMEdit.
Do a right-click and select unload. Select Yes.
This is done so as to avoid conflict when demonstrating directory storage.
Now let me go back to the slides.
In Directory storage, classes are stored in separate files.
Name of directory is same as that of the package.
A file named package.mo is to be included in the directory and  each class starts with a within statement.
Now, let me demonstrate the folder spokenTutorialExamples that you’ve downloaded.
Note that this folder represents the same package as that we have already discussed.
Let me demonstrate the file structure of this folder.
Go to the location where you saved the downloaded files on your system.
Double-click on spokenTutorialExamples folder.
Notice that the folder has following files: package.mo,  freeFall.mo, bouncingBallWithUserTypes and  bouncingBall.
We shall understand more about directory storage using both OMEdit and gedit.
Note that package.mo indicates that this folder represents a package.
Without this file, the folder doesn’t represent a Modelica package.
Now, let me switch to OMEdit to demonstrate directory storage.
Press Ctrl + O.
Navigate to the spokenTutorialExamples folder that you have downloaded.
Select package.mo from this folder and click on Open.
spokenTutorialExamples package can now be seen in Libraries Browser.
Double-click on spokenTutorialExamples icon.
Open the package in Text View  if it opens in either Icon/Diagram View.
If you scroll down, you may notice that this package is the same as that we have seen in single file storage.
The difference between single file and directory storage can only be understood when we open this package using a text editor like gedit.
You may use Notepad or any other text editor if you are using Windows.
Now, let me unload spokenTutorialExamples package from 'OMEdit.
Switch to spokenTutorialExamples folder and open all the files using gedit.
Now all the files are open in gedit.
Let us take a look at package.mo first.
within statement indicates that this file represents a package.
Name of this package is spokenTutorialExamples.
Note that the name of folder was spokenTutorialExamples  as well.
package.mo file can only contain the within statement and package declaration.
Let me switch to freeFall tab.
This within statement indicates that freefall class belongs to spokenTutorialExamples package.
Rest of this file has information specific to freeFall class.
You may see that other models in this package namely bouncingBallWithUserTypes and bouncingBall follow a similar syntax as well.
But, we didn’t observe within statement when we opened the package in OMEdit.
This indicates that within statement helps OMEdit recognize the file structure.
Hence, it is omitted by OMEdit while displaying the package.
We shall now understand more about Modelica Library.
Modelica Library is an open-source package.
OMEdit automatically loads it for every session.
It can be seen in Libraries Browser.
It has classes from mechanical, electrical and thermal domains.
Classes of this library can be referenced and used.
Now, let me switch to OMEdit to demonstrate Modelica Library.
Locate Modelica icon in Libraries Browser and expand it.
Note that Modelica Library has packages named Blocks, Complex Blocks etc.
You may note that a package may further contain packages as well as is evident here. Of special mention is the SIunits package.
Expand it.
This package has type definitions for physical quantities like Angle, Length, Position etc.
We shall see how to use these type definitions using bouncingBallWithImport class.
Compress SIunits.
And double-click on bouncingBallWithImport and bouncingBallWithUserTypes.
We shall first look at bouncingBallWithUserTypes.
We have learnt about this model in the prerequisite tutorials.
This model has type definitions named Length and Velocity.
We can instead use the type definition in SIunits instead of defining them explicitly in every model.
We shall see how to do that using bouncingBallWithImport model.
Let me switch to bouncingBallWithImport.
A class in a package is referenced to using dot.
Modelica.SIunits refers to SIunits package which belongs to Modelica library.
Variable h is declared to be of Length type which is defined in SIunits package.
Similarly, variable v is declared to be of Velocity type which is defined in SIunits package.
Note that parameters radius and g are declared in a similar fashion.
Now let me Simulate this model.
Click on Simulate button in the toolbar.
Select h in the Variables Browser.
Note that the plot obtained is similar to the one seen in the case ofbouncingBallWithUserTypes.
Let me de-select h. Delete the result. Switch to Modeling perspective.
It is tedious to use the full name of a class every time.
This can be simplified using import statement.
Now, we shall type a few statements that show the use of import.
The statements to be typed are provided in a text file named import-statements.txt.
Go to the location where you saved it on your system.
Double-click on import-statements.txt. Windows users may use Notepad to open this file.
The file is now open in gedit.
Copy all the statements using Ctrl+C or by doing right-click.
Switch to OMEdit.
Paste all the statements at the beginning of the model.
Delete the declaration statements for Length and Velocity, which have been defined before.
Delete the extra spaces.
Save this model by pressing Ctrl + S.
Now the model is complete and ready for simulation.
Click on Simulate button to simulate it.
Select h in the Variables Browser.
Note that the plot is same as in previous case.
De-select h and delete the result.
Switch to Modeling perspective.
Now let us now try to understand the import statements.
Using the import statements, Modelica looks up for Length and Velocity type definitions using the path mentioned here.
This saves the trouble of referring to the package every time.
A detailed discussion of lookup rules is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
Now let us see how we can replace these two import statements by a single import statement. Delete the two statements.
And type: import space Modelica dot SIunits dot asterisk semicolon
Save this model by pressing Ctrl + S
This statement is known as a wild-card import.
This way, any class from SIunits may be accessed without explicitly mentioning it.
Now let me Simulate this model.
Click on Simulate button.
Close the pop- up window.
Select h in the Variables Browser.
You may notice the similarity of plot once again.
De-select h and delete the result.
Go back to Modeling perspective.
Now let me switch to the slides.
As an assignment,  declare variable h and v of freeFall class as Length and Velocity types respectively.
These type definitions can be found in SIunits package of Modelica library.

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Overview of HTML”.
In this tutorial we will learn:
The content available in various tutorials in this series.
What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
It is used to create web pages with the help of Markup tags
Markup tags will structure our content as per our requirement
It is used to publish our content on the Internet
HTML supports text, images, multimedia content, etc.
It is platform independent and hence works on all operating systems.
To work with HTML, we need-
A web browser to display the formatted content.
Throughout this series I will be using:
Firefox web browser and Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS
Now, we will briefly go through some of the individual tutorials in this series.
In this tutorial we will learn the syntax and structure of HTML.
Then we’ll see how to create an HTML file and see the output on a web browser.
In the next tutorial, we will learn about HTML elements, tags and their attributes.
The next tutorial is Formatting Tags.
In this, we’ll see how to format our content using some of the basic formatting tags in HTML.
With the help of Styles and CSS tutorial, we can add more styles and decorate our content.
The tutorial named List is next in the series.
Tables in HTML tutorial helps to display the contents in tabular structure.
Embedding Images.
We can embed multimedia content like images, audio and video in a webpage using these 2 tutorials.

Welcome to the series of Spoken Tutorials on Inkscape.
In this series, we will familiarize ourselves with Inkscape and its features.
We will learn to: * draw and edit various predefined shapes
Use the Color Wheel
Use the Bezier Tool
Use and manipulate text as per requirement
for e.g. superscript and subscript
Superimpose image on text.
In this series, we will also learn to  create  a tile pattern using a combination of shapes
graphics like a flower
brochures and flyers
posters and banners
CD labels
Visiting Cards
Logos and many more.
To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 and Windows 7 OS
Inkscape is an  Open Source vector graphics editor.
It works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
Inkscape can be used for all kinds of 2D graphic design such as-
To draw illustrations and figures/cartoons
To create colorful patterns/backgrounds
To create a web page layout
trace images
To create web based buttons and icons
To manipulate images for the web.
Inkscape can be installed on Ubuntu Linux using Synaptic Package Manager.
For more details on Synaptic Package Manager, refer to the Linux tutorials on this website.
Go to Dash home. Type: Inkscape.
Now we will learn to install Inkscape on Windows.
Open your browser. Go to inkscape.org.
Click on Download button. Select the Installer option corresponding to Windows.
You can find the sentence Download Inkscape..... with this version. Click on it.
Notice, the dialog-box appears. Click on Save.
The installer file will be downloaded on your machine. Go to Downloads folder.
Double-click on the exe file to install Inkscape.
The default language is English.  Now click on Next.
Again click on Next.
Again click on Next
Destination folder dialog box appears. By default, Inkscape is saved in Programs files. Now click on Install.
Inkscape is installing. This may take few minutes.
Click on Next. Click on Finish to complete the installation.
Now, the Inkscape software opens up automatically.
If not, notice there is a shortcut icon created on the desktop. Double-click to open it.
If both these methods to open Inkscape fail, you can click on Start menu > All programs and then on Inkscape.
The Inkscape interface will now be opened.
Now, I will switch back to Linux to complete this demonstration.
However, the steps shown will work in Inkscape on any OS.
The main drawing area is called canvas. This is where we will create all the graphics.
There are various tool options and menu options in Inkscape. We will learn about each one, in detail, in the series.
Now, let's briefly learn how to use Inkscape.
We will create a rectangle shape by selecting the rectangle tool.
To draw the rectangle shape, click on the canvas and drag.
Here is our rectangle.
Let me save this Inkscape drawing.
Go to File menu. Click on Save.
I will name it as drawing_1.svg and save it in my Documents folder.
Here, 'svg' denotes the default Inkscape file extension.
We will learn more about Inkscape and its exciting features in the coming tutorials.
I have already shown you glimpses from the tutorials in this series earlier.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Embedding Images in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
To practice this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of HTML.
If not, then go through the corresponding tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
gedit Text Editor
Firefox web browser and  A working Internet connection
However you may, use any other editor or browser of your choice.
In HTML, we can embed the image as a
Normal image,  Background image
Link or  Single image with multiple links
This is the syntax to embed an image in a HTML file
Important note:
Sharing files on the web without reusable permission, is illegal.
Open any text editor and type the code as shown here.
Now save this file as media.html in your project folder.
For this demonstration, I have already done so.
Now let us embed an image in this file.
We can embed an image in any one of the following ways:
From the computer
By downloading from the Internet or
Let us switch back to the text editor.
In the media.html file, within the body tag type the code as shown here.
Then save the file.
This is the code that will embed myimage.png
Common image formats supported by most web browsers are:
Jpg or jpeg
gif
Let’s open our HTML file media.html in any web browser.
I will open it in Firefox web browser.
Observe that, there is an icon which looks like broken document.
This is because, in my code I have embedded an image using the img tag.
But the image file named myimage.png is not present in the same folder as the HTML file.
In that case, the browser will show this broken document icon.
Update the code as shown.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
The broken document icon disappears and the text, My Image is displayed.
So, when the image is not available or loaded, the value in the alt attribute gets displayed.
As I don't have any image in my computer, I will download it from the Internet.
In the browser, open a new tab.
In the “Search the web” text box, type tux logo and press Enter.
Click on the Images tab below the search bar.
Then click on Tools.
Then click on Labeled for reuse.
This way of searching, will display all the images with reusable rights.
From the results, click on the image you wish to download.
The image will get displayed in a bigger size along with the source site details.
Then right-click on the image and select Save Image As option.
Save the image as myimage.png in the project folder.
Switch to the Media Page tab and refresh the page.
Now the page is displaying the image and not the alternative text.
By default the image will be displayed based on its actual dimension.
We can set the width and height of the image inside the img tag according to our need.
To do so switch the code.
Here the values of the width and height is in pixels.
Provide the dimensions in such a way that the image does not get stretched.
Save the file.  Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Switch back to the code.
It is always advisable to specify the width and height with the help of style attribute.
So let’s update the code as shown here.
Save the file.
Switch back to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice there is no change.
We can also use some more attributes for the image, such as:
Kindly explore these on your own.
Suppose, we don’t want to store the image in our project folder.
In such cases, we have to specify the exact path of that folder in the source attribute.
Now suppose we want to display an image from the web.
Then, we can provide that image’s website url in the src attribute.
Let’s see an example. Switch to the browser.
Then go to the tab where we searched for Tux logo.
Right-click on the selected image.
Come back to the code.
Delete the src value myimage.png
Here instead of the filename of the image, we have mentioned the website link for the image.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser.
Based on your internet speed, it may take few seconds to load the image from the given link.
In some websites, you may notice that images act like links.
Now we will see how to do that.
Switch to the text editor.
Next to the img tag, type the code as shown.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice the text link, Spoken Tutorial.
Clicking on this text, will redirect us to the Spoken Tutorial website.
Go to the Media page tab.
Next to the text Spoken Tutorial, we can see our image once again.
If you over the mouse cursor on the 1st image, it's just a cursor.
If you hover the cursor on the 2nd image, the cursor changes to a hand icon.
By clicking on this 2nd image, it will redirect us to the Spoken Tutorial website.
Here in both the cases, I have created a hyperlink for the website Spoken Tutorial.
In the first case, I have created the link for the text.
In the second case, I have created the link for the img tag.
So adding the img tag inside the anchor tag will create the hyperlink for the image.
Notice, both the img tags are same.
You can customize the attributes as per your need.
Next, let us learn about Image Maps.
Image Maps are used to mark a particular area in an image.
With this we can create multiple links in a single image.
I have already updated this part of the code for this demonstration.
Pause the tutorial and update the same in your code file.
I have inserted an image lo.png with the help of img tag.
Please make sure that lo.png is in the folder where media.html is saved.
The same file is available in the Code files link.
Here I used an attribute named usemap and I have set the value as lo.
Next I have created a map tag with the name lo
Then inside the map tag, I’m defining the area with the following attributes.
Shape as rectangle.
Coordinate positions in the image.
Then closed the map tag.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser
Next to the tux image we see an image with some icons of LibreOffice Suite.
Hover the cursor on each icon.
When we hover the cursor on the first 2 icons, there is no change in the cursor.
But when we hover the cursor on the 3rd icon, the cursor changes.
When the cursor crosses the border of the icon, the cursor is back to normal.
This behaviour of the cursor is based on the coordinates we marked in the code.
Click on the Base icon.
Immediately it takes us to the specified link.
Likewise, we can create multiple links or labels in a single image.
With this we come to the end of the tutorial.
Alternative text for the image
Creating image as a link
Customizing the width and height of an image and
Embed the Python Django icon in it.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Working with data.
Speed up using Fill tools and Selection lists.
Sharing content between sheets.
Removing data, Replacing data and Changing part of a data.
Here, we are using GNU/Linux as our operating system and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
Entering data into a spreadsheet can be very labor-intensive but Calc provides several tools for making it considerably easier.
The most basic ability is to drag and drop the contents of one cell to another with a mouse.
But Calc also includes several other tools for automating input, especially of repetitive material.
These tools are namely- “Fill tool”, “Selection lists”.
These can input information into multiple sheets of the same document.
We will learn about each one of them, one by one.
Let us open our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file.
The Fill tool is a useful method for duplicating the contents in the sheet.
In our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file, let's say we want to copy  the data under the heading “Cost” to the adjacent cells.
Then, first select all the data which needs to be copied by clicking on the cell which contains the entry  “6000”.
Now, holding down the left mouse button, drag the mouse till the end of the cell which contains the  cost entry “2000”.
Also, select the cells where we want to copy the data.
Now, release the left mouse button.
Click on the “Edit” option in the Menu bar and then click on the “Fill” option.
In the pop-up menu, click on the “Right” option.
You see that the data under the heading “Cost” gets copied to the adjacent cells.
A more complex use of the Fill tool is to use it for  filling some series as data in sheets.
Calc provides default lists for the full and abbreviated days of the week and the months of the year.
It also enables the user to create his own lists.
Now let's insert a new heading named “Days” in our sheet.
Under this, we will display the seven days of the week automatically.
Select the first seven cells below the heading “Days”.
Now, click on the “Edit” option in the Menu bar and go to the “Fill” option.
Click on the “Series” option in the menu.
You see that a dialog box appears with the heading as “Fill Series”.
Now under the heading, “Series type”, click on the “AutoFill” option.
In the “Start value” field, we type our first day of the week, that is, “Sunday”.
The increment is already set as “1”.
You see that the days are automatically entered into the cells.
You can enter only weekdays, month or year by the same method as they are pre-defined in Calc.
Another method for auto-filling of sequential data is as follows-
type “Sunday” in a cell and press Enter.  This will shift the focus to the next cell in the column.
Go back to the cell where “Sunday” was typed.  You will now see a small black box at the bottom-right-hand corner of the cell.
Click on this box with the mouse.
Drag it downwards till you see "Saturday" in the display box on the right.
The cells get filled with the weekdays automatically.
This trick works for all data that are sequential. Let us undo the changes.
You can also create a one-time fill series for numbers by entering the start, end and the increment values.
To demonstrate this, we will first delete the serial numbers already entered in the cells A1 to A7.
After deleting the numbers, select the cells referenced as A2 to A7 again.
Now click on the Edit' in the Menu bar and then on Fill and Series option.
A dialog-box appears in front of us. Now click on the Linear option, under the heading Series type, if it is not selected by default.
In the Start value field, we will type the first serial number, that is, “1”.
In the End value field, we will type the last value to be entered as “6”.
Now, we set the Increment value as “1” and finally click on the OK button.
We see that the cells automatically get filled with the sequential serial numbers.
In all these cases, the Fill tool creates only a momentary connection between the cells. Once they are filled, the cells have no further connection with one another.
Apart from Fill tools, there is one more speed up tool called “Selection lists” which is limited to using only text.
We will discuss it in the later tutorials of this series.
After learning about the “Fill tools” and “Selection lists” we will now learn how to share contents between sheets.
Calc enables the user to enter the same information in the same cell on multiple sheets.
This means, instead of entering the same list on each sheet individually, you can enter it in all the sheets at once.
In our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file, our entire data is on “Sheet 1”.
Now, we want “Sheet 2” as well as “Sheet 3” to show the same data as in “Sheet 1”.
So, we click on the Edit option in the Menu bar and then click on the Sheet option.
Now, click on Select.
Now, in the dialog-box which appears, using Shift key we select the options “Sheet 1”, “Sheet 2” and “Sheet 3”.
And then click on the OK button.
This takes us back to “Sheet 1”.
Now, let's enter some data in “Sheet 1”.
For example-in the cell referenced as F12, we’ll type: “This will be displayed on multiple sheets”.
Now, click on the “Sheet 2” and  “Sheet 3” tab one after the other.
We see that in each of these sheets, the cell referenced as F12 contains the same data.
Next, we will learn about different ways in which we can delete and edit data in the cells.
To delete data  without removing any of the formatting of the cell, just select a cell.
You see that the data of the cell is displayed in the “Input line” field.
Now, press the Backspace button on the keyboard.
You see that the data gets deleted.
To replace the data in a cell, simply select the cell and type over the old data.
The new data will retain the original formatting. Let us undo the changes.
In order to change a part of the data in a cell, without removing all of the contents, just double-click on the cell.
Now, by navigating the cursor, you can edit the cell as per your requirement.
Speed up using Fill tools and Selection lists.
Sharing content between sheets.
Removing data, Replacing data, Changing a part of the data.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on built-in functions in awk.
In this tutorial, we will learn about different types of built-in functions like-
String functions,
Input/Output functions and
To record this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 16.04 operating system and
You should have some knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
Built-in functions are always available for awk to call.
First we will learn about the arithmetic functions.
int() function truncates x to an integer value.
exponential  function gives the exponential of x.
log function returns natural logarithm value of x.
sin and cos give sine(x) and cosine(x) respectively.
Please note that argument x should be mentioned in radians.
Let’s look at an example to understand these functions.
I have already written the code in a file arithmetic underscore function dot awk.
Here, we are printing the square root of a positive and negative number respectively.
Next, we are printing the integer value for a positive and negative number respectively.
Then we are printing exponential of a small number and a very large number.
After that, natural logarithm of positive and negative numbers are printed.
We are also printing sine and cosine values of 0.52 radian, that is actually 30 degree.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T Keys.
Next, go to the folder where you have downloaded and extracted the file using cd command.
Now, type: awk space -f space arithmetic_function.awk
Couple of things are clear from this output.
sqrt() function gives square root of a positive number.
It returns nan or not a number if the number is negative.
int() function gives the truncated integer of any positive or negative number.
exp() function gives exponential of a number.
natural logarithm of positive number is given by log() function.
If the number is negative, the function returns nan.
Sine and cosine functions return corresponding values.
Now, let us look at random functions.
rand() function returns any random number between 0 and 1. But never returns 0 or 1.
Generated numbers will be random within one awk execution.
But, predictable across different executions of the awk program.
srand(x) function is used to provide seed value x for random function.
In absence of x, date and time of day is used as the seed value.
I have written a code for the random function and saved it as random.awk.
Here, inside the for loop, rand() function will generate a random number between 0 and 1.
Then the generated number will be multiplied by 50 and get printed.
So, this code will generate 5 random numbers within 50.
Type: awk space hyphen f space random dot awk and press Enter.
See, it is giving 5 random numbers.
What happens if I execute the code again?
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
We are getting the same output. Which means, awk is generating the same set of random numbers for every execution of the script.
Then how can we get a new set of random numbers in every execution?
Before the for loop, type srand() function.
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
It is giving a different set of random numbers.
So, we can generate a new set of random numbers using srand function when it’s used without an argument.
Next we will see some string functions.
index() function determines the position of string s2 within the larger string s1.
For example- index within parentheses within double quotes linux comma within double quotes n, returns 3.
Open the file awkdemo.txt
We know that each student in the awkdemo.txt file has a 4 digit roll number.
Due to typing error, the roll numbers may have wrong number of digits.
Switch to the terminal .
Now, type the command as shown here.
If not, then that particular record will get printed.
See, there is one roll-number S02 that has been typed incorrectly.
It has three digits, whereas all others have four digits.
The substr(s,a,b) function extracts a substring from a larger string s.
Let me explain the parameters.
Here s is the string.
a denotes the position in s from which the extraction would start.
b denotes the number of characters that would be extracted.
Switch to the awkdemo.txt file.
Here, the first letter of the roll numbers represents the Hostel code where the particular student resides.
Say, we want to find the list of students who are staying in Hostel A.
To get that, let’s switch to the terminal.
Here, we take the string denoted by $1.
As we know, $1 represents the first field that is roll number in our case.
Next, we extract a substring that starts at position one with the character length one.
Then, if it is equal to capital A then that line from the file will get printed.
We got the list of students who are in Hostel A.
We have seen the function split() earlier.
Please refer to the earlier awk tutorials if you have any doubt.
There are some other functions which are related to Input/Output.
Now, we will run the unix command date through awk command.
In the terminal, type the command as shown here.
Today’s date and time is displayed on the terminal as an output.
Now, why do we need this? We have kept only the BEGIN section of the awk command.
In real world scenarios, we may want to print the system date, before displaying the required output.
In that case, we would need to execute system commands from awk command.
There are some functions dealing with time stamps like -
Browse through the Internet to know about these functions.
In this tutorial, we learnt about different types of built-in functions like-
where name of the student has small u as the third letter using the awkdemo.txt file.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Create a MARC Framework.
In this tutorial, we will learn to create a MARC Framework in Koha.
If not, please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website.
Before we begin, note that-  Frameworks can be edited or deleted.
Superlibrarian can create their own frameworks, as per the requirement of their libraries.
Let us begin. Let me switch to the 'Koha' interface.
Login with Superlibrarian username Bella and her password.
Now we are inside the Koha interface as Superlibrarian Bella.
Go to Koha administration.
Under the section Catalog, click on MARC bibliographic framework.
Click on plus New framework.
Another page opens up, prompting us to fill in the details-
In the field for Framework code, I will type BK.
For Description:, I will type BOOKS.
Next, click on Submit button at the bottom.
On the new page that opens, go to the Code BK i.e. BOOKS.
From the tab Actions, click on MARC structure.
A new page MARC Framework for BOOKS (BK) opens up.
Another page with the same title MARC Framework for BOOKS (BK) opens.
This shows tags from 1 to 20 of 342 tags.
However, you may see more number of tags on your screen.
Note that there are a total of 342 default tags.
Notice here that there are options to Edit or Delete a tag.
I will demonstrate how to Delete.
I will choose the tag number 010- Library of Congress Control Number.
Upon clicking the Delete tab at the extreme right side, a pop-up window appears asking-
Click on Yes, delete this tag.
Another window appears with the message ‘Tag deleted’. Click Ok.
The same page MARC Framework for Books (BK) appears again.
On this page, ‘Tag’ number 010 will no longer be shown.
Similarly, delete any other tags which may not be relevant to a particular item type.
To edit the tags, go to Actions and choose the Edit option.
I will go for tag number 000, Leader.
Then click on Edit.
The following fields are filled by default, by Koha itself-
Note that:  The 'Label for lib' will show up in the staff client.
As per your requirement, check the check-box for Repeatable:
Koha will, by default, check the check-box for Mandatory.
I will check the check-box for Repeatable:.
Note that if you click Repeatable' then the field will have a plus sign next to it, in Cataloging.
This is basically required for more than 3 authors or editors, allowing you to add many more details of the same tag.
If 'Mandatory' is clicked or auto-selected by Koha then the record will not be allowed to save, unless you allocate a value to this particular tag.
Let’s go back to the Koha interface.
After filling in all the details, click on Save changes.
In the new page that opens up, note that  for tag number 000, Leader: Repeatable and Mandatory will appear as Yes.
Next, let us learn how to enable Authority file.
Go to Koha Administration.
And click on Global system preferences.
Acquisitions preferences page opens.
From the list of tabs on the left side, click on Authorities.
Under the section General, start changing the Value of Preference as follows:
For AuthDisplayHierarchy, select Display from the drop-down.
For AutoCreateAuthorities, select generate.
For BiblioAddsAuthorities, select allow.
Leave-MARCAuthorityControlField008 and UNIMARCAuthorityField100 as it is.
For UseAuthoritiesForTracings, Koha, by default, selects Use.
Under the section Linker, default values should be retained for-  CatalogModuleRelink,
LinkerKeepStale,  LinkerModule,
LinkerOptions and  LinkerRelink.
Now, click on Save all Authorities preferences.
You may now log out from the Superlibrarian account of Koha.
To do so, go to the top right corner.
Click on Spoken Tutorial Library and from the drop-down, select Log out.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Function Overloading and Overriding in C++.
Function Overloading Function Overriding.
We will do this with the help of examples.
Ubuntu OS version 11.10
g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with an introduction to function overloading.
Function Overloading means two or more functions can have same name.
The number of arguments and the data-type of the arguments will be different.
When a function is called, it is selected based on the argument list.
Let us look at an example.
In this program, we will perform addition operations.
Note that our file name is overload.cpp.
Then we have add() function defined as int.
In this, we have passed three arguments.
Int a, int b and int c.
Then we perform addition of three numbers and we return the value.
Here we overload the function add().
It is declared as float.
We have  passed two arguments float d  and float e.
Then we perform the addition operation on two numbers.
In function main(), we declare the add() function with different arguments.
Then we declare the variables.
Here we accept integer values from the user.
Then we call the function add() with three  arguments
and store the result in variable sum.
Here we print the result.
Now, here we accept floating point numbers from the user.
Then we call the add() function with two arguments.
And here we print the sum.
This is our return statement.
To execute, type: g++ space overload dot cpp space hyphen o space over
Type: dot slash over
It is displayed- Enter three integers
I will enter   10, 25 and 48.
The output is displayed as: Sum of integers is 83
Now we see-  Enter two floating point numbers
I will enter as: 4.5 and 8.9
The output is displayed as: "Sum of floating point numbers is 13.4" .
Now we will see function overriding.
Let us switch back to our slides.
Redefining a base class function in the derived class.
The derived class function  overrides the base class function.
But the arguments passed are same.
And the return-type is also same.
Let us see an example.
Here is an example on function Overriding.
Note that our file name is override.cpp.
Then we have class arithmetic.
In this, we have declared integer variables as  as protected.
Then we have function values() declared as public.
In this, we have passed two arguments- int x and int y.
Then we stored the values in a and b.
Here we have virtual function as operations().
In this, we add the two numbers and print the sum.
Here we close the class.
Now we have class Subtract as derived class.
This inherits the base class arithmetic.
In this, we calculate the difference of two numbers and we print the difference.
Now we have another derived class as Multiply.
This also inherits base class arithmetic.
In this, we calculate the product of two numbers and display the product.
Then we have class Divide . This also inherits the base class arithmetic.
In this, we calculate the division of two numbers and  we display the division.
Note that the return-type of the function is same and the arguments passed are also  same.
In this, we create an object of  class arithmetic as p.
arith is the pointer to the class arithmetic.
Then we have subt object of class Subtract.
mult object of class Multiply.
And divd object  of  class Divide.
Now here, p is set to the address of arith.
Then we pass arguments as 30 and 12 in function values.
Now we call the function operations().
This will perform the addition operation.
Here we set subt to the address of arith.
And we pass 42 and 5 as arguments.
Again we call function operations().
This will perform subtraction of two numbers.
Now,  here we set mult to the address of arith.
And we pass   6 and 5 as arguments.
We call the function operations().
This will perform the multiplication of two numbers.
At last, we set divd to the address of arith and we pass  6 and 3 as arguments.
Now we call the operations() function.
This will perform the division of two numbers.
Let us execute the program. Switch back to the terminal.
Type:  g++ space override dot cpp  space hyphen o space over2
Type: dot slash over2
Addition of two numbers is 42
Difference of two numbers is 37
Product of two numbers is 30 and Division of two numbers is 2
Let us switch back to our slides.
Let us see the difference of overloading and overriding.
Overloading can occur without inheritance.
Overriding occurs when one class is inherited from another.
In overloading, the arguments and the return-type must differ.
In overriding, the arguments and the return-type must be same.
In overloading, the function name is same.
But it behaves differently depending on the arguments passed to them.
In overriding, the function name is same.
Derived class function can perform different operations from the base class.
Let us summarize:
In this tutorial, we learnt:
Function overloading- eg. int add() with three different arguments  and
float add() with two different arguments.
Then Function Overriding-
eg. virtual int operations() and int operations()
Functions with the same argument and same return-type and difference between both.As an assignment.
Write a program that will calculate the area of rectangle, square and circle
using function overloading.
It summarizes the Spoken-Tutorial project.

Welcome to this tutorial on Animation using Script Commands.
In this tutorial, we will learn to show animations using Jmol script commands.
For demonstration, we will use models of ethane and hemoglobin as examples.
Jmol script commands with the following keywords will be used for animations.
move, delay, slab, loop and capture.
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of high school chemistry and familiar with operations from Jmol window.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu OS version 14.10,
Jmol version 14.1.11 and Java version 7.
This slide shows the function of each animation command in detail.
move command allows you to rotate, zoom and translate a model within a specified period of time.
delay command is used to pause a script for the specified number of seconds.
slab command is used to control the percentage of the molecule to be displayed on panel.
loop command causes the script to restart at the beginning with an optional time delay.
capture command captures animations as animated GIF files.
For more details on Jmol script command, visit the web page for Jmol interactive script documentation.
Let us open the Jmol window and demonstrate an animation using move command.
I will begin with a simple move command using ethane as an example.
Create a model of ethane using modelkit menu.
Click on the modelkit icon, a model of methane appears on the screen.
Click on the hydrogen. Now we have a model of ethane on screen.
Open the console using File menu.
At the prompt, type the following command.
The command line starts with the word "move"
followed by the numbers that quantify a set of animation parameters.
More information about move command: There are nine parameters in the move command.
The first three parameters are rotations around X, Y and Z axes.4is the zoom modifier, expressed in positive or negative numbers,
positive for zoom in and negative for zoom out.
The next three parameters deal with translation along the three axes.
8th is the slab parameter. Slab slices the molecule.
It removes atoms to a specified depth so that interior features may be easily observed.
Parameter 9 is the amount of time, in seconds, taken in performing the move command.
Press Enter and observe the panel.
We can create more interesting animation by adding more commands to the existing ones.
Press up-arrow key on the key board to get the previous command.
Type: delay space 2 after the semicolon.
Here, the delay command pauses the script for 2 seconds, before executing the next command.
Then type another move command after this delay command.
Don't forget to add semicolon at the end of each keyword command. Press Enter. Observe the panel.
We can also change the color of the atoms during this animation.
Again, press up-arrow key to get the previous command.
Edit the command as I have shown here, on the console.
Use select keywords to change the color of the hydrogens and carbons. Press Enter.
Again observe the panel.
Add a "slab" command to make certain parts of the molecule to disappear and appear.
Press up-arrow key again and edit the previous command as shown on the console.
Type: "slab on" after the select command.
Type: "slab off" at the end of the command.
Press Enter and observe the panel.
You can see parts of the molecule disappear and appear again.
You can save this animation as a GIF file, using capture keyword.
Type the "capture" command and specify the file name and path at the beginning of the command.
You can type the name of your home folder to save the GIF file.
I am saving this animation as file “sneha”, on the desktop. Press Enter.
Now the animation will be saved as GIF file on my desktop.
Navigate to the location of the GIF file.
Open the saved GIF file with Image Viewer software.
Similarly, open a pdb file of any macromolecule; for example- oxygenated hemoglobin with a pdb code "2DN1".
Download the structure directly from pdb database using File menu.
Type the pdb code in the text-box, "2DN1". Press OK.
A model of hemoglobin is displayed on the panel.
Type the following command in the Console.
We have used select keyword command to change the color of different units of the protein.
We have also used move command.
This command will display protein in red cartoons.
The Haem part in yellow spacefill display and cut away 50% of the molecule.
Rotate 360º on X-axis in 4 seconds and restore all atoms.
Press Enter and observe the panel.
Let us now use the loop command to repeat all the above steps.
Press up-arrow key to get the same command. Type "loop 2" at the end of the command.
"loop 2" indicates the previous script commands will be repeated after a 2 second delay.Press Enter.
You can be creative and type many more such commands to animate.
Now, let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to
create animation of ethane and haemoglobin  using script commands such as move, delay.
We have also made use of loop and slab commands.
Saved the animations as a GIF file using capture command.
For the assignment-Take a molecule of your choice and create animation using move and delay commands.
Change display, color and size of the bonds to create animation.
If you have selected a column by clicking the alphabet that identifies it or a row by the number that identifies it, then right-click and choose the Insert Columns or Insert Rows option in the drop down menu that appears, in order to add a new column or row.
For inserting multiple columns or rows at the same time, we should first highlight the required number of columns or rows by holding down the left mouse button on the initial cell and then dragging across the required number of identifiers.
Now click on the “Shift cells up” option and then click on the OK button.

Welcome to this tutorial on Gene-Expression-The Basics simulation.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate Gene Expression-The Basics, PhET Simulation.
To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with topics in high-school biology.
Here I am using:  Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04,
Java version 1.7.0,
Firefox Web Browser version 53.02.2
2. Factors affecting Protein Synthesis and
Let us recall about Central Dogma of Genetics.
It was proposed by Francis Crick.
It states that the genetic information flows from DNA to mRNA to Protein.
Protein Synthesis involves two steps.
Transcription is a process of making mRNA.
Translation is a process by which mRNA directs protein synthesis.
Let us begin the demonstration.
I have already downloaded Gene Expression-The Basics simulation to my Downloads folder.
Then type: java space  hyphen jar space gene hyphen expression hyphen basics underscore en dot jar and press Enter.
Gene Expression-The Basics Simulation opens.
The simulation screen shows 3 tabs at the top- Cell Gene Expression,
Messenger RNA Production and Multiple Cells.
By default, Cell Gene Expression screen opens.
Left side of the screen has a Biomolecule Toolbox.
It contains transcription and translation regulatory elements.
At the bottom of the screen, a DNA strand is shown.
It represents Gene 1.
Gene 1 has a Regulatory region and a Transcribed region.
Regulatory Region is acted upon by Positive and Negative Transcription Factors.
Transcribed Region is located after the Regulatory Region in the DNA strand.
It is used to create mRNA.
Information that mRNA strand contains, is found in the Transcribed Region.
On the right side, we have a box showing Protein Collection. It shows the type of protein which we make.
Now let us select Positive Transcription Factor from the Biomolecule Toolbox.
Click on the Positive Transcription Factor.
Observe the Regulatory Region on Gene1.
Shape of Positive Transcription Factor is highlighted.
Drag and place it on the highlighted Regulatory Region.
Now, click on RNA Polymerase from Biomolecule Toolbox.
Observe Gene1, shape of RNA polymerase is highlighted.
Drag and place it on the highlighted area of RNA Polymerase.
RNA Polymerase initiates the transcription process.
We can see mRNA is produced as the Transcription process is initiated.
Now let's see the roles of transcription elements.
Positive Transcription Factor is also known as an activator.
It positions itself on the Regulatory Region.
It encourages the binding of RNA polymerase to the Regulatory Region.
It allows RNA polymerase to produce mRNA.
RNA Polymerase is an enzyme.
It reads transcribed region of DNA to produce mRNA.
It zips down the strand by first passing through the regulatory region.
As an assignment, select Negative Transcription Factor and place it on Gene1.
Select RNA polymerase.
See if RNA polymerase can pass through the transcribed region.
Back to the simulation.
Select a Ribosome from Biomolecule Toolbox.
Drag it on the highlighted area of free floating mRNA.
A type of protein is produced.
It is highlighted on Your Protein collection box.
Select mRNA destroyer from Biomolecule Toolbox.
The position to fit mRNA destroyer is highlighted as dotted outline on mRNA.
Drag and place it on the highlighted area of mRNA.
mRNA is degraded into individual units.
mRNA Destroyer stops mRNA from making additional proteins.
Reset All button is available at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
Click on it to reset the screen to default position.
Click on green Next Gene button at bottom right corner of the screen.
This takes you to another gene which codes for a new type of protein.
Explore and find how this second gene is different from the first one.
Click on Messenger RNA Production tab at the top.
Here we can see various factors that affect transcription that is mRNA production.
We can see two panels. Positive Transcription Factor and RNA Polymerase.
I will increase the Concentrations and Affinity of the Positive Transcription Factor.
Drag the slider of the Concentrations to Lots.
I will keep the Affinity to High.
Also keep the RNA Polymerase Affinity to High.
We can see that RNA polymerase can attach itself to the DNA strand easily.
Now we know that increase in the concentration of Positive Transcription Factor increases its binding to the regulatory region.
It will in turn make RNA polymerase bind faster to DNA.
This results in faster production of mRNA.
Explore Concentration and Affinity sliders and observe the results.
Now Click on the Multiple Cells tab. On the right-hand side there are 3 options-
Concentrations, Affinities and Degradation.
Click on green plus sign to open the panel.
Drag the sliders to change Concentrations, Affinities and Degradation.
Observe the amount of Green Fluorescent protein produced in cells.
Drag the Cells slider from One to Many.
Observe the green fluorescent protein cells.
The brightness indicates the concentration of protein in cells.
In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to use Gene Expression-The Basics simulation.
Using this simulation, we have learnt: about steps involved in protein biosynthesis,
to create mRNA using transcription elements,
to create a protein using translation elements
and to study the effect of factors influencing mRNA production.
As an Assignment: using Cell Gene Expression screen, transcribe gene 2 and put proteins in protein collection box.
Explore the Multiple Cells tab.
Find the name of the cells used in this simulation.
Explain why cells are green in colour.

Hello. Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Material required to construct a biogas plant.
In this tutorial, we will learn about:the various materials required to construct a biogas plant
Area required to construct the plant
The site No. of days required for construction and the best time to construct the plant.
Let us begin. The materials required to construct a biogas plant can be procured from any hardware & cement shop.
The following materials are required to construct the plant:
cement 14 packs,
gravel – half brass,
sand - 1 brass,
3 bundles of chicken mesh- 30 feet each,
weld mesh sheet of size 3 feet x 4 feet with 1 inch x 1 inch of the hole size,
12 feet of 6 mm steel rods- 35kgs,
1 kg of steel wire to be cut into 7-8 inches per piece,
bricks 3, 2kg of white cement,
1 kg of lime powder,
jute gunny bags- 25 approximately,
plastic sheet- 13 feet x 10 feet and
7 bamboo sticks of approximate size - 3.5 feet
Liquid waterproofing material - 1 litre
wooden square trowel with a concave bent from inside.
These are especially used for smoothening the cement plaster on the dome of the biogas plant.
metal square trowel,
shovel,small trowel,  hook,
trough with a capacity of 10 kgs.
scissor to cut the chicken mesh,
one measuring tape,
1kg of newspaper,
scale with two hooves at the two ends and
an iron rod with hollow ends at either sides.
We will now look at other items required to construct the plant such as tubes, pipes and valves.
We require main gas control valve of size 1 inch, metal pipe to be connected from the center of the dome, 30 cms x 1 inch of diameter.
This will be the main gas pipe.
Gas conveyor pipe of 1/2 inch diameter:
the length of this pipe will depend upon the distance between biogas plant and the kitchen.
Inlet pipe connected from mixing tank to digester tank should be 6 inches diameter and approximately 5 feet of length.
Another outlet pipe of 6 inches diameter to be connected from slurry tank to the slurry collection pit.
If the outlet pipe is not required,  alternately construct a drain between slurry tank and the slurry collection pit as shown.
The depth of this slurry collection pit can be between 4 to 6 feet.
The slurry collected in this pit can be manually poured in the fields.
We also require a safety-valve of 1 inch.
Approximately, 6 metres of rubber hose pipe of ½ inch diameter.
This rubber hose pipe will be used to convey the gas from the safety valve to the kitchen stove.
2 Vohj clips are required to secure the pipe.
A few other items like  synthetic resin adhesive 250 ml and teflon tape.
Always use good quality cement, gravel and sand.
These are really important for the durability of the biogas plant.
Let’s now talk about the area, site, No. of days required for construction and best time to construct the plant.
To construct the biogas plant, we need approximately 12 feet X 8 feet of land, near the house.
The site should be such that  construction cost is minimized and  it receives ample sunlight to maintain the right temperature inside the biogas plant.
The selected site should also ensure easy operation and maintenance of  mixing tank, digester tank, main gas control valve to switch off gas inflow and the slurry tank.
The site should also be located near the source of animal dung and the toilet.
This will help to easily operate the plant and avoid wastage of raw materials.
The total no. of days required to complete the civil work of a biogas plant are 3 to 5 days.
The best time of the year to construct the biogas plant is between November and June.
Constructing biogas plants during the rainy season is best avoided, as it becomes messy.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on the material required to construct a biogas plant.
The construction part of the biogas plant will be explained in next tutorial under the same series.
Let’s Summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt: The material required to construct a biogas plant
Area required to construct the plant
Preferred site and
No. of days required along with the  best time to construct the plant.

Right now I am onto the last two common errors that I have included.
And we will start with the hard one.
This is the php header and we are using "header" function going to a location.
And here, I have got some html code.
This is a header tag, I am saying "Welcome!".
And our $goto variable is "google dot com".
If the $goto exists which it currently does, we are going to redirect the page to a u-r-l "google dot com".
Right now, this will return an error
and the error is - Oh! um... Okay that’s why. "o b_ start()".
Let's get rid of this.  That wasn’t supposed to be there. That code is to fix the error!
Sorry, so we will go to the "php header" and we have got "Welcome!" - our html code.
Then a Warning - "Cannot modify  header information – headers already sent by..." and all of this.
Okay; so our headers have already been sent. This is the line number, by the way.
1, 2, 3 so if it gives you an error like "phpheader dot php" colon 3 then the error has occurred on the line number 3.
So that's where the error is - on line 3, okay?
And this error has been generated by line 9 which if you go here, is our "header" function.
So, the reason that this is happening is we are already sending our html code.
If I get rid of this by commenting it and I were to refresh then we would be redirected to google.
But the point is that we want this "Welcome" header here.
And you can’t actually put html before a header function, going to Location and other features of this function.
You shouldn't do so.
So, as you saw a minute ago, that is "ob underscore start()".
What this does is, it fixes this problem for us.
So, if I come here to "phpheader" and it works even though I have still got my html code echoed here, before my header.
So, without this we get an error (pause) and with this our header works fine, okay?
Despite the initial rule of 'no html output before header', up here.
That should be pretty clear by now.
Now, the last one is extremely simple.
I don’t even need to explain it but anyway.
This is include a file which doesn’t even exist named as "idontexist dot php".
So, let's have a look. Um.. where is it? "missing dot php".
Oh no! It's not.  "open dot php".
Okay! So - include idontexist dot php failed to open stream: No such file or directory in that name here.
Our file name and directory on line 3.
So, let's come to line 3.
And that is the only line of significant code in this file.
We have another warning here - Failed to open "idontexist dot php" for inclusion... and all of this.  So, we get two errors.
This is quite messy when you have a page that has include a header file.
Then these don’t look too nice. I mean you have probably been in a website before and you have seen this is at the top.
You need to be attractive.  So, you can put a "@ (at)" symbol in front of it. refresh.
That won't show the error anymore.
But, it doesn’t excuse the fact that the file doesn’t exist.
So the content of the file which doesn’t exist, won’t be included.
But yes, to be honest, looking at this, this is really pretty much self explanatory.  I just thought I should explain this anyway.
So, we have got a small collection of errors that you might come across when you are programming in php.
If there are other errors that you are getting, then please message me and I will be happy to help.

Dear friends, welcome to the Spoken tutorial on    Logical Operators    in    Bash   .
In this tutorial, we will learn use of:
Logical AND
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of:
if-else statement
Ubuntu Linux 12.04    OS
GNU Bash    version    4.1.10
GNU Bash    version 4 or above is recommended for practice.
Let us understand the use of     Logical-operators.
Logical operators    are mainly used to control program flow.
Logical operators    help to link two expressions or    conditions   .
They can be a part of    if, while    or some other    control statements   .
Let s see the syntax of    logical AND   .
Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space closing square-bracket space ampersand ampersand space opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.
Or we can use this syntax-
Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space hyphen-a space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.
Logical AND    returns    True    when both    condition1    and    condition2    are    True   .
Let us see the syntax of    Logical OR   .
Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space closing square-bracket space vertical bar again vertical bar space opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.
Or we can use this syntax-
Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space hyphen-o space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.
Logical OR    returns     True    when either    condition1    or    condition2    is    True   .
Let us learn the usage of     Logical OR    and    Logical AND    using an example.
I have already typed the    code    in a file named    logical.sh   .
Open the    terminal    by pressing    ctrl+alt    and    t    keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Type:    gedit space logical.sh space ampersand    sign, press    Enter.
Now type the code as shown here, in your "logical.sh" file.
Let me explain the    code    now.
This is the    shebang line.
The    read    command reads one line of data from     standard input.
- (hyphen) p    displays the    prompt.
string    is a    variable    which stores the text entered by the user, during execution.
The    if    statement checks whether the entered    string    is    empty.
- (hyphen) z    checks whether length of    string    is zero.
Type:    man space test    on     terminal    to explore various other    string    comparisons.
The    echo       statement    will print a message if nothing was entered.
If the    string    is not empty, the program will move to the first    elif statement.
Here, it checks whether the entered    string    contains both the words  "raj" and  "jit".
If yes, then it echoes out a message.
Please note that    logical AND    is used here.
Hence, the message will be displayed only when both the conditions are satisfied.
If that is not so then the program will move onto the second    elif statement.
Here, it checks whether the entered    string    contains either "raj" or "jit".
If  yes  then it displays the message.
Please note that    logical OR    is used here.
The message will be displayed only when any one of the conditions are satisfied.
Lastly, we have the default    else statement.
When all the above statements are    False    then this statement will be executed.
"fi"    is the end of    multilevel if-else       loop   .
Let us    execute    the program.
Switch back to the    terminal.
First make the file executable by typing-    chmod space plus x space logical dot sh    press    Enter   .
Now type:    dot slash logical.sh    press    Enter.
The prompt displays    "Enter a word:"
I will enter    "jitinraj"    .
The output is:    "jitinraj contains both the words  raj  and  jit  ".
This means that the    control    was passed to the second    statement   .
And as both the    conditions    are satisfied, it displays the message.
Now, let us    execute    the    script    again.
Press the    up-arrow    key.
Go to    ./logical.sh     press    Enter   .
The prompt displays    "Enter a word:"
This time I will enter    "abhijit".
The output is displayed as:    "abhijit contains the word  raj  or  jit ".
Please try executing the program with different inputs and observe the    output   .
Let s switch back to our    slides   .
Let s have a look at    logical NOT    operator.
It inverts the    Boolean    value of an expression
which means, it returns    True    if the expression is    False
and returns    False    if the expression is    True   .
The syntax of    logical NOT    operator is-
Exclamation mark space expression
or     opening square-bracket space exclamation mark space expression space closing square-bracket.
Let us see an example.
I have already typed the    code    in a file.
So, I will go to the    terminal     and type:    gedit space logicalNOT dot sh space ampersand    sign, press     Enter.
Now type the code as shown here, in your    logicalNOT dot sh    file.
This is the     shebang line    as we already know.
$1    is the first    command line argument    passed to the    script   .
- (hyphen) f    checks if the file exists with the same name that was passed as an    argument   .
So, it will return    True    if the file exists and    False    if it does not exist.
This    NOT operator    here, inverses the returned value
which means, if a file of that name exists, the condition will be    True.
But the    NOT operator    will inverse its value to    False   .
And it will display the message    "FILE does not exist"   .
Here, in the    else statement,    it displays the message     FILE exists   .
"fi"    marks the end of    if loop.
Now , switch to the    terminal   .
Let me clear the    prompt   .
Let s create an empty file with the name    test.txt   .
Type :    touch space test dot txt    press    Enter.
Next, make the script executable by typing:
Now, type:    dot slash logicalNOT dot sh space test dot txt    press     Enter.
Our    shell script    will check whether the file exists.
Our file    test dot txt     exists,  hence the value will be    True.
Then the    logical NOT    will inverse that value and return    False.
Because the evaluation is    False   , the    else statement    is evaluated.
And the message displayed is -   File  test.txt  exists   .
Try executing the program again with    argument       test1.txt   .
And observe the control flow as explained before.
Come back to our    slides   .  Let us summarize.
In this tutorial, we learned the usage of:
check whether the file exists
and is executable
using    logical operators      explained in this tutorial.
(Hint:    man space test   )

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of Bezier tool using Inkscape.
Draw straight lines and closed shapes
Draw curved lines
Add, edit and delete nodes.
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode.
This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
First let us draw a straight line using Bezier tool.
The Bezier tool is right below the Pencil tool.
Let's click on it.
Observe the 4 options in the Tool controls bar at the top left.
There are 4 modes of drawing Bezier curve.
By default, the Create regular Bezier path option is enabled.
Click once on the canvas and move the cursor to the other end.
Click once again. Notice that the line drawn is highlighted in green color.
Now, right-click to complete the line.
The two end points of the line are called nodes. We will learn more about them a little later.
Next, let us draw a triangle.
First, draw a slanted line. Click once and draw another line at an angle.
Now click once more to draw a third line and join it with the starting node to complete the triangle.
Next, we will draw a curved line using Bezier tool.
Click on the canvas to draw a straight line. Click again, hold and drag to form a curve.
Right-click to complete the curve.
In a similar way, draw some more curve shapes on the canvas.
Remember these steps- 1. Click and draw a straight line.
2. Click again, hold and drag to form a curve.
3.  Then right-click to complete the curve.
Press Ctrl + A and clear the canvas before proceeding further.
Next, let us learn how to draw a closed curved path.
First draw a curved line on the canvas.
Then we release the mouse and move the cursor away from the end node of the curved line.
We see a curved path in red color.
If you click once and move the cursor, we see a straight path in red color. To make it as a curve, click and drag.
Again at the end node, the line curves as we move.
Again click once; we see a straight path in red color. To make the straight line curved, click and drag.
Again at the end node, the line curves as we move. Move the cursor and go back to the starting node and close the path.
Go to Tool controls bar. Click on the second icon of the mode. This helps to create spiral paths and irregular shapes.
Draw some irregular curves and close the path.
Observe that it transforms into the closest spiral shape. Let me clear the canvas now.
The third icon creates only straight lines. Click on it and draw lines on the canvas.
Note, we cannot draw curved lines in this mode.
We can draw triangles or polygons which have straight sides.
Click on the last icon and draw on the canvas.
In this mode, we can draw only parallel and perpendicular lines i.e. either vertical or horizontal lines.
So, we can draw squares and rectangles in this mode.
Let me delete all the shapes drawn.
Shape option helps to draw lines or curves in a particular shape.
Click on the drop-down button.
There are 5 options here- None, Triangle in, Triangle out, Ellipse, From clipboard.
The first option that is None does not give any effect. So, we will move on to Triangle in.
Click on it and draw a line on the canvas.
The line is transformed to a triangle shape inwards.
Next, click on Triangle out and draw a line on the canvas.
Now a triangle shape is formed outwards.
Click on the Ellipse and draw a line.
Observe that the line is in ellipse shape.
We will learn about the last option that is From clipboard in later tutorial.
Now, let us learn how to add, edit and delete nodes.
This can be done using the Node tool.
Delete the lines on the canvas.
Go to Tool controls bar. Change the Mode to regular path and Shape to None.
Come back to the canvas and draw a rough human palm.
Now, click on the Node tool.
Notice all the nodes in this figure are visible.
Turn your attention to the Tool Controls bar.
The first 6 icons here, help to add and delete nodes and paths.
Refer to the tool tip to understand better.
Click on any segment. Notice both the nodes turn blue.
Then click on the Add node option.
Observe that a new node has been added exactly in-between the nodes of the selected segment.
Now, select a smaller segment and repeat the above steps.
You will see that a new node is added at the mid-point of the smaller segment.
Now, select the newly added node.
Click on the Delete node option. The node is now deleted.
Click on any one of the nodes on the palm.
To make the Bezier handle visible, click on the last but one icon on the Tool controls bar.
Now, the Bezier handles for the selected segment is visible.
If not, then just click on the segment and without releasing the mouse, move it a little.
The segment will curve and the Bezier handles will be visible now.
Click on the handles to resize and rotate the selected node.
In a similar way, modify the other nodes too.
The next icon helps to join nodes.
Observe, there is an extra node on the index finger.
Select the extra middle node and the top node by using the Shift key.
Now, click on Join node icon. Observe that the nodes are now joined together.
The next icon helps to break path at selected nodes.
Let me now break the connection between the thumb and the index finger.
So, select the joining node in between and click on Break path icon.
Un-select the node. Then select it again and move it a little.
You will notice that the path is broken and the nodes are separated into 2 distinct nodes.
To join them, select the same 2 nodes and click on the Join selected end-nodes icon on the Tool controls bar.
Notice, a new path is created between these 2 nodes.
Click on the next icon i.e. Delete segment icon to remove the path or segment. Now the path is removed.
Let me keep this hand aside. Click on the Node tool once again.
Let us learn how to use next 4 icons on the Tool controls bar.
These icons help to edit the selected nodes.
Using the Bezier tool ,draw an inverted U shape. Click on the Node tool. Observe there are 3 nodes.
Select the top node and click on Make selected nodes corner icon on the Tool controls bar.
This makes it as the corner node.
Click on the Bezier handles and move them up and down to see the change.
Click on the next icon to make the node smooth. Observe the change in the shape.
Click on the next icon which makes the node symmetric.
Click on the next icon which makes the node auto smooth.
The next 2 icons work only on segments. So, select the left segment of the U shape and click on the first icon.
As the tool tip says, the segment is now made into a straight line.
Click on the Bezier handle and try to move. You will see that we cannot make it curved.
Click on the next icon to make it a curved line again.
Now, move the Bezier handles and  now we can make it into a curve shape.
Click on the next icon to convert selected object to path.
Click on the next icon to convert the stroke to path.
Click and drag the nodes to make the strokes visible.
The next 2 icons help to move the selected nodes in X and Y directions respectively.
Click on the up and down arrows and observe the change.
The next 2 icons work only if the path has clipping and masking effects.
You can explore these options on your own.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Draw straight lines and closed shapes
Draw curved lines
Add, edit and delete nodes.
Here is an assignment for you-

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating a simple custom module.
In this tutorial, we will learn to-  Create a basic module
Add a basic controller and
Add a routing file
To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 16.04
Drupal 8 ,   Firefox web browser and  Gedit text editor
You can use any text editor and web browser of your choice.
To practise this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Drupal.
To create a custom module in Drupal, you should be familiar with
Programming in PHP
Namespacing in PHP and
Symfony 2
For details of pre-requisites, please see the “Additional reading material” link of this tutorial.
We have already learnt about contributed modules earlier.
Now we will learn to create a simple custom module.
This module will create a custom page showing “hello world”.
Here is the workflow of this module.
The Request is what we request to the website.
Router determines what should be done with the request.
The controller builds the response for the given request.
The View creates the response.
The response is what the website returns.
Here is the file structure of the custom module which we are going to create.
Let us start creating the files required for a custom module.
Open your File browser.
Now go to apps -> drupal -> htdocs -> modules folder.
We have to always create our custom modules inside this modules folder.
Let’s create a folder and name it as custom.
This will separate our custom modules from the contributed modules.
Inside this custom folder, we will create a folder called hello_world.
This folder name is the machine name.
It will be used by core Drupal, to refer to this module.
There are some rules to follow when naming a custom module.
It must contain only lower-case letters, underscores but no spaces.
It must be unique and cannot have the same short name as any other module or theme
It cannot have any reserved terms such as src, lib, vendor, templates, includes, fixtures, etc.
Switch back to our file browser
Inside this hello_world folder, we will create a file called hello_world with info.yml extension.
The name of the info.yml file and the name of the module folder should be the same.
Yml is the file extension of YAML.
YAML is a unicode based data serialization standard for all programming languages.
It is a human-readable language.
This info.yml file is to tell Drupal about our module.
In this file, we will store the metadata of our module.
So type the following metadata.
Let's  save this file.
This is the title of our module which will be shown on the extend page.
This is a small description of our module.
This is what category our module will be listed under on the extend page.
This is to tell Drupal that we are making a module.
The core key specifies the version of Drupal core that our module is compatible with.
Here name, type and core keys are required. Other keys can be ignored.
Next, we will create a file called hello_world with module extension.
For this demonstration, we are not going to add any functionality in this file.
In this file, type the following.
Let us save the file.
These are the two files Drupal requires to create a module.
Now we will install this module in our website.
Open our local Drupal website.
Before installing the new module, we will clear the cache first.
To do that, click on the Configuration menu.
Now click on the Clear all caches button.
You can see that the caches are cleared.
It is compulsory to clear the caches every time we modify our website.
Now to install the module, click on the Extend menu and scroll down.
Under Custom, you can see the Hello World module which we created just now.
Click on it to select.
Click on the Install button at the bottom.
Our custom module is enabled now.
Next, we have to add the router file.
This is to tell Drupal where the module can be accessed from.
The router determines what should be done with the request.
The router also checks if the access is permitted.
Switch back to our File browser.
Now we will create the routing file called hello_world.routing.yml
Type the following inside the routing file. Let us understand the code.
This line is the route.
This indicates what path will be used to access our module.
This is to tell Drupal where to get the content from.
Here content is the function which we will create in the controller file.
This is to ensure only users who can access content, will be able to see our Hello World page.
Next we should add the functionality about what this module is going to do.
This is done by adding a controller.
What is a controller? Controller is a PHP function.
It takes information from the HTTP request and constructs and returns an HTTP response.
Switch back to our File browser.
To add a controller, we should create a folder named src here.
Inside the src folder, we should create another folder named Controller.
Inside this Controller folder, we will create the controller file called HelloController.php
Inside this file, type the following.
Now save the file.
The namespace allows to place a bunch of code under a name, to avoid naming conflicts.
This use statement will import the ControllerBase class.
We have a class HelloWorldController with the function content.
It will return the markup text when the routing system invokes the page.
Now switch to the web browser.
Click on the Back to site button.
Add hello in the address bar as a request to the web browser.
This is the path we created in the routing file to access our module.
We can see our custom page which we created just now. This is the response.
Likewise, we can create other simple custom modules in Drupal 8.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to-
As an assignment, create a custom module for “About us” page of your website.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installing Joomla on local server.
To install Joomla in your system, you should have a system supporting:
Please note that MySQL 6 and higher versions are currently not supported.
You can either install these separately or together, using a web-server distribution like XAMPP, WAMP or LAMPP.
Web-server distributions give you Apache, MySQL and PHP bundled in one.
Refer to the PHP & MySQL spoken tutorials, for more details on XAMPP installation.
For this tutorial, we will be using:
First of all, let me check if XAMPP is installed on my machine.
Let's open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys.
Alternately, click on the “Terminal” icon in the launcher bar.
Now, switch to the browser and type: http colon double slash localhost.
For the very first time of installation, you have to select language.
So, here let us select English.
In the menu on the left of the screen, click on phpinfo().
It will be found in the table "Apache Environment".
Value of DOCUMENT underscore ROOT will be either  slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs or slash var slash www.
Please note this path. We are going to install Joomla here.
First let us download Joomla.
So, go to the official website of Joomla which is www dot joomla dot org.
Click on Download button on this webpage.
We will be redirected to another webpage.
Here, we see a button that says “Download Joomla  3.4.1 Full Package, ZIP”.
Click on that button.
Immediately, a small dialog-box will open.
Here, click on Save File option and then click on OK.
This will download Joomla.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Component oriented modeling.
how to define connector class and
To record this tutorial, I am using:  OpenModelica 1.9.2,  Ubuntu Operating System version 14.04.
But this process is identical to any of the following operating systems.
To understand and practice this tutorial, you need to know  how to define a class in Modelica.
You need to know how to define a package and Icon and Diagram Views.
Prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website. Please go through them.
Now let us learn more about Class Instantiation.
Modelica classes can be instantiated.
For example, an individual can be considered as an instance of human being class. Instance of a class has the same variables and equations as the class itself.
The syntax for Class Instantiation is as shown.
Now, let us understand this through an example.  Please download and save all the files available on our website.
Let me switch to OMEdit.  The following files are already open in OMEdit: classInstantiationExample and simpleCircuit.
Double-click on classInstantiationExample.  Let us discuss more about this class now.
Here, I have instantiated the bouncingBall class to create two objects named   object1 and object2.
Note that each instance has different start values for the height variable h.
Please refer prerequisite tutorials for more information on the bouncingBall model.
Let us simulate this class now.
Click on Simulate button in the toolbar.
The class did not simulate and it threw up an error.
This is because bouncingBall class is not open in OMEdit.
Open bouncingBall class which you downloaded from the website.
Now, simulate this class once again.  Close the pop-up window.
Note that the class simulates successfully this time around.
This exercise demonstrates that a class should be open in OMEdit to be instantiated.
Expand object1 variables in the variables browser.
Note that the variables listed here are declared in bouncingBall class.
These variables are also a part of object1 and object2 since they are just instances of the bouncingBall class.
Now, delete the result and go back to the slides.
Component orientation sets Modelica apart from other modeling and simulation softwares.
It is the single most important feature of Modelica.
component models represent single physical phenomenon.
They can be instantiated and connected to produce desired effect.
For example, an RLC circuit could be developed from resistor, inductor and capacitor models.
Acausal connectors serve as the interface between component instances.
They are defined using connector class. For example, pins can be used as connectors for electrical components.
We will learn more about this when we try to simulate the example for an electric circuit.
Connectors contain across and flow variables and they cannot contain equations.
Now, let us simulate this Electric Circuit shown in the slide.
The voltage of battery is given by {VoSin(2pift)}, where Vo is 10 Volts, f is 1 Hz and the resistance is 5 ohm.
Let us take a look at the Solution Methodology to model the electric circuit shown in previous slide.
Hence, define a connector named pin.
Define a class named Ground with one instance of pin connector.
Define a class named Resistor.
The Resistor class should have two instances of the pin connector: Positive pin and the Negative pin.
Define a class named VoltageSource with two instances of pin connector as we have seen in the case of resistor class.
Define a class named simpleCircuit.  simpleCircuit should have instances of Resistor and VoltageSource.
Connect the respective pins of Resistor, ground and the VoltageSource.
The component models required have already been programmed.
Hence, I shall demonstrate only the last two steps of Solution Methodology.
Let me switch to OMEdit.  Go back to the Modeling perspective.
Let me shift OMEdit window to the right.
Expand simpleElectricCircuitpackage in the Libraries Browser.
Note that this package has five classes named:  pin,  Ground,  Resistor,   Voltage Source and   circuit.
Double-click on simpleElectricCircuit. Close ClassinstantiationExample.
Let me shift OMEdit window to the left once again, for better visibility.
Modelica.SIunits package has been imported in the package simpleElectricCircuit.
Hence, type definitions in that package can be used without reference to their full names.
Let us try to understand pin connector.  Scroll-down a little bit.
Pin is defined using connector class.
Voltage and current are the variables that a pin exchanges with its surroundings.
Potential at the pin is defined by v.  Voltage and Current are types defined in SIunits package of Modelica library.
Voltage across a component causes a current to flow through it.
Hence, current is a flow variable and is defined using flow keyword.
pin connector also has an Icon view specified by annotations as shown.
Now, let us discuss a little about Resistor class.  Scroll down a little more.
As discussed in the Solution Methodology, Resistor class has two instances of pin connector.
p stands for positive pin and n stands for negative pin.
Now, let me show you how to instantiate a class using the drag and drop functionality of OMEdit.
To demonstrate that, let me open a new class using Ctrl + N.
Name this class example1 and press Ok.  Shift OMEdit window to the right.
Go to Diagram View if the class opens in Text View.
Now, let me instantiate pin class.
Left-click on pin icon in Libraries Browser.
Hold and drag the icon to the diagram layer.  Drop it at any location on the canvas.
We have now created an instance of pin class.
You may also change the dimensions and location after dropping it, as shown.
Now, let us see how this class is instantiated in Text View. Go to Text View.
Notice the command for instantiation of class pin and an annotation based on its placement in Diagram View.
Hence, creating an instance of a class in Diagram View automatically reflects in the Text View. Now, let me close example1 tab.
Let us learn how to model electric circuit that we saw in the slides.
Double-click on Circuit icon which is also a part of simpleElectricCircuit package.
This class already has our circuit of interest assembled, as can be seen in its Diagram View.  It is ready to be simulated.
But let us build the same circuit in a new file.
We shall use drag and drop functionality that we have just learnt about.
Press Ctrl + N.  Name this file circuit(underscore)construction. Press OK.
Switch to Diagram View, if it opens in Text View.
Select, drag and drop the VoltageSource icon from Libraries Browser.  You may change its dimensions as you wish.
Similarly, select, drag and drop the Resistor icon from Libraries Browser.
Do the same with Ground class.
Now, we need to connect the respective pins of each component.
Let us first connect the positive pin of Voltage Source to the positive pin of Resistor.
Hover over the left pin of Voltage Source.
The text that appears indicates that this is the positive pin p.
Left click on this pin and drag the cursor closer to the left pin of Resistor.
Leave the mouse when the appearance of cursor changes to cross from an arrow.
Similarly, connect the negative pin of resistor to the negative pin of voltage source.
We have not mentioned the connections with Ground in the circuit diagram.
But, we need to connect the negative pins of Resistor and Voltage Source to Ground individually.
This ensures a reference point for potential in the circuit.
Now, this class is complete.  Save the class by pressing Ctrl + S.
Click on Simulate button.  Close the pop -up window.
The class has simulated successfully.
Let me shift OMEdit window to the left, for better visibility of Variables browser.
Expand Resistor column in the Variables Browser and select Ir.
Note that the profile is sinusoidal as expected
since the Voltage Source is an AC source instead of DC.
Hence, we have created a model from its component parts and simulated it.
We shall learn more about the Resistor and Voltage Source classes that we used here in the next tutorial.
As an assignment, construct an electric circuit with two resistors in series  with one Voltage Source.
Use the component models for Voltage source and Resistor provided in simple electric circuit package.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Foreign key constraint.
how to add a foreign key and
To record this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 14.04 operating system,
PostgreSQL 9.3.x and
To follow this tutorial, you should have  basic understanding of database and tables.
For more details, refer to the RDBMS – PostgreSQL series on this website.
This is the students table which we created.
I want to add details such as department name and department head for each student as shown here.
As we can see, the department name and department head data is repeated.
So, we will separate these data into different tables and then relate them with foreign key.
It is important to separate student and department data into separate tables since one can exist without another.
What is a foreign key?
A foreign key represents a link between columns in two different tables.
A foreign key in a table points to a primary key in another table.
A table can contain more than one foreign key constraint.
The table that has the foreign key is called as the referencing table or child table.
The table to which the foreign key references is called the referenced table or parent table.
Let’s see an example of foreign key link between students and department tables.
Here, the department table is the parent table in which the departmentid is the primary key.
Deptid column is the foreign key which references the departmentid of the department table.
Note that the foreign key column and the referenced key column must have similar data types.
Open the SQL editor window in the pgAdmin.
First let us create the parent table department i.e the referenced table.
Type the code.
Let's insert some data to the department table.
Clear the editor window.
Now, let us retrieve the records.
This is the parent table. Each student must belong to one of the departments shown here.
Switch back to the pgAdmin main screen.
We have already created the students table with the 'Create table' command.
Next we need to add a new column deptid to the existing students table.
To do so, we need to use the Alter table command.
Alter table command is used to change the structure of an existing table.
This command is used to add, delete or modify columns in an existing table.
Using this command, even the data type of the columns can be changed.
The syntax to Alter table is ALTER TABLE table-name ADD new-column-name data type;
The syntax to add multiple columns at the same time is shown here.
Let’s switch back to the pgadmin SQL editor window for the demonstration.
Let us add a new column by the name deptid to the students table.
Let us check this.
Right-click on students column node and select Refresh to update the changes.
Now, let us add the foreign key constraint.
Type the code as shown. Here, deptid column of students table is a foreign key.
This references the departmentid column of the department table.
The foreign key constraint maintains referential integrity between the child and parent tables.
This means that the values in a column must match the values in some row of another table.
Let us now execute the query.
Go to the pgAdmin main screen.
In the SQL Pane, we can see a constraint name for each constraint automatically created.
We can also specify a constraint name while creating or altering a table.
Use this constraint name to drop the constraint if it is not required later.
Now right-click on students node, and then on View data and then on View All rows.
Deptid column is empty. Let us add department details to each student as shown.
Let me type 'MEC' for Mechanical department, for the student Pooja and press Enter.
We can see a error message of “foreign key violation”.
Foreign key constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key columns.
It has to be one of the values of the referencing column. I.e departmentid column value from the department table.
Click on the OK button.
Now, I'll enter 'MT' as department id and save the record.
Enter a valid departmentid for other students also as shown.
Let me open department and students table in 2 different windows.
These tables have One-to-Many relationship.
This relationship is created using Primary key and Foreign key constraints.
Let us see the advantages of using Foreign key.
For example, it will enforce every student should have a department.
For example, it controls the entry of different names of head for the same department.
Next we will learn more about Alter table command.
We can use ALTER TABLE – Alter column command to change the data type or length of a column in a table.
The syntax is ALTER TABLE table-name ALTER column-name TYPE data type;
Say, I want to change the cgpa column's length from 2,1 to 3,1.
Type the code as shown and then execute.
Now, the cgpa column length is altered in the students table.
Let's check. Refresh the students table and see the changes.
Next we will learn about constraints.
Constraints are the conditions or rules enforced on columns or tables.
These are used to prevent invalid data entry into the database.
Column level constraints are applied to only one column.
Some of the commonly used constraints in PostgreSQL are:
Primary key constraint,
Next, we will see how to add a check constraint to the cgpa column.
Here, I have given the constraint name as cgpa underscore chk.
It specifies a condition that the cgpa value should be between 0 and 10.
Let’s now execute the query.
Now, let us insert one more record to the students table with cgpa as 22 and see what happens.
Right-click on students node, select View Data and then Views All Rows.
I'll enter the data as shown.
In the cgpa column, I'll enter 22 and press Enter.
We can see an error message of check constraint violation.
This indicates that we have entered a invalid data.
Now enter 10 as cgpa, CS as deptid and save the record.
Let us see the syntax for how to use constraints in the create table command.
Switch to the pgAdmin main screen.
Click on the students node and then refresh.
Now come to the sql pane.
We can add constraints while creating a table if the table structure is properly designed initially.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about
how to add a foreign key and Check constraints.
As an Assignment, alter the students table to add a NOT NULL constraint to the column city.
Insert a record and leave the city column empty.

This tutorial is a continuation of the previous tutorial on Database Design.
And we will learn the following topics here:
Set up the table relationships.
In the last tutorial, we started the process of database design for a simple Library application.
We first determined the purpose of building the Library database.
Then we continued the process by finding and organizing the information about the library and
we divided the information into Tables.
And so, we had identified four tables in our Library database: Books, Authors, Publications and Members.
Let us now go to the next step which is turning the information items into columns.
Here, we will decide which information item we want to store in each table.
Each information item which we identified earlier, becomes a field and is displayed as a column in the table.
As shown in the image on the screen, the Books table has 5 columns which are also called fields.
So, each row or record here contains information about exactly one book in its columns.
Similarly, each record in the Authors table contains information about just one author.
And each record in the Publishers table contains information about just one publisher.
Now, we can further refine the columns based on our requirements.
For example, we can split the Author name into First Name and Last Name so that we can search or sort by these columns.
And, we don’t have to store results of calculations as separate columns in tables
because Base can perform the calculations whenever we want to see the results.
Now that we are clear about tables and columns, let us see how we can specify primary keys next.
What is a primary key?
Each table should include a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row stored in the table.
This column or set of columns is the primary key of the table.
This is often a unique identification number such as a Book Id or an Author Id.
We can use the 'primary key' fields to quickly associate logical related data from multiple tables and bring the data together for us.
And we cannot have duplicate values in a primary key.
For example, we cannot use people’s names as a primary key because names are not unique.
There can be two people with the same name in the same table.
Next, a primary key should always have a value.
If it is empty or Null then we cannot consider it a 'primary key'.
And we can force a primary key column to have a value always by setting the column’s data type as an ‘AutoNumber’ which Base will generate automatically.
As shown in the image on the screen, we can set up the primary keys for our tables as follows:
BookId for Books table,
AuthorId for Authors table,
PublishersId for Publishers table.
Similarly, though not shown here, MemberId will be the primary key for the Members table.
Finally, by setting up the primary keys in the tables, we are enforcing Entity Integrity.
'Entity Integrity' ensures that there are no duplicate records within the table.
It also ensures that the field that identifies each record, within the table, is unique and never Null.
Now that we have the primary keys in the three tables, we can bring them all together by setting up the relationships.
Since Base supports this concept, Base is called a Relational Database Management System, RDBMS in short.
There are a few types of relationships and we’ll see them now.
First we will see what a One-to-Many relationship is.
Let us consider the Books and the Authors tables in the image shown now.
A book is written by exactly one author.
Now, there are cases where two or several people co-author a single book.
But we will limit our example to just one person authoring one book.
Continuing on with our example, an author can write several books.
So, for one author represented in the Authors table, there can be many books represented in the Books table written by the author.
This is therefore, a one-to-many relationship.
And we can represent this in our 'Library database'.
By taking the Author Id which is the 'primary key' in the Authors table and adding it to the Books table. Simple.
So, the Author Id in the Books table is called the Foreign key.
Similarly, the Publisher Id which is the primary key in the Publishers table becomes the foreign key in the Books table by adding it there.
So, by sharing a column or a set of columns, we can represent one-to-many relationships in the database.
And table relationships can be set up using the Foreign keys.
So, a 'primary key' in a table can be represented as a 'foreign key' in a second table to establish the relationship.
Thereby we enforce Referential integrity.
Meaning, every foreign key value in a table will have a matching primary key value in the related tables.
Next, let us see what a Many-to-Many relationship is.
Let us go back to the table design now.
A book can be issued to any number of library members (considering there are many copies available).
Similarly, a member can borrow any number of books (of course, considering books are available).
So, here we have an example of multiple books being issued to multiple members
which represents a Many-to-many relationship.
So, we can represent this many-to-many relationship in our database
by creating a third table, BooksIssued table, which is also called a Junction table.
And here, we will insert the primary keys from each of the two tables,  Books and Members, into the BooksIssued table.
As a result, the BooksIssued table records each book issued to a member.
So, by creating a third junction table we can represent many-to-many relationships.
And finally there is the One-to-one relationship.
Sometimes, some attributes or columns are specific to certain data only and so are rarely filled up with data.
Let us consider the case where only one author has a website address and the rest of them do not.
And leaving the new website column in the Authors table mostly empty, we will consume disk space.
So, we can move this column into a new supplemental table whose primary key will be the same Author Id.
Each record in the supplemental table will correspond to exactly one record in the main table
which represents a One-to-one relationship.
So there, we have learnt to set up relationships in our database.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on the second part of Database Design in LibreOffice Base.
To summarize, we learned the following topics on database design:

Welcome to this tutorial on Surfaces and Orbitals in Jmol Application.
Create models of alicyclic and aromatic molecules.
Display different surfaces of molecules.
Display atomic and molecular orbitals.
To follow this tutorial, you should know how to create and edit molecular models in Jmol Application.
Jmol version 12.2.2 and
Java (JRE) version 7.
I have opened a new Jmol application window.
Let us first create a model of cyclohexane.
Click on modelkit menu.
A model of methane appears on the panel.
To create cyclohexane, we have to make a hydrocarbon chain of six carbon atoms.
We will substitute the hydrogen in the model with a methyl group.
To do so, we will place the cursor on the hydrogen and click on it.
This is a model of ethane on screen.
Repeat this step another 2 times and replace one hydrogen at a time with a methyl group.
Click on the hydrogens in such a way that the structure forms a circle.
Now, rotate the structure on screen using the Rotate molecule tool.
This is the structure of butane on the panel.
Click on the modelkit menu.
Click on hydrogen on any of the carbon atoms present at the end of the chain.
Here is a model of pentane on the panel.
Click on one of the hydrogens, that is close to the end of the carbon chain.
A model of cyclohexane is created on the panel.
Use minimize option in the modelkit menu to optimize the structure.
The model of Cyclohexane is now in its most stable “chair” conformation.
Alternately, we can also use Drag to bond option in the modelkit menu to create cyclic structures.
I will use a model of pentane to demonstrate this feature.
This is a model of pentane, on the panel.
To convert this into cyclopentane, select Drag to bond option from the modelkit menu.
Place the cursor on the carbon present at one end of the chain.
Hold down the mouse button.
Without releasing the mouse button, bring the cursor to the carbon present at the other end of the chain.
Now, release the mouse button.
We have a model of cyclopentane on the panel.
Now, let us go back to the Jmol panel with the model of cyclohexane.
Let us now convert cyclohexane to a benzene ring.
We have to introduce double-bonds at alternate positions in the cyclohexane ring.
Open the modelkit menu.
Place the cursor on the bond between any two carbon atoms and click on it.
We now have cyclohexene on the panel.
Next, we need to introduce two more double-bonds in the structure to convert it to benzene.
Click on the bond between the next two alternate carbon atoms.
We have a model of benzene on the panel.
Do the energy minimization to get a stable conformation.
Surface topology of the molecules can be displayed by using Jmol Application.
To view different surfaces, open the pop-up menu.
Ensure that the modelkit menu is closed, if it is open.
Now, right-click on the panel to open the Pop-up menu.
Scroll down and select "Surfaces".
A sub-menu opens with many options-
Dot Surface,
van der Waal's,and some others.
For demonstration purpose, I will select Molecular surface.
The model of Benzene  is displayed with a molecular surface.
Let us change it to another surface, say, Dot Surface.
So, open the pop-up menu again and choose Dot Surface.
We can also make the surfaces opaque or translucent.
To do so, open the Pop-up menu.
Scroll down to Surfaces and select Make Opaque option.
Observe that the benzene model has become opaque.
To turn off the surface option- open the pop-up menu, choose Surfaces,
scroll down to Off and click on it.
Now, we have a model of benzene without any surfaces.
Jmol can display atomic and molecular orbitals of molecules.
Atomic orbitals can be displayed on the screen by writing commands on the console.
Open a new Jmol window by clicking on File and New.
Now, open the console window by clicking on File and then on Console.
The console window opens on the screen.
I am using KMag Screen magnifier to magnify the console window.
The command line for atomic orbitals starts with isosurface phase atomicorbital.
At the ($) dollar prompt, type: "isosurface phase atomic orbital".
This is followed by quantum numbers n, l and m that are specific for each atomic orbital.
To display 's' orbital, type: 2 0 0
The Numbers 2, 0, 0 represent n, l and m quantum numbers respectively.
Press Enter key to execute the command.
We have s-orbital displayed on the panel.
Here are few more examples of atomic orbitals and the corresponding script commands.
The command line is same for all atomic orbitals.
To display the previous command on the console, press up-arrow key on the keyboard.
Edit n, l and m quantum numbers to  2 1 1.
Press Enter key and see the 'px' orbital on the Jmol panel.
Press up-arrow key again and edit n, l and m to 3  2 and -1.
Press Enter key and see the 'dxy' orbital on the Jmol panel.
We can also save these images in different file formats like jpg, png or pdf.
Here is a list of commands for all atomic orbitals (s, p, d, and f).
Shown on this slide are models of atomic orbitals.
They were created with the help of script commands written on the console.
Here, I have opened a new Jmol panel and console to show how to display molecular orbitals.
Hybridized molecular orbitals such as sp
We have a model of methane on the panel.
Methane has molecular orbitals of the type sp
Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals i.e. LCAO method is used to create molecular orbitals.
So, the command line starts with 'lcaocartoon', followed by create and the name of the orbital.
At the dollar prompt, type: "lcaocartoon create sp3"
Observe the model of methane with sp3 hybridized molecular orbitals.
To display sp2 hybridized molecular orbitals, we will take ethene as an example.
This is a molecule of ethene on the panel.
Ethene molecule has three sp2 hybridized molecular orbitals. They are named sp2a, sp2b and sp2c.
At the dollar prompt, type:  "lcaocartoon create sp2a", press Enter.
Observe the sp2 orbital in the ethene molecule on the panel.
Press up-arrow key and change sp2a to sp2b, press Enter.
Again, press up-arrow key and change sp2b to sp2c,  press Enter.
Finally for the pi bond, edit the name of the orbital as pz.
On the panel, we have ethene molecule with all the molecular orbitals.
This slide shows examples of few other molecules with molecular orbitals.

Hello friends. Welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on how to dub from one language into another in 'Linux' Operating System.
For this, all you need is a headset with an audio input or a stand-alone microphone and speakers which can be attached to your computer.
Audacity® is a free and open source software for recording and editing sounds.
It is available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and other operating systems.
You can download it free of cost from the site:  audacity.sourceforge.net/download.
I am using the Ubuntu Linux 10.04 version operating system.
I have already downloaded Audacity version 1.3 and installed it on my PC through the Synaptic Package Manager.
For more information on how to install software in Ubuntu Linux,
please refer to the spoken tutorials on Ubuntu available on this website.
The first and foremost thing you need to do is to listen to the original video.
Then translate the script in such a way that the narration time for each sentence is of same or lesser duration than the sentence in the original script.
This can be done by noting down the begin time of each sentence.
If you cannot do this for every sentence, you can do this for a combination of two sentences.
That is, even if there is a mismatch at the end of the first sentence, the sync should become correct after the second sentence is completed.
It may also be possible to skip a few words or even sentences from the original
so long as the meaning is not changed. Please ensure that this is done.
Now, we will open audacity. Click on Applications >>
Sound & Video and choose Audacity to run it.
This will open an empty project on your screen.
We will learn about some of them as we go along. Under the main menu, you will see the VCR controls - Pause, Play, Stop, Rewind, Forward and Record.
Next to this, you will find the Audacity Tools toolbar.
This has the Selection Tool and the Time Shift tool which we will use in this tutorial.
By default, the Selection Tool is active.
Let's do a dubbing now. I will play a tutorial on Scilab which is in English, that is – 'matrixoperation.wmv' (tutorial plays).
And, I need to dub this tutorial into Hindi using Audacity. I have already done its translation and noted the timings as mentioned earlier.
Now, I’m going to record it here. For recording, click on the Record button and start the narration.
(साइलैब के इस्तेमाल से मैट्रिक्स ऑपरेशन के इस ट्यूटोरियल में आपका  स्वागत है । इस ट्यूटोरियल के अभ्यास केलिए आपके सिस्टम में साइलैब का संस्थापन होना आवश्यक है ।)
Click on the STOP button to stop the recording. You will notice 2 stereo tracks on the Audio Timeline where the narration can be seen.
The spikes are waveforms. Stereo Tracks contain a single label area to the left with two waveforms on the right.
These correspond to the 2 channels of input - left channel and right channel.
Ideally, record in one go. You will end up with a single audio track. Remember to pause for 1 second in between sentences, in this case.
Now, split the clip into smaller clips at the beginning of each sentence. Ctrl+I is the shortcut for splitting the audio tracks into smaller clips.
I will split the audio here. Slide the clip on the track to match the timing of that sentence as noted earlier.
Choose the time-shift tool. Observe that the cursor is now a double-headed arrow.
I will shift the clip to this time. Remember, you have to go in the reverse direction, that is, starting from the last clip to the first.
This is because unless you create space, the previous clip cannot move from its position.
To start with the next narration, that is, narration  of the next sentence, click on the Selection Tool. Click on any one of the channels on the timeline.
Now, click on the Record button to start... "साइलैब कंसोल विंडो को खोलिए". Now click on the Stop button to stop.
This second narration will come in another stereo track . Likewise, you can record different narrations which will be seen on different tracks.
Now, we will see how to merge all these narrations or how to bring them onto a single track. Choose the Time shift tool.
Select the audio clip by right-clicking on it and drag-and-drop it at the end of the first audio track. Similarly, do so for all the clips.
We can remove an audio track by clicking on the 'X' button in the label area. Let me remove the second audio track which is now empty.
While sliding the clips on the first track, remember to match the begin time of the clips to the begin time of the corresponding sentence, as noted earlier.
Once we have synchronized the beginning of each sentence with the corresponding time noted earlier, we can save our project. To do so, go to the File menu and click on Save Project As.
A dialogue-box will open. Click on OK. Next it will ask for a file name. I am giving this file name "hindi _matrix_operation".
Next it will ask for the location where it has to be saved. I will choose Desktop and click on Save. This will save the project as a '.aup' file.
Finally, export the final project to the required audio format i.e. 'wav', 'mp3' and others.
To do that, go to the Menu Bar. Click on File. Choose the Export option. Click on it.
It will ask for a file-name. I will give the name as "scilab_hindi _matrix_operation".
Also, give the location where it has to be saved.
Next, choose the format for saving. I will click on 'ogg' format and then click on Save.
Next you will get a box called Edit Metadata. Here, you can add the artist's name and other information as per your requirement.
Click on OK. This will create your final audio file.
'ffmpeg' is an open source audio and video converter that supports most standard codecs.  It can convert from one file format into another, quickly and easily.
The binary for 'ffmpeg' is available for download from:
Click on Download. Scroll down and choose the appropriate one.
To learn how to install packages in Linux, please watch the spoken tutorials on Ubuntu, available on this website. Once you have downloaded and installed ffmpeg,
you will be able to execute simple yet powerful commands to extract video or audio components separately from a media file or merge the video and audio from 2 separate media files into one.
Let me switch to the terminal window.
Let me type: pwd, 'present working directory', and press Enter. Displays my 'Present Working Directory'.  The "ls" command will list all the files and folders which are present in this directory.
Let me change to the Desktop directory and "Test". Ctrl+L to clear the terminal screen, "ls" to list the files present in this directory.
Now, let me type the command  - ffmpeg -i compiling.wmv TEST0.ogv.
The '-i' switch tells 'ffmpeg' that the file immediately after it, is the input file. 'compiling.wmv' is the input file here.
If the '-i' option is omitted, 'ffmpeg' overwrites that file when it tries to create the output file.
'ffmpeg' uses the extension of the output file to determine the output format and the codec to use. However, this can be overridden using command-line parameters.
We will look at some of these shortly. This command is very useful to convert a video from one format into another.
To execute this command, press Enter. But, I will skip this and proceed further.
Using the 'ffmpeg' command in the Terminal window, we can separate the video component from the original spoken tutorial.
To do so, type: ffmpeg -i functions.ogv -an -vcodec copy TEST1.ogv
The '-an' switch automatically removes all audio from the output and keeps only the video component. 'TEST1.ogv' is the output file.
Press Enter. Now we have separated the video component which means that the video is devoid of the original audio.
Let me open the 'Test' folder here. Here is 'Test1.ogv'. Let me play this file. <Play for 5-6 secs>.
Let me clear the terminal window once again. Now, let us type the command:
The '-vn' switch removes the video from the output and keeps only the audio component. Press Enter to execute this command.
Now, we have separated the audio component which means that the output is devoid of the original video.
Let us check it. Let me open the 'Test' directory once again. Here is 'TEST2.ogg'. Let me play this. <Play for 5-6 secs>. OK.
So, let me close this. Let's go back to the terminal window. I'll clear the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+L.
Now, let us see how we can merge the audio which we saved with the video of the original tutorial.
In the terminal, we will type:
It is encoding now. Let me clear the terminal. Let me open the 'Test' directory. Here is 'FINAL.ogv', just as we saved.
Let me play this file now. <Play for 5-6 secs>. Simple!! isn't it?
Now, one can also use editing packages like KdenLive, Kino, LiVES and many others to replace the existing audio of an original spoken tutorial with a dubbed audio.
To make things easier for our dubbing contributors, we are in the process of creating a GUI application in Python
which executes all of the above 'ffmpeg' commands, that is, to Extract Audio, to Extract Video and to Merge.
The application and the spoken tutorial for the same will soon be available on this website.
That's all we have. Let me summarize the tutorial for you. Install Audacity once through Synaptic Package Manager.
Listen to the original tutorial and mark the begin time of each sentence. Open Audacity. Start narrating with appropriate pauses between sentences. Ideally, record in one go.
Split the audio into sentences. Starting from the back, slide the clips to match the noted timing.
When done, save the audio stream in 'ogg' format. Using 'ffmpeg' commands, separate the video component from the original spoken-tutorial.
Merge the dubbed audio and the separated video component to create the dubbed tutorial.

Welcome to this tutorial on Circular Motion.
In this tutorial we will,
Calculate angular velocity and angular acceleration.
Calculate centripetal force.
Here I am using,
Firefox Web Browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial learners should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For the pre-requisite tutorials please visit this site.
Let us first define uniform circular motion.
It is a motion of an object on a circular path with a constant speed.
For example: Moon, revolves around the earth in uniform circular motion.
Use the given link to download the Apps.
I have already downloaded the Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
Right-click on circularmotion_en.htm file.
Select the option Open With Firefox Web Browser.
Uniform Circular Motion app opens in the browser.
The interface shows a white coloured point on a circular path.
This white coloured point behaves as an object on a circular path.
Scroll down to see the complete interface.
Next to the circular path, we see a graph.
This graph shows the change in position of the object with time.
Click on the Start button.
Click on the Slow motion check-box to see the motion steadily.
The bold red vector shows the instantaneous position of the point.
The other two red vectors show the position of the point along the x and y axes.
Uncheck the Slow motion check-box.
Click on the Reset button to reset the App.
The initial position of the white point is 2 metre on x-axis and 0 metre on y-axis.
This is because the white point is on the circle that has a radius of 2 metre.
Click on the Velocity radio button.
Observe that the direction of the velocity vector is tangential to the circular path.
Click on the Start button and observe the change in direction of velocity.
Notice that the magnitude of the velocity is same but its direction changes continuously.
Observe that the representation on the y-axis has changed to velocity.
In the graph y-axis has changed from x, y to V
Click on the Reset button.
Above the linear velocity the App has shown Angular velocity, denoted by omega.
Click on the Start button.
Select Slow motion check-box.
Here the bold pink vector shows the magnitude and direction of velocity.
The other two vectors show the magnitude and direction on the x and y coordinates.
Uncheck the Slow motion check box.
We can calculate angular velocity using the formula.
Click on the Reset button.
Change the Radius to 5 metre,
Period to 10 seconds and Mass of the object to 10 kg.
Press Enter after changing every value.
I have already calculated the value of angular velocity.
The value of angular velocity is 0.628 rad/s (radians per second).
The calculated value is same as the value shown in the App.
Click on the Acceleration radio button.
Here the blue vector shows the direction of acceleration.
The magnitude of acceleration is 1.97 metre per second square.
The direction of acceleration is towards the center of the circle.
This is the formula to calculate centripetal acceleration.
Substitute the values of angular velocity and radius into the formula.
Again click on Acceleration radio button.
Here is the calculated value of centripetal acceleration.
Observe that the calculated value is same as the one shown in the App.
Click on the Force radio button.
Note that the direction of Force vector is same as that of the Acceleration vector.
Recall from Newton's second law that force and acceleration are directly related to each other.
Click on the Start button.
Force acting on a circular field is a centripetal force.
This force is always directed towards the center.
Click on the Reset button.
Let us solve a numerical to find centripetal acceleration.
Please pause the video and read the numerical.
Then change the parameters according to the numerical.
Details about all calculations are shown in the Additional material.
For now I will calculate centripetal acceleration using the formula.
Click on Velocity radio button.
Let us substitute the values of angular velocity and radius into the formula.
The calculated value of centripetal acceleration is 3.15 metre per second square.
Click on the Acceleration radio button to compare the value.
Observe that the values are comparable.
As an assignment solve the following numericals by changing the parameters.
Let us move on to Carousel App.
To open the App right-click on carousel_en.htm file and Open With Firefox Web Browser.
Model of a Carousel App opens in the browser.
Below the name a short description about the interface is given.
Let us scroll down to see the interface.
This App shows the application of centripetal force.
Notice that eight pendulums are attached to the carousel.
Here we have four radio buttons.
By default Carousel is selected.
In the green panel we can change the values of the text-fields.
Let us change the Period to 2 seconds and press Enter.
Notice that the speed of the carousel has increased.
Due to increase in speed radius of the axis of rotation increases.
The pendulums move away from the center.
Click on the Numerical values radio button.
Here we can see different parameters that App has calculated.
The value of Velocity is 5.21 metre per second.
Note the values of Frequency, Angular velocity, and Centripetal force.
Let us increase the Period to 5 seconds.
As we increase the Period, Frequency, Angular velocity  and Centripetal force have decreased.
Click on the Carousel radio button.
Observe that the carousel speed has slowed down.
Let’s change Distance between suspensions and axis of rotation to 1 metre.
Distance between suspensions and axis of rotation can be changed from 0 to 1 metre.
Observe that the size of the carousel has increased.
Let’s decrease Distance between suspensions and axis of rotation to 0.3 metre.
Note the decrease in the size of the carousel.
Change the Length of the string to 0.5 metre and observe the changes on the carousel.
Note that we can vary the Length of the string between 0 to 1 metre.
Similarly we can vary the Mass between 0.1 to 10 kg.
Click on F5 key on the keyboard to Reset the App.
Click on the Carousel with forces radio button.
Here it shows three force vectors.
Let us change Period to 2 seconds  to see the vectors clearly.
Click on the Pause button.
Black vector shows the force due to the weight.
Blue vector shows the force exerted by the string
And red vector is the net force pointing inward.
To get a clear view of the vectors let us select Sketch radio button.
Here we can see a 2D view of the force vectors.
Click on Carousel radio button.
Click on the Resume button.
Let us solve a numerical by varying the parameters in the App.
Now, Let us change the values according to the numerical.
To calculate the centripetal force we can use the formula :
Click on the Numerical values radio button.
From here we will take the values of radius and velocity.
Now calculate the value of centripetal force.
Substitute the values into the formula.
Observe that the values are comparable.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating Matrices using Data Frames.
Convert a data frame into a matrix
Create a matrix in R
Perform basic operations on matrices
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Data frames and Vectors in R
Basics of Matrices
R script in RStudio
How to set working directory in RStudio
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use the data frame CaptaincyData.csv and a script file myMatrix.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to Matrices folder in myProject folder on the Desktop.
I have also set Matrices folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myMatrix.R in RStudio.
For this, click on the script myMatrix.R
Script myMatrix.R opens in RStudio.
Here, I have used rm function to remove all existing variables from memory.
This prevents errors such as use of older data.
Run this script by clicking on the Source button.
The captaincy data frame is displayed in the Source window.
We need our data in a matrix form to:
Calculate the inverse of a matrix
Perform matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
Hence, we need to learn how to convert a data frame into a matrix.
Let us get back to RStudio.
We will convert the values in first three rows of played, won and lost columns into a matrix.
We will create a subset for extracting these values.
Click on the script myMatrix.R
In the Source window, type the following command. Press Enter.
I am resizing the Source window.
Press Enter to go to the next line.
Press Enter at the end of every command.
1 colon 3 indicates that the first three rows are to be extracted.
c is the concatenate vector command with names of each column within double quotes.
Save the script and execute the current line.
The variable subData appears in the Environment window.
Click on the arrow before subData to expand its contents.
Now, we will convert this subset into a matrix.
In the Source window, type matrixA then press Alt and hyphen(-)keys simultaneously.
Now type as dot matrix, within parentheses type subdata and press Enter.
as.matrix function is used to convert the subdata into a matrix.
In Source window, type print, within parentheses matrixA.
Save the script and run these two lines.
The content of matrixA is shown on the Console window.
Now let us create a 3 by 3 identity matrix.
Create a vector named values containing the row-wise values of a 3 by 3 identity matrix.
In the Source window, type the following command and press Enter.
Now we will create a variable matrixB to store the matrix created using vector values.
In the Source window, type the following command. Press Enter.
Press Enter to go to the next line.
Here, I have used matrix function with following arguments:
data of values vector
number of rows as nrow equal to 3
number of columns as ncol equal to  3
byrow equal to TRUE indicates that, data provided has to be arranged row-wise in the matrix.
Now, type print within parentheses type matrixB to show the contents of the matrix.
Save the script and run the last three lines of code.
The identity matrix is shown on the Console window.
Now let us perform some arithmetic operations on matrices.
I will resize the Source window.
We will add and subtract matrices A and B.
In the Source window, type matrixA space plus sign space matrixB.
Next, type matrixA space minus sign space  matrixB
Save the script and run these two lines.
I will resize the Console window to see the output properly.
The resulting matrices are shown on the Console window.
Let us perform multiplication of individual elements of two matrices.
In the Source window, type matrixA space asterisk sign space matrixB
Save the script and run the current lines.
The resulting matrix is shown on the Console window.
Now, we will perform a true matrix multiplication with these matrices.
1st row of matrixA is multiplied by 1st column of matrixB.
Hence number of columns of matrixA should be equal to the number of rows of matrixB.
In the Source window, type matrixA space percentage sign asterisk percentage sign  space matrixB.
Save the script and run the current line.
The resulting matrix is shown on the Console window.
Now let us calculate the transpose and determinant of matrixA.
In the Source window, type t and matrixA in parentheses.
Now, type det and matrixA in parentheses.
Save the script and run these two lines.
The corresponding output is shown on the Console window.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to:
Convert a data frame into a matrix
Create a matrix in R

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Dictionaries.
In this tutorial, we will learn to,
First we will learn about dictionaries.
Dictionary is an unordered collection of items which has key:value pairs.
Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be.
The values of a dictionary can be of any data type.
But the keys must be of immutable data type such as strings, numbers or tuples.
Type ipython3 and press Enter. From here onwards, remember to press the Enter key after typing every command on the terminal.
Let us start by creating an empty dictionary.
Type, empty is equal to open and close curly braces Note that unlike lists, curly braces are used to define a dictionary.
Now let us see how to create a non empty dictionary.
Type as shown. Note that,
Here, we have defined four entries in the dictionary student.  The keys are name, age, gender, class.
Type, student to see its content.
Next let us learn to access the dictionary elements.
The value of a dictionary can be accessed using the corresponding key.
The syntax is: dictionary underscore name inside square brackets key
Now let us access the value for the key ‘name’.
Type, print inside brackets student inside square brackets inside single quotes name
As expected it printed the output as raj.
Now we will retrieve the value for the key ‘class’
Type, print inside brackets student inside square brackets inside single quotes class
If we try to access a value with a wrong key, we get an error.
Type, student inside square brackets inside single quotes height
The interpreter gave us the KeyError: 'height' This is because, key 'height' is not present in the student dictionary.
This is about creating dictionaries.
Next, let us see how to add or delete items in a dictionary.
First let us add an element height to the dictionary student.
Let us now check the content of the dictionary.
Next let us modify the element class of the dictionary student.
Now, to check the content of the dictionary, type, student
As you can see, the value for class key is changed to 11 .
Next let us learn to delete age from the dictionary student.
Type, student You can see that now key-value 'age': 16 is deleted from student.
Next let us see how to check whether a key is present in a dictionary.
The method in will return True if the key is found in the dictionary. It will return False if key is not present.
Note that we can check only for the presence of the keys in dictionaries and not values.
Keys of a dictionary are not ordered.  Hence, slicing and striding are not valid on dictionaries.
Let us try it with an example.
Type, inside single quotes school in student We get False, since the key 'school' is not present in student.
Type, inside single quotes name in student We get True, as expected.
Next let us see how to retrieve keys and values of a dictionary.
Now let us try the above methods with examples. Type, student dot keys open and close brackets  It returns the list of keys of the dictionary student.
Type, student dot values open and close brackets
Next let us see the items method.
It returns a list of tuples of key-value pairs of the dictionary student.
The order of items of the list returned by keys(), values() and items() cannot be predicted.
In dictionaries, they are not in the order in which we inserted them.
Print the keys and values of the dictionary student one by one. Hint: use the method items and for loop.
Type as shown. It displays the keys and values one by one.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
Delete elements from a dictionary by using the function del
and  Iterate over elements of a dictionary using a for loop.
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
This is Priya from IIT Bombay, signing off. Thanks for watching.
Welcome to this tutorial on Curve Fitting.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate Curve Fitting PhET simulation.
The learner should be familiar with topics in high school mathematics.

In the Functions box, Linear and Best Fit radio buttons are default selections.
Let us click the Help button.
A legend for draggable error bars appears in the first quadrant.
The data points can be pulled out or put in the bucket.
In the fourth quadrant, Best Fit equation is seen with the display boxes for a and b.
The equation is y equals a plus bx. Below the display boxes is the correlation coefficient r squared.
In the 2
The formula for the chi squared statistic is given in the Help box.
Below the formula, we see the conditions for fit.
Good or very good fit of data with the equation is seen with a chi squared statistic of or below 1.
Let us click on Hide Help to hide these boxes.
Drag three data points out of the bucket.
Placing the mouse on them will show their co-ordinates.
Note that the equation for the best fit line drawn is y equals 6.07 plus 0.912 x.
The correlation coefficient r squared for the best fit line is 0.9616.
The closer the r squared value is to 1, the better is the prediction of variance in y from x.
Note that the reduced chi squared statistic is 6.74. The bar is red.
Click on Help and note that this means that the fit is poor. Again click on hide Help.
Let us drag another data point and place it at 0 comma 11 on the y axis.
Note that the best fit line becomes y equals 7.51 plus 1.004 x.
The slope of the best fit line has increased slightly from 0.912 to 1.004.
The y intercept has also increased from 6.07 to 7.51.
The data point 0 comma 11 is further away from the best fit line than the other points.
Note how the r squared value decreases from 0.9616 to 0.8529.
The prediction of variance in y from x with this equation has become less reliable.
Note also how the reduced chi squared statistic has increased from 6.74 to 18.66.
Drag the data point from 0 comma 11 to 0 comma 6.
Note how the equation becomes y equals 6.05 plus 0.911 x.
The r squared value increases to 0.9635, the reduced chi squared statistic falls to 3.37.
Drag the data point from -4 comma 4 to -4 comma 3.5.
The r squared value increases to 0.9772.
The reduced chi squared statistic falls to 2.12.
Click on Help; the green zone shows good fit.
Click on Hide Help.
A true best fit line explains all the data and gives a good prediction of y values from x values.
Click Adjustable Fit radio button.  Drag sliders a and b to values close to 0.
Observe how this erases the line drawn earlier.
A line parallel to the x axis is seen.
Slider a and b values will be displayed in the boxes.
The data points are still where we placed them.
The r squared value is 0, meaning poor correlation.
Click Best Fit radio button again.
Note down the values for a and b (5.94 and 0.918).
Again, click Adjustable Fit radio button. Now drag sliders a and b from end to end.
Observe the effects of these changes on the line. Drag slider a to 6 and b to 0.97.
The line looks like the best fit line we saw earlier.
Check Show deviations and click Best Fit.
The vertical lines from the data points to the best fit line show the deviations from the line.
Drag the data points at -4 comma 3.5 and 0 comma 6 into the bucket.
R squared approaches 1 and the reduced chi squared statistic becomes 0.
The fit has become too good because a line is defined by two points.
Without a third point, there is no question of the line being anything but the best fit line.
Now, we will look at some information for you to graph a quadratic polynomial.
Quadratic polynomials are of the form y equals a plus bx plus c x squared.
The degree of the polynomial is 2, hence, it is called quadratic.
The function can have a maximum of 2 roots.
Drag and place data points at the following co-ordinates.
Note the r squared and reduced chi squared statistic values.
Also, click Adjustable Fit and see effects of a, b, c on the fit.
This is what the best fit graph for this quadratic polynomial will look like.
Cubic polynomials
Note the r squared and reduced chi squared statistic values.
This is what the best fit graph for this cubic polynomial will look like.
Quartic polynomials
Note the r squared and reduced chi squared statistic values.
This is what the best fit graph for this quartic polynomial will look like.
As an assignment, Change the data points and their number.
Follow the steps shown earlier to get best fit graphs for all the polynomials.

This tutorial is contributed by Kaushik Datta and Priyam Nayak. Thanks for joining.
In this tutorial, we will learn the following topics:
Let us first learn about Indexes.
What is an Index?
An Index is a way to find and sort records within a database table faster.
We can choose one field or multiple fields in a table on which the records need to be indexed.
The Index stores the location of records based on the chosen field or fields.
So, to retrieve data, Base can move to the location of the data directly by using the index.
And so, it is considerably faster than scanning through all of the records to find the data.
The primary key of a table is automatically indexed.
Now, let us create an index in our example Library database.
We will create an index on the Title column in the Books table that will speed up searching on book titles.
Let us first open our 'Library' database, if not already opened.
And open the Books table in Edit mode.
In the Table Design window, let us go to the Tools menu and choose Index Design.
In the Indexes window, notice that Base already has included the Primary Key as a Unique Index.
Let us click on the left most icon, New Index, to create our index.
And choose Title in the drop-down list under the Index field on the right.
We can also choose the Ascending or Descending order here
and rename this index to ‘IDX_Title’ by clicking on the third icon on the left and save it using the Save icon next to it.
So, there is our index on the Title field.
In this way we can create, edit, rename or delete indexes for tables using Base.
Create an index on names in the Members table and call it ‘IDX_MemberName’.
Next, let us see what a Table Filter is.
'Table Filter' feature allows us to hide tables in a Base database from other applications.
As an example, let us hide all tables except the Books table in the 'Library' database.
Now, Table Filter is available under the Tools menu.
Here, let us check All Views and check the Books table.
Meaning, we are marking only the Books table to be visible to other applications.
Now, let us click on the OK button.
Next, click on the View menu and then on Refresh Tables.
Notice that Books is the only table visible here.
Also, when accessing this database from LibreOffice Writer or Calc, we will only see the Books table there.
Here is another assignment:
Open LibreOffice Writer, access the Library database and check the tables available there.
Bring back all the tables to visibility in Base.
And reopen 'LibreOffice Writer' to check the tables’ availability again.
Finally, let us learn about the SQL command window.
The 'SQL command window' is accessed by choosing SQL from the Tools menu.
We can use this window to issue SQL statements to the database.
Now, we can also use Queries to execute SQL queries but there we are limited to only asking for data from the database.
Meaning, we can issue only SELECT statements there.
But we cannot execute SQL statements which modify data and table structures or to create new tables there.
And the 'SQL command window' helps us to use such data manipulation and data definition statements or language.
Examples of Data Manipulation Language or simply DML are:
INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE data.
And some examples of Data Definition Language or simply DDL are:
CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE and ALTER statements.
We will first see a DML example.
In the Base window, let us open the SQL Command Window from the Tools menu.
Let us insert a new record into the Books table by typing in the “Command to execute” text area:
INSERT INTO "Books" ( "Title", "Author", "PublishYear", "Publisher", "Price")
Before clicking on the Execute button, let us look at the command closely now.
The INSERT statement lists the table name and the field names and then the Values that need to go into the new record.
Notice that the table name and field names are enclosed in double quotes.
We know that Base is case sensitive and the double quotes ensure that Base will accept the names as we created.
If we don’t use the quotes, Base will automatically convert all names into upper cases.
We have to use single quotes to encase the values that are of data type TEXT.
NUMERIC fields need not be encased with any quotes.
Also, we need not include the BookId field which is an AutoNumber field.
Base will take care of auto-generating the number.
So, let us execute the SQL. Notice the message ‘Command successfully executed’.
If there are any errors with the SQL we wrote, Base will point them out.
Let us double-click on the Books table and look for the new record we just inserted.
There it is, appended in the last row.
Next, let us see a DDL example.
We will create a new table called Authors with fields AuthorId, Author and Country.
In the SQL command window, let us type as shown in the screen
and execute it.
Let us go back to the Tables list and Refresh the tables from the View menu.
There is the new Authors table we just created.
To know more about DML, visit the website shown on the screen.
To know more about DDL visit the Wikipedia website shown on the screen.
Use the UPDATE statement to set the price of the book with BookId as 3, to Rs. 300
Delete the book that has the title ‘'The Hobbit'
Insert a new record into the Authors table, author name as ‘J.R.R. Tolkien’, and country as‘England’
Drop the Authors table from the database by using the DROP statement.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on HERE document and strings.
special-purpose redirection called Here documents and Here strings
with the help of some examples.
Let us learn about 'Here' document.
It is a special purpose block of text or code.
It is a form of I/O redirect.
It feeds a command list to an interactive program or command line.
It can be treated as a separate file.
It can also be treated as multiple line input redirected to a shell script.
Syntax is-command space less than less than space HERE.
After this, on the next line, we can give the text inputs.
It can consist of any number of lines.
Here, text1, text2, textN are the text inputs.
After the text inputs, on the next line, we type the keyword HERE again.
It denotes the closing of HERE document.
Let us understand this with an example.
I will open a file named here dot sh .
The first line of code is the shebang line.
Let me put a block of code after this line.
'wc' represents word count.
wc hyphen w counts the number of words in the HERE document.
The block of code or text until the second occurrence of HERE will be treated as a file.
The content present in HERE document is an input to the command wc hyphen w.
HERE acts as a delimiter for wc hyphen w command while reading multi-line input.
If we try to execute the same command in the terminal, we should get '4' as an output.
This is because we have passed four words to the command wc hyphen w.
Now click on Save to save the file.
Let us switch to the Terminal using Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Type: chmod space plus x space here dot sh
Type: dot slash here dot sh
We can see the output as 4
that is, number of words in 'Here' document is 4.
Let us add two more words here, at the beginning of the text.
Hello and welcome to Bash learning.
Let us execute the program again.
On the terminal, type: dot slash here dot sh
Now the output is 6 because we added two more words to our text.
We can also pass an argument to the Here document.
Let us see how to do this with an example.
Let me open a file named hereoutput dot sh.
The command cat will concatenate files and print the standard output.
Note that we have used the string "this"  instead of "HERE".
It’s not necessary that you always have to use the delimiter HERE.
You can use any other delimiter also.
This line will display the 0th (zeroth) argument.
The 0th (zeroth) argument, by default, is the filename.
This line will display the 1st argument passed to the program.
And this line will display the 2nd argument passed to the program.
Here we have to close the document using the same delimiter this.
Save the file. Let us now execute the program.
On the terminal, type: chmod space plus x space hereoutput dot sh.
Press Enter
Type: dot slash hereoutput dot sh space Sunday space Monday
"0'th argument is: dot salsh hereoutput dot sh"  which is the filename.
"1st argument is: Sunday"
"2nd argument is: Monday" .
Let us learn about "Here" string now.
Here string is used for input redirection from text or a variable.
The input is mentioned in the same line within single quotes.
The syntax is- command space three 'less than symbols' space within single quotes write string
Let us understand this with an example.
I will open the same file here dot sh.
Here at the end, I will type: wc space hyphen w three less than symbols space within single quotes Welcome to Bash learning.
This will redirect the string within quotes to the command wc hyphen w.
Now click on Save to save the changes.
We will switch to the Terminal.
Now type: dot slash here dot sh.
We can see the output as 6 and 4.
Number of words in here document is 6 and number of words in here string is 4.
Likewise, you can write your own Here strings.
HERE document
HERE string.
As an assignment, convert a string to uppercase using:
'Here document'Here string.
Hint: tr space  a hyphen z space capital A hyphen capital Z.
This is the command to convert characters from lower to upper case.

The village girl Meena returned home from school, feeling shaky and shivery and looked tired.
She was complaining of body pain, head ache as well.
The worried mother who came near her noticed that she has a high temperature.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First aid in case of fever.
Here we will talk about:the symptoms of fever the primary care and consulting the doctor.
Any person who's temperature goes above the normal temperature i.e 96.8 to 100.4º Farenheit,  is considered having fever.
Let us see what are the symptoms of fever.
Increase in temperature
Aches and pains
Shaking and shivering
Severe headache and
Soar throat.
The mother, seeing the shivering condition, wrapped the child in a blanket to keep her warm.
Let us check what to do and what to avoid in case of fever.
Give the patient a sponge bath in luke warm water.
Give the patient lots of water to drink.
Do not wrap the person in a blanket or thick clothing.
Do not give medicines on your own.
Always give medicines after consulting the doctor.
Do not block fresh air.
In fact, fresh breeze helps to lower the fever.
Seek immediate medical help in case the patient shows the following symptoms:
Irregular breathing
Stiff neck
Persistent sore throat
Rashes
Vomiting, Painful urination & Diarrhea.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on basics of R.
In this tutorial, we hope to provide a feel for R and Rstudio
How can R be used as a calculator?
How to use built-in functions like sin and log?
Introduction to vector operations
Introduction to plotting
Taking help in RStudio and
Where to get more information on R and Rstudio
To understand this tutorial, one needs to know elementary maths.
For example, log, sine and plotting
Please locate this tutorial on our website, spoken tutorial dot org
We provide many useful supplementary material in this page
No programming background is required, however, to understand this tutorial
I am using version 3 of R,Using RStudio 0.97
R and RStudio work on web browsers also
Hence, these are easily accessible from every operating system, including Aakash
Let us continue with system requirements.
For this tutorial, I am using Mac OS X 10.7.4
But the usage is similar in Linux and Windows as well
Let us give a quick introduction to R.
R is an outstanding software for general computations
It is especially suitable for statistical computing
It is an alternative to SPSS
It is a free and open source software
It can be downloaded from c ran dot r dash project dot org
Let us now give a quick introduction to Rstudio
RStudio is a friendly front-end to R
It is a free and open source software
It can be downloaded from rstudio dot com
A two minute video by the RStudio team is available here.
Let me return to the slides.
RStudio also runs on a web browser.
Here is a screenshot of R and RStudio on a web server, accessed from Aakash
Let us do a practice session on R, using Rstudio
You now see RStudio on the screen.
I have shrunk its size quite a bit, to fit into a small screen.
Please use a size you are comfortable with.
I have also enlarged the font size, so that the recording is clear.
You do this on Windows and Linux, by pressing control and + keys together.
For this tutorial, I want to maximise the size of the console of Rstudio.
I do this by pressing the maximise button in the console window.
I also maximise the right lower window of RStudio in a similar manner.
Let me begin multiplying two numbers two point one and five.
R gives the answer in black as ten point five.
I want to divide this by three.
I will recall the previous command by clicking the up arrow.
What I typed earlier, namely two point one into five appears.
I will divide this by three to get the answer three point five.
I can add two numbers.
I can store the result in a variable using the assignment operator.
Less than symbol followed by hyphen.
One can also use an equal sign.
If I want to see what is in a variable, I just type the variable name.
In this case, I type a and see that it has five.
I will subtract zero point one six from a.
I will raise it to the power of zero point 5.
Remember, I have to put a minus zero point one six within brackets, to get the correct answer.
We get two point two, as expected.
Using the left and right arrows, I moved the cursor back and forth within a command.
I can also carry out the same calculation using the function call, square root.
I will find the value of e by using the function call, exp.
You may have noticed, the moment I open a bracket, R automatically closes it.
This eliminates errors due to unmatched brackets. So, we see the value of e above.
I can find the natural logarithm of e with the help of the log function.
The value is one, as expected
How do we find the log to the base ten?
Use the command log10.
Ten to the power five.
This gives the answer as five, as expected.
What happens if I forget the ten in log10?
We get a different answer.
It is easy to verify that this answer is correct for natural logarithm.
Can you please suggest a method to verify this?
There is another way to find the logarithm to the base of 10.
Give the base as the second parameter, as I do here.
We get five, as expected.
It is easy to create vectors in R.
z = s e q -1 comma 2 comma 0:5
This creates a vector starting at minus one, going up to two, in increments of point five
Let us see the value of z.
We will see other ways to create vectors in another tutorial.
We can calculate the length of the vector z using the command length:
We get the result seven, as expected.
We will now discuss pi.
The value of pi, is stored in the variable pi, p i, which we can see now.
Let us create a vector x to start from minus two pi, go up to plus two pi, in increments of one.
Please remember to put the multiply sign.
Let us see what x contains
Let us find the sine of this vector using sin and store it in y.
We can work directly with vectors in R, as we did above.
Let us see what y contains.
Let us plot sin(x) versus x, with type=L argument added.
Note that x comes first and then y.
This plot starts from zero as expected, because sin of minus two pi is zero.
The plot is not smooth, as there are not many points.
Let us now get more points by lowering the increment number to point one.
What happens if I try to plot without recalculating y?
R will complain that the lengths are unequal.
You should pause the video and confirm that the lengths are unequal.
Let me recalculate y.
Let me re-plot this curve.
You can see that the plot is smoother now.
Please pause the video now and look at the values stored in x and y.
Please confirm that these values are as per expectation.
We see the lengths of x and y to be 126.
You should verify that these lengths are correct.
You should also display the values of x and y and verify.
If we drop the type parameter in the previous command, we get a plot with points.
Let us press the help button in the right hand side window.
Let us type plot next to the lens symbol and hit return.
Let us scroll.
One can see different choices for the type parameter.
Let us see a few low cost books on R.
In this tutorial we learnt about, a few elementary operations
Introduction to plotting
Introduction to help
URLs and books on R and Rstudio
We now suggest an assignment
Find answers to log2 (2^5) and log (e^2)
Please explain your answers
Explore the Help tab in RStudio: Change the labels, title, etc.
Hint: try the plot command with x l a b argument
Copy paste a few examples provided in Help and see what they do

The Spoken Tutorial Project team:  * Conducts workshops using spoken tutorials.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Using Python Modules.
In this tutorial, you will learn to-
First we will learn what is a module.
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
Modules are used to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files.
Definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or to the main module.
Now let us see how to run a Python script from command line.
Open any text editor and type,  print inside brackets inside double quotes Hello World
We have created a simple Python script to print Hello World.
Save this script as hello.py in the current working directory.
Now type, python3 hello.py and press Enter.
Next we will see how to import modules and use them in Python scripts.
Let me open the file four underscore plot.py in the text editor.
This file is available in the Code files link of this tutorial. You can download and use it.
This code will plot for x, -x, sin of x and xsin of x
When we run this code, we will see the final plot as shown here.
Now let us run the file four underscore plot.py as a Python script.
Type, python3 four underscore plot.py
It gives an error linspace() is not defined.
It means that, function linspace() is not available in the current namespace.
A namespace is a system for making all the names in a program to be unique.
Let us go back to the file four underscore plot.py.
Add this line as the first line in the script, from numpy import asterisk
When we use asterisk in imports, all the functions and constants are imported from numpy module.
linspace is a function available in numpy.
Now let us run the script again. Now it gave another NameError: name ‘plot’ is not defined.
Let us edit the four underscore plot.py file again.
Add the following as the second line in our script. from matplotlib.pyplot import *
Now save the file.
plot is a function which is available in the matplotlib.pyplot.
We will run the script again. We get the output now.
We imported all the required modules using the keyword import.
Let me close this window.
We can import only functions which are required from a module as, from numpy import linspace, pi, sin
instead of, from numpy import *
In the same way we can import only required functions from matplotlib.pyplot
It is always good to use function names instead of asterisk.
If we use asterisk to import from a particular module, all the functions will be imported.
It replaces some existing functions with the same name in the namespace.
Now we will add only required functions from numpy and matplotlib.pyplot
Let us save the file.
We will run the code again in the terminal.
Here, we got the plots for x, -x, sin of x and xsin of x in a single figure.
In this method we imported all the required functions to the current namespace.
There is another way of fixing errors. Let us see that.
Open the file another underscore fix.py
This file is also available in the Code files link of this tutorial.
Notice that we are going to use the name plt instead of matplotlib.pyplot.
plt is used as alias to the module matplotlib.pyplot
Now, we use numpy.pi instead of just pi as we did in four underscore plot.py.
Plot functions are called as
The advantage is that function names in imported modules do not get added to the current namespace.
In order to use a function in an imported module, we need to mention module-name.function-name
Pause the video here.Try this exercise and then resume the video.
Write a python script to plot a sine wave from -2pi to 2pi.
Open the file sine.py for the solution. This file is also available in the Code files link. In the first line we import the required functions.
The functions linspace, sin and constant pi are imported from the module numpy.
We import the functions plot, legend, show, title, xlabel and ylabel from matplotlib.pyplot.
And the rest of the code is to generate the plot.
Let us run the code and see the output.
In the terminal, type python3 sine.py
Now we can see our sine plot. Close the terminal.Let us move further in our topic.
We can run Python scripts in IPython interpreter also.
Open another terminal and start the ipython interpreter by typing ipython3
Navigate to the directory where four underscore plot.py is saved and type percentage run four underscore plot.py
As before we can see the output with 4 plots.
Python has a very rich standard library of modules.
Some of the standard modules are,
Few more libraries
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
Import only the required functions from modules by specifying the function name
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
2. Functions xlim() and ylim() can be imported to the current namespace as, from matplotlib.pyplot import xlim, ylim

This completes the installation demo for Windows OS.
Some important things to know about Audacity.
By default, Audacity will export the audio files in few formats like ogg, mp3, etc.
A plugin called "Lame" is needed in Audacity, to export into mp3 format in Windows OS.
Audacity also uses the "FFmpeg" plugin to be able to read/import mp4 files, in Windows OS.
Now let us learn about the Lame installation.
Lame is a library that allows some programs to encode mp3 files.
Here is the web page.
Scroll down a little bit.
Locate "TO DOWNLOAD Lame and FFmpeg for Windows, click links BELOW",
We will use the RECOMMENDED Installer Package for Windows:
Save the file on your computer.
In my system, it is saved in Downloads folder, by default.
Let me go to the Downloads folder.
Double-click "Lame_v3.99.3_ for_ Windows.exe" to launch it
Follow the setup instructions to install Lame for Audacity.
Make sure not to change the default installation location of this.
The default location would be C:\Program Files (x86)\Lame for Audacity".
You should now be able to export to mp3 format in Audacity in Windows OS.
Now we have the necessary setup to export our recordings to mp3 format.
Let’s move on.
FFmpeg libraries allow Audacity to import audio from video files.
To install FFmpeg library in Windows OS, visit this link
Here is the web page.
Scroll down a little bit.
Locate "TO DOWNLOAD Lame and FFmpeg for Windows, click links BELOW",
Directly below this, click the installer package FFmpeg-win-2.2.2.exe
Save the file on your computer.
In my system it is saved in Downloads folder, by default.
Go to the Downloads folder, double-click on FFmpeg-win-2.2.2.exe to launch the installer.
Another dialog box named Select Set up Language will appear.
Select English from the drop-down and then click on OK.
A Setup window will appear. Read the License.
For 64-bit version of Windows, the default location would be "C:\Program Files (x86)\FFmpeg for Audacity
Lastly click on Finish to exit the setup.
Let me show you a small demo of the same.
Note: I will import the audio from a video file named as What-is-a-Spoken-Tutorial.mov from my Desktop.
Then, click on Start Menu and type Audacity.
This will open an empty Audacity project on your screen.
On the Main menu, click on the File.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Editing Curves and Polygons in LibreOffice Draw.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to edit Curves and Polygons in Draw.
For this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of LibreOffice Draw. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit this website.
Here, we are using: Ubuntu Linux, version 10.04 and LibreOffice Suite, version 3.3.4.
Let us open our 'Routemap' drawing once again.
Previously, we learnt to draw curves and polygons. Now, let us learn how to edit them.
Let’s change the shape of the School Campus.
We will use the Edit Points toolbar to do this.
From the Main menu, click View, select Toolbars and click Edit Points.
The Edit Points toolbar is displayed.
Now, let us select the polygon School Campus.
Click the Points icon on the Edit Points tool bar.
In the object, the green selection handles will change to blue edit points. This indicates you are in the Edit point mode.
On the Edit Points toolbar, click on the Insert points icon.
Move to the Draw page. The cursor will turn into a plus sign.
Place this plus sign on the left side outline of the School Campus polygon.
Press the left mouse-button and drag it to the right. Release the button. You have inserted a point.
Now, click on the point that was inserted. The options in the Edit Points toolbar are enabled.
Click on Symmetric Transition.
The dotted control line appears next to the point.
Let’s drag the control line outwards to change the shape of the campus. The shape has changed!
To exit from the Edit Points toolbar, click Points.
Now, let’s elongate the campus to the right side.
Let’s specifically move only the last point on the top right.
Select the School Campus polygon.
Let’s enable the Edit Points toolbar.
The blue edit points appear on the object. Let us select this point.
On the Edit Points toolbar, click Move points.
You will see that the selected point becomes dark blue.
Now, let’s drag the point to the right.
We can use the grid to position objects as per our requirement.
We have changed the shape of the School Campus again!
Draw a curve and apply all the options from the Edit Points toolbar on it. Remember, you need a lot of practice to master the Edit Points toolbar.
Lastly, let us  group all the objects in the map. Press Ctrl + A key on the keyboard and right-click for the Context menu.
Now select Group. All the objects are grouped now.
The map is complete! You can also color the buildings; add roads using lines, add traffic signals and any other detail you require.
Here is our sample coloured routemap.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt how to edit Curves and Polygons.
Here is another assignment for you. Create the map shown on this slide.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Creating New Content Types.
Now that we know what are built-in Content types, let us create some custom Content types.
Recall the introduction to Content type.
We had learnt not to stuff everything into the body.
We are now going to learn how to create custom Content type.
We will create an Events Content type that tracks all the Drupal events around the world.
First, let us design on a paper what fields we need to capture for this Content type.
It is a good practice to do this for all new Content types before creating it in Drupal.
Create a table with columns for Field Name, Field Type, and Purpose.
All Drupal nodes have Title and Body fields defined, by default.
The Event Name can be the Title field to identify this event uniquely.
Event Description can be the Body field to provide some plain text description.
An Event Logo is an Image to display any special logo of the event.
We need a Event Date of type Date which captures the start and end date of the event.
The event can have a separate Event Website which is an URL link to be displayed in this Content type.
We will cover only these five fields in this tutorial. Later, we will learn to include two more fields.
Every event will be sponsored by an User Group. User Group is another Content type, we will create in the next tutorial.
Two nodes of two different Content types are linked in Drupal using the Entity Reference field.
An Event Topic is a Taxonomy field which is used to categorize the event under various keywords.
Now, let us click on Structure and then on Content types.
These are our 2 basic Content types.
Click the blue button Add content type.
We are going to call our new Content type as "Events".
And in the Description, we will type -"This is where we track all the Drupal events from around the world".
You can type any text that you want here.
This Description will appear on the Content type page.
You will also notice that Drupal gave it a Machine name. Here we can see it named as "events".
The Machine name is basically the name of the table in the database that Drupal assigns the content to.
In the Submission form settings, change the word Title to Event Name.
On the Publishing options, let's put a check-mark on Create new revision.
This means every time a node is edited, a new version will be created.
Leave the other settings as they are. Let's turn off the Display author and date information.
It's not important for this one. Here is something that is recommended for every Content type.
Click on Menu settings. Under Available menus, uncheck all the menus that might be checked.
This will prevent a content editor from adding a thousand events to our menu structure.
It ensures that others don’t have the permissions to add an event to our menu item.
If we want to add an event later on, we can do it manually ourselves.
Click on Save and manage fields.
Once our Events Content type is saved, we will see the Body field.
Click on Edit on the right hand side. And let's change the Label to "Event Description".
Click on Save settings button at the bottom.
We have just created our first Custom Content type in Drupal.
It is pretty limited at this point. Basically a Title and Body, which is the same as the basic page.
Next, we will add many more fields according to our paper design and make this a lot more helpful.
Click on Add field button at the top.
In Select a field type drop-down, choose Image. In the Label field, type "Event Logo".
Click Save and continue.
We can upload a default image here, if we want to, by clicking on the Choose file button.
We could also add default Alternative text, if we want to.
We will keep the limit as one logo for each event. Click Save field settings.
Now, we get to set up all the settings for the Event logo field.
Most of these are contextual and are based on the field type.
We can add some help text or some instructions here, for our content editors.
We can also check the box for Required field which means that a content item or node cannot be saved, until an event logo is added.
We can change the file extensions that are allowed here. It is recommended not to add bitmap here.
The file directory is filled in with a year and month, by default. But we can change this, if required.
For example, you may have several Content types with images.
Then, you can add a prefix events so that all the images of Events Content type will be in one file directory.
Drupal allows us to name it as anything that we want. But be careful with this because we can not change this very easily later.
We can also set the Maximum and Minimum image resolution and a Maximum upload size.
Think carefully before you make changes here. Imagine - you upload 2 or 3 megapixel images.
You use your wysiwyg editor. Shrink it down to a few hundred pixels.
Drupal still loads that 2 megapixel image and that can be really frustrating.
It gets worse if they are using their mobile. And on the data plan, suddenly you made them download 2 megabytes that they didn't need to download.
We must make sure that we are getting our images set properly before we upload them.
What's the largest size the image should be and what's the smallest size the image should be?
Minimum Image resolution, in particular, is very important.
This field should not be smaller than the largest image size that you want to display.
This will prevent Drupal from scaling the image beyond the original and making them pixelated.
Setup your Maximum Image resolution to, say, 1000 x 1000.
Setup your Minimum Image resolution to, say, 100 x 100.
Then make the Maximum upload size to 80 kb.
What Drupal will do is shrink the image down to a 1000 by 1000 size and make it 80 kilo bytes.
And, if it can't, then Drupal will reject the image.
It will be better to make this 600 by 600 pixels which is a more reasonable size.
We will check the Enable Alt field and Alt field required check-boxes.
Then click Save settings.
Now we have an Event Logo field for our Content type.
Let's add another field by clicking Add field.
In the Add a new field drop-down, choose Link. In Label field, let’s type "Event Website".
Click Save and continue.
Immediately, we are prompted to specify the Allowed number of values. We will just have 1 value for that.
Click Save Field Settings. Once again, this screen gives us the contextual settings for our Link field.
Under Allowed Link type, we have the options
Next, we can specify whether we are going to make Allow link text as Disabled, Optional or Required.
We will leave this as Optional for now and see how that works.
Go ahead and click Save settings. Once again click Add field.
This time we will choose the Date field.
Type the Label as "Event Date".
Click Save and continue.
We will leave the value at 1, for now. In the Date type drop-down, choose Date only option.
Click Save field settings. Once again we get the contextual settings page.
Here, let’s change the Default date to Current date.
Now, we have two more fields to add here but we cannot add them yet.
We will cover those in the upcoming tutorials. With this we come to the end of this tutorial.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about creating a new Content type and adding fields to Content type.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
Today, I would like to teach about selective sharpening.
Every digital image out of the camera needs to be sharpened because they are not crisp specially if you take raw images and don’t allow the processor in the camera to sharpen the image.
But, when you do it yourself by using the GIMP you can control the sharpening. And in today’s tutorial, I will show you how to do it.
Let’s have a look at this image, here.
In this image, the wire mesh in the background is the bit unsharpened area and the flower here is a bit sharpened.
So, I want to sharpen the flower a bit more and keep the background as it is.
But, first I want to show you why I don’t want  to sharpen the background.
It's unsharpened now and little bit of sharpening should not do any harm.
So, I select the Sharpen tool by clicking on the Filters in the tool bar and pull the Sharpness slider up and you can see that the originality of the background is destroyed.
But, if you look here and I take the Sharpen tool here and when I pull the slider to the extreme value, the picture dissolves.
So sharpening unsharpened areas or areas which are filled with color and no details, spoils the image. And this happens because the colours in the image which need no sharpening, get sharpened.
So, I’ll tell you the method of selectively sharpening which does not destroy the image.
To do selective sharpening, I will work with Layers.
This time, I simply make a copy of the Background layer and call it sharpen.
Now, I add a layer mask to the sharpen layer and I select the Grayscale copy of the layer as the layer mask and click on Add option and you see no change has happened because the Layer mode is Normal.
But, when I de-select the original Background layer, you can see that only the bright parts in the image are visible.
And if you remember, white in the layer mask reveals the bright parts and black hides and you can see here most of the layer mask is dark; so they are hidden and only the bright part here is visible.
Now when I use the sharpening algorithm on the layer mask, only the flower will be sharpened.
And I also want to sharpen the leaf part.
And in the sharpened image, I don’t want to have the white areas in the flower and I want only the fine details.
To do that, I use the 2nd filter and this is Edge-Detect.
This is the algorithm that helps for looking in the image, for the edges between bright and dull part and enhances them by making white line there.
You can leave these options, here, as they are because there is not much difference between these algorithms. But I increase the value of Amount to 4 and look in the Preview.
You can see here the background has a little bit of structure in it and in the brighter part there are thicker white lines.
I click on OK and wait for the algorithm to apply it to the image.
It works and now I get a white painting of all the edges.
I zoom into the image by pressing 1 and you can see here all the bright parts, now, have a white border and white line and all the other areas are nearly black.
When I switch off the layer mask and  the Background layer, you can see only the edge of the flower i.e the brighter part is visible.
Now I can sharpen the edge of the flower without affecting the colours in the background and the colour of the flower.
But, this would give a strange effect like a sharp line in a muddy background
And to avoid that I use another filter on this layer called Blur.
I select the layer mask and use Gaussian Blur to smash this white line a bit and I increase some value in Horizontal Blur Radius, say upto 8 and click on OK.
Wait for the completion of the filter and now you can see that the edge of the flower is a bit more softer. And I think I need a bit more contrast in the image .
So, I select the Curves tool and click into the image to get the curve and I pull the curve a bit down to get the dark darker and pull the bright part up and get the white whiter.
Click on OK and now I have thick white lines where there is a need for sharpening and black part where no sharpening should be done.
I could work on the black part but it will show no effect.
Now I disable the layer mask here and press Shift + Ctrl + E to look at the whole image.
Now you know Shift + Ctrl + E is to look at the whole image.
When I disable the original Background layer, I can see nearly nothing of the image.
Let me explain you what’s happening there by adding a new layer with a White Layer Fill Type and press OK.
Now you see the areas that need to be sharpened.
Now let’s sharpen this image. I click on Filters in the tool bar and Enhance and select Sharpen.
Go to the area of the flower where sharpening is to be done and see to it the sharpen layer is selected because there is nothing to sharpen in the white layer.
So, select sharpen layer, then filter and Re-Show 'sharpen' and here you see the flower. And now I can pull the Sharpness slider up till I get a good sharpened image.
And then press on OK and wait for the algorithm to work.
It works.
And now you can see that the line has more definition.
Let's switch this white layer off and see the full image.
Switch off the sharpen layer but no changes are visible in this magnification.
So, I zoom into the image.
And I think you should see the effect properly.
When I on the sharpen layer, you see the sharpened image and when I off it, the image is not sharpened.
With the help of the Opacity slider, I can control the amount of the effect.
Now, I check the background and you can see I have not harmed it.
Now I will do some fine tuning.
And I look in to the image for over-sharpened areas and the stuff which is not good enough sharpened.
The border between the flower and background is very well sharpened & with no add effects.
But when I go into the flower, this part looks a bit artificial and this part here is definitely over-sharpened.
And this flower bud here is not sharp enough because the edge detect algorithm found no edges.
But as you can see there are some edges and I should have given this part a bit more boost with the help of the Levels tool or with the Curves tool.
Sharpening should always be the last step in your work flow.
Ok. I’ll come back to that later.
Now I have to reduce the sharpness of this part.
It’s easy, just make sure that you have selected the sharpen layer. Choose the Brush tool.
Choose a brush with soft edges and make the brush large enough for this job by pulling the Scale slider and now select the black colour because you remember black hides & white reveals.
And pull the Opacity slider of your brush to say 20%.
When I move the brush here and start painting, you can see that the sharpening is reduced.
I can show you exactly what happens here with the help of layer mask.
I ON the layer mask and when I paint over the white part, it turns darker.
But when I turn off the layer mask, I can see the image and can see the result of my operation.
I will look into the details later.
Now I have to do more sharpening to this part here.
I just switch the colours with ‘x’ key and start painting.
And as you can see this part gets sharper and darker.
And I think this is quite good and to check my work I switch on the layer mask and you can see the white part is what I have painted and I have done it a bit over.
So, I go back to the layer and change the colour by pressing 'X' key and redo the work I have done.
We are working with the layers here; so there is no danger of losing any data.
The only thing that I can destroy now is the edge data that has been constructed by the filter.
But that can easily be redone .
Here, I have zoomed into the edge of the flower where the sharpening has to be done.
And as you can see, the edge is sharpened here.
The sharpening helps in getting a bright and dark line between the dark and the bright part of the border, between these 2 colours.
The edge of dark part is darkened and bright part is brightened.
And by using the mask, you can keep the effect only to the area you want to have it.
Let me point you to more detailed resource about sharpening.
Go to "tips from the top floor.(dot)com"- the site of Chris Markwa’s broadcast. And there on the left side, you will find somewhere a Photoshop Corner.
And there he has lot of broadcast about Photoshop which nearly are usable for GIMP too. And he has made the effort as writing stuff he says in the broadcast and made some picture of it. And I’ll take some material from there, so I can point  directly to the source here.
And here you can see about the sharpening effect about which I discussed in this tutorial.
He also covers the Unsharp mask and the process to avoid the halos in detail
and shows lot of different techniques to sharpen the image.
But the one I showed you is not here on this site.
And, by the way, when you are on this site just check out if there are still some places on learning to see workshop.
This was it for this week. If you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org.
More information is available at
And I would like to hear from you.
Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better, what you want to see in the future.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Drupal Site Management.
What is Site management?
Observing and fixing errors
Open our website which we created earlier.
The starting point of site management is the Reports menu. If you need additional assistance, you can also consult the Help menu.
Click on Reports. We see a list of the reports that we can get on our Drupal site.
Click on Available Updates.
If anything is in red background, that means there is a security update and we should update it soon.
If it is in yellow, then it is not a security update but there is an improved version available.
On the Settings tab, we can tell Drupal how frequently to check for updates.
We can also tell it to send an e-mail to us, if there are updates available. It is highly recommended to do this.
Under Reports, the "Recent log messages" gives us a list of errors found by Drupal. We should look at these, once in a while.
Under Reports, the Status report shows installation or configuration problems recognized by Drupal.
For instance -
Under Reports, the Top 'access denied' errors and Top 'page not found' errors are also important.
These are simple ways to make sure that our site is performing the best it can.
Top search phrases provides the frequently used words in the search forms of your site.
Understanding the reporting section of our Drupal website is the first step in maintaining our site.
Next, let us learn to update Drupal.
Click on Available updates.
We see that the current version of Drupal core is 8.1.0 and the recommended version is 8.1.6.
This is the status at the time of the recording.
You may see a different recommended version here.
Note that you need an internet connection for Drupal to find out the current recommended version.
Updating Drupal core requires manual downloading of code files and applying it to your site.
We will see the upgrading process step by step.
The following steps are applicable to Bitnami Drupal stack.
But most of the steps are applicable to any other Drupal installation, as well.
Step No 1:
For that, go to Configuration and click on Maintenance mode under Development.
Check the option to "Put site into maintenance mode".
Click on Save configuration button.
When the Maintenance mode is active, only administrators can login.
In case you logged out admin by mistake, you can login at the URL of your homepage followed by /user.
Others will see a message that the site is under maintenance.
Step No 2:
Open your Bitnami Drupal Stack control window.
Refer the tutorial Installation of Drupal to recollect how to open this control window.
Click on Open PhpMyAdmin button.
We are redirected to the phpmyadmin page.
The default username is root.
Drupal admin password and phpmyadmin password both are the same.
So, type the username as root and type your Drupal admin password, then click on Go button.
To take a backup, first click on Export button at the top panel.
Select bitnami_drupal8 under the Database list.
Under the Output section, give the filename template as "drupal-8.1.0" and set the Compression as gzipped.
The filename could be different based on your current version.
Under the section Object creation options, put a check-mark on Add DROP DATABASE statement option.
Put a check-mark on Add DROP TABLE option.
Go to your Downloads folder and check for the backup file "drupal-8.1.0.sql.gz".
Step No 3:
To stop all the running servers, switch to the Bitnami Drupal Stack control window.
Click on the Manage Servers tab and then click on the Stop All button.
Step No 4:
This will open in the file browser.
Navigate to the folders apps, then drupal and finally htdocs.
Step No 5:
Name this folder with the current version number.
Next, move the backup database file to the drupal-8.1.0 folder.
Step No 6:
Next, move the folders core and vendor and all the other files by cut and pasting into the backup folder drupal-8.1.0.
This will keep both the database and the code in one place.
This is a backup copy of the old version of the core, in case you have to revert back.
Step No 7:
Next, we have to download the latest version of Drupal.
Open your web browser and go to the link shown:
Download the latest recommended version of Drupal 8.
At the time of this recording, it is Drupal core 8.1.6.
This version could be different at the time of your viewing.
Click on it to open.
Click on the tar.gz or zip file to download.
Click on the OK button to save it.
Now, go to your Downloads folder and move the drupal zip file to your htdocs folder.
drupal-8.1.6.zip file is provided in the Code files link in the webpage of this tutorial.
If you don’t have internet connection, please download and use it.
Step No 8:
Double click on it to open.
From the new Drupal folder, move the folders core and vendor and all the other regular files to the htdocs folder.
Step No 9:
Now, go to Manage Servers tab and start all the servers by clicking on the Start All button.
Step No 10:
Go to Reports and Status report.
Here, we can confirm the Drupal version number and that it is the latest one.
But our database is out-of-date.
Every time there is a core, module or a theme update, the database has to be updated.
Step No 11:
Go to Extend menu and click on update script link.
Click on Continue button.
It says that we have some pending updates. For you, it may be different.
Click on Apply pending updates button.
Now click on Administration pages link.
If there are no errors, we have successfully updated the core.
Step No 12:
Remove the check-mark to Put site to maintenance mode option.
Click on Save configuration button.
This will bring back to the site to online mode for all the users.
The steps discussed so far, work for Bitnami installation.
If you have used other methods, most of the steps will be the same except for the Bitnami sections.
Now, let us learn to update themes and modules.
This is easy compared to the core update because Drupal will do this on a click of a button.
Sometimes we will have only modules or themes updates without any core update.
Step No 1:
Click on Update tab.
Here, we can see that we have to update a few themes and modules.
Select them all.
Then click on Download these updates button.
Make sure the check-box is ON for performing updates in maintenance mode.
Click on Continue button to apply the updates.
This will update the code and bring back thesite to online mode.
Step No 2:
If you have not backed up the database, do it as we did before.
Click on the Continue button.
This will update the database like we did for the core update.
Click on the Apply pending updates button.
Click on the Administration pages link.
Drupal will normally bring the site back to online mode.
If this is not the case, you will see an option at the top of the page to Go online.
Step No 3:
Click on Reports menu and Available updates.
Here we can see our Drupal core, Modules and Themes everything is up-to-date.
Next, let us learn how to revert our old version.
In case our update fails, for some reason you don’t know, we can go back to our previous version.
For this, we need to restore the old core and database.
Step No 1:
Step No 2:
Step No 3:
Move the folders core and vendor and other regular files into the drupal-8.1.6 folder.
Go back to the htdocs folder and open the previous version folder.
Then move the folders core and vendor and other regular files from drupal-8.1.0 to htdocs folder.
Step No 4:
Step No 5:
Open the phpMyAdmin page from the Drupal Stack Control window.
Click on the Import button at the top panel.
Click on the Browse button.
Here, choose the backup database file.
Then click on the Go button at the bottom.
Step No 6:
Switch to our Drupal site.
Click on Reports menu and Status report.
Here you can see that now our Drupal version is 8.1.0.
Note that we can revert only the core and database to the old version.
The modules and themes were updated by Drupal.
We did not make a copy of it in Step 6, so we will not see the old versions here.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about important aspects of Site management:

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Filing a Workpiece
In this tutorial, we will learn,
What is filing?
Various tools used for filing
Different types of filing
How to file a workpiece
And common mistakes while filing
For this tutorial we require
A file,  The workpiece to be filed
Bench Vice to hold the workpiece
Vernier Calliper to measure
Try Square to check the workpiece's squareness
Hack saw to cut the workpiece
Punch to mark on the workpiece
And a Ball pein hammer
First let's  see, what is filing.
Filing is a method of removing excess material from a job or a workpiece using a file.
There are various types of files for various requirements
Flat file, for rectangular cross-section
Smooth file : for getting smooth surfaces
Safe edge file : for filing the right angled part of the workpiece
Square file : for developing square corners & square holes
Half run file : for filing semi-spherical surfaces
And Round file : for developing holes & round groves.
Let’s us now learn the filing process.
My requirement is a 5 by 3 inch workpiece.
The job or the work-piece which I have is 5 by 4 inches.
So let us first cut the excess 1 inch part.
For this, apply the marking medium on the work-piece.
You can use a chalk or ink as a marking medium.
Once the medium is applied, mark the work-piece using a jenny calliper, as shown.
So, I am marking a little less than 1 inch according to my requirement.
Next, use a punch and ball pein hammer to punch on the marked line.
After this, place the work-piece parallel to the jaws of the Vice.
Now tighten it to hold the work-piece in place.
This is so that we can cut the work-piece easily.
Next, take the hack saw and cut the excess portion of the work-piece.
Once the excess part is removed, measure the work-piece once again.
Yes, the measurement is proper now. I have 5 by 3 inches .
Now, let’s start filing.
First we have to select a suitable file.
I need a smooth edge, so I will choose the Smooth file.
Make sure that the handle of the file is securely fitted.
Do not use a file without a proper handle.
You will end up injuring your hands.
Make sure that the file is clean before you start filing.
Using rusted files will damage the work-piece as well as bruise your hands.
So, now I have selected the proper file.
Next step is to place the work-piece securely in the Bench vice once again.
Position yourself at 90 degree perpendicular to the Bench vice.
Place your left leg in the front & right leg at the back.
This is the best position for filing.
Now hold the handle of the file firmly in your right hand.
With your left hand, hold the tip of the file as shown.
Ensure that, the right thumb is pressing the handle of the file firmly.
Now we are ready to start filing.
There are three methods of filing. They are :
Straight forward filing
Draw filing
Diagonal or cross filing.
Let’s see them one by one.
Moving the file lengthwise across the surface of the work-piece is called Straight forward filing.
In this method, the filing is done by moving the file up & down slowly.
You can see that your work-piece is getting filed and the excess material is being removed.
In Draw filing method, the file is pulled towards the body with an even pressure.
In Diagonal filing method, the file is moved diagonally over the surface of the work-piece.
The movement of the file is from one corner of the work-piece to another, diagonally.
Once the filing is done, we have to check the flatness & squareness of the work-piece surface.
This is done with the help of Try-Square & Vernier calliper.
To check whether the flatness is proper, place the Try-square on the work-piece as shown.
Do so at 3 different places on the work-piece.
Check this against a light source.
This is a clear indication of flatness.
If the surface is uneven, then you will see light rays between the work-piece and the Try-square.
In such cases, you will need to file again.
Next we will check the squareness of the work-piece by using the Try-square.
Keep the Try-square on the corner of the work-piece, as shown.
Now touch the edges of the Try-square on two adjacent sides of the work-piece, like this.
Check whether the adjacent sides of the work-piece are at 90 degrees to each other.
If not, then file again.
Another measurement that we need to do is to check the thickness of the work-piece.
For this, we have to use a Vernier calliper.
Place the work-piece within the jaws of the Vernier calliper, as shown.
Measure the thickness of the work-piece.
Now repeat this at least on three different locations on the work-piece.
Identical measurement indicates that the work-piece is even in thickness.
Now its time to learn what not to do while filing.
Do not file a work-piece at an angle
Do not file a work-piece at both the edges skipping the centre.
Let us summarise, In this tutorial, we have learnt
To Measure a workpiece
Remove the excess part of the workpiece
File a workpiece

Welcome to this tutorial on Introduction to R Studio.
In this tutorial, you will learn about these features of Rstudio:
Source and Console windows
Workspace; Plots and Files window
How to install packages of R
To understand this tutorial, you should know:
Elementary Maths
Basic commands of R
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04
R version 3.2.3
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
The window in the top left corner is the Source window.
It is used to edit a script and run it.
The window in the bottom left corner is the Console window.
It is used to install packages or to run a particular command.
The upper right window is the Workspace window.
It stores all the variables used during execution of commands under the Environment tab.
Place your cursor on the inside edges of all the windows.
A four-headed arrow symbol appears.
You can drag this to resize your windows for better visibility.
Let us declare some variables.
In the Console, type testSample (capital S) space less than symbol followed by hyphen space c.
Now, in parentheses, type 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4.
Press Enter to execute this line.
You can see the variable testSample in the Environment window.
The lower right window is the Plots and Files window.
The Files tab is used to keep track of Working Directories.
We will learn more about Working Directory later in this series.
The Plots tab shows all the graphical output.
Let us plot the variable testSample.
In the Console, type plot testSample capital S in parentheses. Press Enter.
You can now see the plot in the Plots window.
Let us look at the Environment window in the upper right corner.
We will clear this variable in this window.
At the top of the Environment window, click on the broom icon.
A Confirm Remove Objects window appears.
Ensure that the box Include hidden objects is checked and click on Yes.
Now, there is no variable in the Environment.
Click in the Plots window and click on the broom icon.
A Clear Plots text box appears.
The text reads, “Are you sure you want to clear all of the plots in the history?”
Now, let us try plotting this variable again.
In the Console, again type plot testSample in parentheses as before.
No plot is generated.
Instead, we see:
Error in plot(testSample) : object 'testSample' not found
It means that the variable testSample has been removed from our Workspace.
So, you should be careful with this broom icon in the Environment window.
Next to Environment, the History tab stores all our actions.
Here, we can see the lines that have been executed so far.
Let us declare two variables, firstVar and secondVar, which will be used later.
In the Console, type first capital V a r space less than symbol followed by hyphen space 6.
Next, type second capital V a r space less than symbol followed by hyphen space 8.  Press Enter.
Our Console window is filled with the previous commands.
We need to clean the Console before moving on.
Click in the Console window and press Ctrl+L together.
Clicking on the broom icon in the upper right corner of the Console will also clear it.
To see this icon, place the cursor under the maximizer button of the Console window.
You will see a hand symbol and the text, Clear Console Ctrl+L.
Packages in R
R packages are a collection of R functions, compiled code and sample data.
Stored under a directory called library in the R environment.
By default, R installs a set of packages
Let us switch back to RStudio.
Now click on the Environment tab again.
To see the list of R packages installed in your system, in the Console, type library parentheses.
A tab named R packages available opens up in Source window.
Let us install a new package named MASS.
Please make sure that you are connected to the Internet.
In the Console window, type install dot packages.
Now, MASS inside double quotes in parentheses.
We will need to wait until R installs the package.
There is another way to install a package. Let us install another package named ggplot2.
In the top menu bar of RStudio, click on the Tools button.
From the drop-down menu, select the Install Packages option.
In the Packages field, type the name of the package ggplot2
Ensure that Install dependencies box is checked and click on the Install button.
To load a package, we use library function and provide the package name as an argument.
We will load the MASS package now.
In the Console window, type library MASS in parentheses and press Enter.
Now we will use fractions function available in the MASS package.
In the Console window, type f r a c t.
RStudio shows the fractions option.
Press Enter to select it.
You can use this feature while typing commands.
Only remember that R is case-sensitive.
After fractions, type, in parentheses, firstVar division slash secondVar.
You can see the reduced fraction ¾ in the Console.
In the Console, we can also type firstVar division slash secondVar.
It gives the result in decimal form.
We have learnt about, Source and Console windows. Source and Console windows

This tutorial is about the properties window in Blender 2.59.
This script has been contributed by Sneha Deorukhkar and Bhanu Prakash and edited by Monisha Banerjee.
what are the scene panel, world panel and Object panel under the Properties window;
what are the various settings in the scene panel, world panel and Object panel under the Properties window.
We have already seen the first panel of the 'Properties window' and the settings in the previous tutorial.
Let's see the next panels in the Properties window.
First, we must resize our Properties window for better viewing and understanding.
Left-click the  left edge  of the Properties window, hold and drag to the left.
We can see the  options  in the Properties window more clearly now.
To learn how to resize the Blender windows, see our tutorial - How to Change Window Types in Blender.
Left click the  second  icon at the top row of the Properties window. This is the Scene panel.
Camera is the active camera used for rendering the scene.
Units determines the scale of the objects in the scene.
This is very useful and important for animating in Blender.
By default, Units is set to None and Degrees.
Left click Metric . Now all objects in our scene will be measured in metres.
Take a look at Gravity.
Notice that the X-Y-Z units of gravity have changed to metres per second square
Gravity comes in use when we animate objects using Physics in Blender.
We shall see that in later tutorials.
Left click the third  icon at the top row of the Properties window.
This is the World panel. Here, we can change the world settings or background settings of Blender.
Left click Blend Sky. The Preview changes to  gradient colour.
But the 3D view looks the same. So, how do we know that the background has actually changed?
Now, we can see the change in the background.
Close the Render Display.
Left click   Zenith colour. Choose a colour from the menu. I am selecting white.
Now, the background will be rendered with a black and white gradient.
Other settings in the World panel are - Ambient Occlusion, Environment Lighting, Indirect Lighting, Gather, Mist, Stars.
These settings will be covered in more advanced tutorials about lighting in Blender.
Left-click the fourth icon at the top row of the 'Properties window'.
This is the Object Panel. Here are the settings for the active object.
By default, the Cube is the active object. So, all the settings here are for the cube.
Transform determines the location, rotation and scale of the active object.
Left click X 0 under Location. Type 1 on your keyboard and press Enter.
The cube moves forward by 1 unit on the X-axis.
So, this is how we can use the Object panel to move, rotate and scale the active object.
This is very useful while animating key-frames in Blender.
Right click Camera in the 3D-view.
Notice how the units for Location, Rotation and Scale under Transform in the 'Object Panel' have changed.
These are the settings for the selected camera.
Next setting is Relations. Here, we can specify the Layer and Parent  for an active object.
Left click the second square under Layers. The camera is now hidden.
In fact, it has been moved to the second  layer. Since the layer is hidden, the camera gets hidden too.
Go to View at the bottom left corner of the 3D-view. Left-click to open the menu.
Select Show All Layers. The camera can be seen again in the 3D-view.
Layers is very useful when working with multiple objects in one scene.
Left click Parent   under Relations in the 'Object Panel'.
Parent is the most important animation tool used in all 3D- animation softwares.
We will use this a lot in the Blender Animation tutorials.
Select Cube.
The Camera has been parented to the cube.
The cube is the parent object and the camera is the child object. Let's see what this means.
Right-click to select the cube in the 3D-view.
Left click the blue handle, hold and move your mouse up and down.
The camera moves up and down along with the cube.
Left click on screen to confirm a new location for the cube.
Right click Camera in the 3D-view. Now, go back to Parent in the Object Panel.
Left click Parent. Press Backspace on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
The camera is no longer parented to the cube.
It snaps back to its original position in the 3D-view while the cube remains in the new position.
This means that parenting does not change the original transform settings of the child object.
So, in this tutorial we have covered Scene panel, World panel and Object panel under the Properties window.
The rest of the panels shall be covered in the next tutorial.
Now, go ahead and create a new Blend file. Change Scene units to Metric.
Change World colour to Blend Sky, Red and black.

Welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Logical & Other Operators.
Logical Operators
Parallel assignment and
Range Operators .
Ubuntu Linux version 12.04
To follow this tutorial, you must know how to use  Terminal and Text editor in Linux.
You must also be familiar with 'irb'.
Logical operators are also known as  Boolean operators
because they evaluate parts of an expression
and return a  true or  false value.
Logical Operators are-
double ampersand (&&) that is and
double pipe  that is or
Exclamation mark (!) that is not.
'&&' (double ampersand) and and evaluate to true only if both the expressions are true.
Second expression is evaluated only if the first is true.
Difference in the two forms is precedence.
Symbolic and  that is&&(double ampersand) has higher precedence.
Let's see some examples now.
We will use irb for this.
Open the  terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously.
Type "irb" and press Enter to launch interactive Ruby.
Type:  3 greater than 2 space double ampersand space 4 less than 5.
Press  Enter.
We get the output as "true".
Here, expression1 that is 3>2 is true.
Expression 2 that is 4<5 is also true.
Since both the expressions are true, we get output as true.
Now, press Up-Arrow key to get the previous command.
And replace the double ampersand symbol with the word "and".
We get the same result.
Now, press up-arrow key again to get the previous command.
In  expression1, replace greater-than sign with less-than,
press  Enter
We get the output as "false".
This is because  3 < 2 is false.
Since the first expression is false, the second expression will not be evaluated.
So, we get the output as "false".
double pipe and or evaluate to true, if either expression is true.
Second expression is evaluated only if first is false.
Difference in the two forms is precedence.
Symbolic or i.e double pipe has higher precedence.
Now, let's try some examples.
Type: 10 greater than 6 space double pipe space 12 less than 7
Press  Enter.
We get output as "true".
Here expression 1, that is 10>6, is true.
Since the first expression is true, second expression will not be evaluated.
So, we get the output as true.
Now, press the Up-Arrow key to get the previous command.
In expression 1 replace greater than sign with less than sign
and replace pipe symbol with the word or.
Here, expression1 that is 10<6 is false.
Expression 2 that is 12<7 is also false.
Since both the expressions are false, we get output as "false".
'!' (exclamation mark ) and not operators return the opposite value of the expression.
If the expression is true, exclamation mark operator will return a false value.
It will return true if the expression is false.
Difference in the two forms is precedence.
Symbolic not, that is '!', has higher precedence.
Let's try out the "not" operator.
First, type: 10 double equal to 10
Press Enter .
We get the output as "true".
To invert the result of above expression,
let's add the "not" operator before the expression.
Type: exclamation mark within brackets 10 double equal to 10 .
We get the output as "false".
Press Ctrl+L simultaneously to clear the irb console.
Next, let us learn about parallel assignment.
Multiple variables can be initialized with a single line of Ruby code, through parallel assignment.
Let's switch to the terminal.
Let's declare three variables 'a', 'b', 'c' using parallel assignment.
Type: a comma b comma c equal to 10 comma 20 comma 30
Here, 10 will be assigned to variable 'a',
20 will be assigned to variable 'b'
30 will be assigned to variable 'c'.
The right-hand side acts as an array.
If we list multiple variables on the left hand side then the array is unpacked and assigned into the respective variables.
We will learn about arrays in detail, in the upcoming tutorials.
For now, let's check whether the assignment is done properly.
Type 'a' and press Enter.
Value 10, stored in variable 'a', is displayed.
Type 'b' and press Enter.
We get 20.
Type 'c' and press Enter.
30 is displayed.
Parallel assignment is also useful for swapping the values stored in two variables.
Let us swap the values of variables 'a' and 'b'.
Type: puts space within double quotes a equal to hash within curly brackets a comma within double quotes b equal to hash within curly brackets b
We get the output as a=10
b=20.
Now, let's swap 'a' and 'b'.
To do so, type:
a comma b equal to b comma a
Press Up-Arrow key twice to get the puts command and press Enter.
We get the output as-
a=20
b=10 .
We will now learn about range in Ruby.
The values in a range can be numbers, characters, strings or objects.
Ranges are used to express a sequence.
Sequence range is used to create a range of successive values.
It consists of a start value, range of values and an end value.
(..) two dot operator creates  inclusive range.
(...) three dot operator creates an exclusive range.
Ranges are used to identify whether a value falls within a particular range too.
We do this using (===) the equality operator.
Let us try out some examples on ranges.
Let's switch to terminal.
Type: within brackets  1 two dots 10 then dot to underscore a
Two dot operator creates inclusive range.
Inclusive operator includes both, begin and end values, in a range.
Here to_a method is used to convert a range to a list.
Here, you can see the values 1 and 10 are included in the range.
Now, we will see an exclusive range operator.
Type:  within brackets 1 three dots 10 then dot to underscore a.
Three dot operator creates an exclusive range.
Exclusive range operator excludes the end value from the sequence.
Here, the end value 10 is not included in the range.
Now, let's check whether 5 lies in the range of 1 to 10.
Type: within brackets 1 two dots 10 three times equal to and then 5.
Equality operator is used to check whether a value lies in the range.
We get the output as "true" since 5 lies in the range 1 to 10.
Logical operator i.e double ampersand, double pipe and exclamation mark operators.
Parallel assignment Ex: a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
Range Operator- Inclusive operator (..) and Exclusive operator(...).
declare two variables using parallel assignment and
check whether their sum lies between 20 and 50.

In this tutorial we will learn
The Art of Asking Questions
Now the Promoter can open the sales call.
The second way to handle reservations is by suggesting products with a lower price.
Customers who frown or seem to be puzzled., may be indicating they aren’t thoroughly sold on the merchandise.
Resisting a Store Promoter’s attempt to move merchandise out of the way.
and the buyer makes a firm commitment to the transaction.
Closing the sale should be a natural ending of the sales process.
Now phrase the“closing question”:
Providing “above and beyond” service.
Effective Sales Promoters suggest additional items before the sales transaction is completed.
Assure the customer that the add-on items are really helpful items.
After billing, hand-over the product in its casing along with all the add-on items to the customer...with a smile!
With this will come to the end of the tutorial
Influnce the customer to buy the product and addon items

This tutorial is contributed by Snehalatha Kaliappan and Madhuri Ganapathi from IIT-Bombay.
Welcome to the "Spoken Tutorial" on how to create a user registration form and how to register an user into "MySQL" database.
One suggestion before starting this tutorial is that you watch my User login tutorials first. I've posted a link to it.
I would suggest that you do so before going through these tutorials. The reason I have created User login before User registration is because I find it a lot easier to do the "User login" process before doing the "Registration" process.
Once you've got the "login" process right and you've got the fields in the database you can start our registration process.
I just find it a lot more easier to this way as you know what you're registering in to your database.
To start with, in the first part we will create our form and check for the existence of my 'login' information.
From my existing tutorials, I am using my "login session" folder.
This, here, is my "login session" folder and all my fields; but here I will create a new file.
Just add some tags first.
I will create this inside my "login session" folder with the "index dot php" which is the main page you saw.
"log in", "log out" and the "member" page if users are logged in and I will save this as "register dot php".
I am creating a user registration form so that the user can register before they decide to login.
I have created my "register dot php" and I am also going to open my "index" file. I will create a link underneath the form.
And this is going to be just a link to that register page and I will type "Register" here.
So what we get here is a link called "Register" which goes to our page where we have nothing at the moment.
Following from the last tutorial where we could login, I will just put a link to a page that you can register before you do this.
Before we were just typing data into our database, if I open up a new window, I will go across to "php my admin".
And this is the database that will be used called "php login" and this is my "users" table.
You can see I have added an extra field called "name" and I will add another field called "date".
At the end of the table that's going to be called "date" and it will be in DATE format.  So where is it?  Um.... here it is.
Before you get confused about what the date will be, it will be the current date when the users registered and we go there and save that.
So, from the last tutorial on the "User login" we just have "id", "username" and "password". Now I have added a "name" so its going to be the username and we've added "date", the date when he registered.
Just Browse in here. We have got a couple of values here already.
I will delete these because I am registering my users. So I can start from a clean database.
Assuming I have got no users at all and I have got my link here to the register page, here is my register page.
Now I'll briefly explain this html code which tells you how to create this page and we will have a form first of all.
This is going to be a self submitting form. It's going to submit back to "register dot php".
And we are going to create a table and inside this we will have a row here.
Then we have two columns, so two "td" blocks here and the 1st one will have, say- "Your full name:".
I will leave it up to you.  Just to speed up, I will do it this way.
In our second column here, I will put my input type as "text" and my name equals "fullname".
So you can see at the moment, let me go back to my original page, click on Register.
You can see, this is one column here, split down here. This is another column with the 'input box' in.
And I will also go up here and inside the php code, I will echo out a header.  I will explain a bit later why I have done this.
So we have got that.  At the moment we have this. To speed up, I will just copy and paste this down.
So you can make sure, you choose from "t r" till "end t r".
I will paste it down and then I will say "Choose a username:" so, obviously I will change this to "username".
I will paste that again and say "Choose a password:".  This text is just to secure in case any one's looking over our users' shoulder or any screen capture software being used to infiltrate this computer.
And the next one down here, I will just copy and paste this here to say "Repeat your password:".
Again "password" here.
We can't say "password" again; so I will call this "repeat password".
We will use this to compare the passwords once they have been submitted, as a safety measure, in case the user has made any mistakes.
And we don't need any other field. That is the last one.
What we do need is the "date". But I will do that when I submit the form.
Okay, so this is our form created. Let's go back and refresh.
You can see how this is evenly arranged, that's why we have used a table.
We need a "submit" button also.
Underneath our table, I will create a 'paragraph break'.
And my input type here is going to be "submit"; my name is going to be "submit".
And we have to check the existence and the value will just be "Register".
Let's refresh. There we are, you can see that the password fields have been blanked out.
Also we have a "full name" and "username' there for the users to type their values.
Okay, that's about it.  I will stop the tutorial here.
If you are following this step by step, make sure you have got your form written out and try out another design if you wish.
I wish I had more time to do it. So, go ahead and create your form as you want.
Do anything you want, change these labels.
Just make sure you got your boxes and your register.
In the next part, we will talk about checking that the user has typed each one of these fields in.
We will compare the passwords to see if they match. I mean, if I say there are two passwords and these don't match as they differ in character lengths, then the user can't register as they might have made a mistake.
I am sure most of you watching must have registered at some point and would have typed in your password again.
We will also encrypt our passwords and remove any dangerous html tags from these forms. So we'll have some bit of security to our registration form.
So I see in the next part. Thanks for watching. This is Sidhartha, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Loops in C and C++.
for loop,while loop and
do…while loop.  We will do this with the help of some examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
Let us start with the introduction to loops.
Loops are used to execute a group of instructions repeatedly.
Depending on the purpose they are divided into three types:
while loop  do…..while loop and
for loop Let us start with the while loop first.
A while loop tests the condition in the beginning.
The structure is: while ( condition )
within the bracket statement block.
Now move on to  do….while loop .
A do..while loop is executed at least once before the condition could be validated.
The structure is:
do (within the brackets) statement block,
after the bracket the while ( condition ).
You can see that the condition is checked at the end.
Now,let us see an example on while loop and do...while loop .
Note that our file name is while.c..
Today we are going to learn addition of first 10 numbers using while loop.
Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables x and y and initialized to 0.
This is our while loop.
The condition of the while loop is x is less than or equal to 10.
Here the value of x is added to the value of y.
The value obtained after the addition is stored in y.
Then we print the value of y.
Here  x is incremented.
That means the variable x is increased by one.
Now,let us execute the program.
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Type gcc space while dot c space hyphen o space while
Type   ./while  (dot slash while). Press Enter.
Now lets us see the working of  while loop.
Let me resize the window.
Here, first the  value of  x  and  y  is 0.
This is our  while  condition.
Here we check whether x is less than or equal to 10 which means the values of x will be from 0 to 10.
Then we add y plus x (i.e) 0 plus 0, we get 0.
We print the value of y, here we get 0.
Then x is incremented which means now the value of x will be 1.
Then we  will check the condition again, 1 is less than or equal to 10. If the condition is  true  then we will add the values,
y (i.e ) 0 plus x that is 1. 0 plus 1 is 1.
We print the value as 1.
Again x is incremented.
Now the value of x is 2.
We check the condition again.
2 is less than or equal to 10, if the condition is  true  then we will add the values, (i.e ) 1 plus 2 which will give 3.
We print the value as 3.
Like this, it will go on up to x is less than or equal to 10 (x<=10).
Now, we will see the same program using  do….while loop  .
Here is our program.
Note that our file name is  do hyphen while dot c .
This part is already explained in the previous program.
So, let us move on to a  do...while loop .
Here, first the body of the loop will be executed  and then the condition is checked.
The value of x is added to the value of y and the value obtained after the addition is stored in y.
The logic is same as in  while  program.
Type  gcc space do hyphen while dot c space hyphen o space do . Press  Enter .
Type  dot slash do (./do). Press Enter .
We can see that the output is similar  to our  while  program.
Now, let us see the working of  do...while loop .
Let me resize the window.
Here the value x and y is 0.
We add those values. Then we will get 0.
Now the value of y is 0.
We print the value as 0.
Then x is incremented by 1 which means now the value of x is 1, then the condition will be checked.
You can see that the body of loop is executed first.
Anyhow, if the condition is  false  then also we will get a value that is 0.
Now, here we will check whether 1 is less than or equal to 10.
The condition is true. Again we will add the values.
Now 0 plus 1.
Then we will print the value of y as 1.
Again x will be incremented.
Now the value of x is 2.
Then we check 2 is  less than or equal to 10.
We will go back here.
Then we will add the values. 1 plus 2 is 3.
We print the value of y as 3.
Like this, the conditions will be checked till the value of x will be less than or equal to 10.
Note that here the while condition ends with the semicolon.
In while loop the condition does not end with the semicolon.
Now let us see how to execute these programs in C++.
This is our while program in C++.
The logic and implementation are same as in our C program.
There are a few changes like the header file as iostream in place of stdio.h.
We have included the 'using' statement here using namespace std and here we have used the cout function in place of  printf  function.
The structure of  while loop is same as in our C program.
Lets us execute the program.
Come back to a terminal.
To execute, type   g++ space while dot cpp space hyphen o space while1 . Press Enter .
Type  dot slash while1 (./while1). Press  Enter .
You can see that the output is similar to our while program in C.
Now let us see the  do... while  program in C++.
Come back to the text editor.
Here also there are similar changes like the  header file , the  using statement  and the  cout  function.
Rest of the things are similar.
Lets us execute the program.
Type  g++ space do hyphen while dot cpp space hyphen o space do1 . Press  Enter .
Type  dot slash do1 (./do1). Press  Enter .
We can see that the output is similar to our  do...while program in C.
Now we will see some common errors and their solutions.
Suppose, here I will not increment the value of x.
Click on Save Let us see what happens.
Come back to the terminal Let me clear the prompt.
Lets us execute the program.
Press the up-arrow key twice.
Again press the up-arrow key.
We can see number of zeros, this is because the loop does not have the terminating condition .
It is known as  infinite loop.
Infinite loop  can cause the system to become unresponsive.
It causes the program to consume all the  processors  time  but it can be terminated.
Come back to our program, let us fix the error.
Type  x++  and a semicolon.
Click on Save. Let us execute again.
Come back to terminal.
Yes, it is working.
We will move back to our slides.
In this tutorial we learned,
while loop   example. while(x is less than or equal to 10)
do….while loop  .
example. do statement block and
while condition at the end.
write a program to print the following, using for loops.
0 to 9.
The syntax of the  for loop  is
for (variable initialization; variable condition; and variable increment or decrement)
and here will be the body of the loop.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Mango Pattern for textile design” using Inkscape.
In this tutorial we will learn to create a Mango pattern, Draw using Pattern along Path
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.91
Select Bezier tool. On the Tool Controls bar, change the Mode to Create Spiro path and the Shape to Ellipse.
Now draw a mango type design in the canvas as demonstrated. It should look like a mango pattern.
Next select the Star tool.
Now draw a star on the canvas. Click on the Selector tool.
On the Tool controls bar, change the Width and Height to 30.
Change the color to red.
Next we have to create a row pattern of the star.
To do so, go to Edit menu, click on Clone and Create Tiled Clones.
Click on Reset.
Change the number of Rows to 1 and Columns to 46.
Number of Columns may vary according to the size of the mango shape.
Click on Create.  Now the row pattern is created.
Select all the stars and press Ctrl + G to group them.
Now select both the mango shape and the star patten.
Go to Extensions, click on Generate from Path and then on Pattern along Path.
Click on Apply and close the dialog box.
Observe star pattern is formed on the shape.
Now select the mango shape and the star row and delete them.
Select the star pattern and press Ctrl + D to duplicate it.
Now select the duplicated pattern and resize it by pressing Ctrl key.
Keep it in the middle of the original pattern.
Let us now fill the empty area inside the mango pattern with another design.
Select the Bezier tool. Draw a design as demonstrated.
Now go to Path menu. Select Path Effects.
Under Pattern along Path, we can find many options.
In Pattern source, click on the 1st option, that is Edit on-canvas.
Observe there are 4 nodes created on the top left of the canvas.
Let me zoom in to see the nodes clearly. Move it near the pattern.
Now click on the nodes and drag. Now observe the change in the shape.
Click on the Selector tool.  Now go to Path menu and click on Object to Path.
This is done to avoid any change in the shape, while resizing.
Resize the pattern as shown. Duplicate it and place inside the Mango pattern.
Next let us fill the empty area inside the smaller mango pattern.
Click on the Star tool and draw a star.
Click on the inner handle and recreate a shape like this. Change the color to blue.
Click on the Selector tool and resize the shape.
Duplicate this shape and fill the smaller mango pattern.
Press Ctrl + A to select all the objects. And press Ctrl + G to group them.
Resize the pattern and place it on the top left of the canvas.
We can repeat this pattern using cloning. Go to Edit menu. Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled clones.
Under the Symmetry tab, the mode should be Simple translation.
Change the number of rows to 8 and number of columns to 5.
Click on Shift tab. Change the Shift X value of Per column to 30.

Create a report. Select, Label and Sort the report fields.
Select report layout and choose report type: static or dynamic.
Here, we have stored information about books and members in this Library database.
We also have a table to track the books issued to the members.
We learnt how to create forms and queries in the previous tutorials.
Before learning how to create a report, let us first learn what a report is?
A report is another way to retrieve information from a database, similar to a query.
We can customize its layout, look and feel so that it is easy to read or print on paper.
Reports can be generated from the database’s tables or queries.
They can also contain all the fields in the table or in the query or only a selected group of fields.
There are two categories of reports - static and dynamic.
Whenever a Static report is opened for viewing,
it will always display the same data which was there at the time the report was created.
This is also known as a snapshot.
But a Dynamic report will show current data from the database, whenever it is opened for viewing.
Okay, now, let us create a sample report.
On the right panel, let us click on ‘Use Wizard to create report’.
This is an easy and fast option to build reports.
We now see a new window which is also called the Report Builder window
and we also see a wizard with 6 steps listed on the left hand side.
We will go through the wizard to create a report based on a query we created in the last tutorial-
'History of books issued to the Library members’.
We are in Step 1 - Field Selection.
We will specify the source of the report data here: either a table or a query.
Let us choose our query: ‘History of Books Issued to Members’ from the drop-down list at the top.
Now we see a list of available fields from the query on the left hand side.
We want all the fields in our report; so we'll simply click on the double-arrow button towards the right.
Now let us click on the Next button to go to the next step.
Step 2. Labelling Fields.
Let us type the following descriptive labels in the label text-boxes as shown in the image.
Okay, let us click on the Next button now.
We are in Step 3 - Grouping.
This is used whenever we need to group the data by a set of selected fields.
For example- in our report, we can group the data by Book titles.
If we do that, then in the report we will see a book title and then all the members that it was issued to.
Then we will see the next book title, and so on.
For now, let us keep our report simple.
So, we will simply click on the Next button.
Now, we are in 'Step 4 - Sorting Options'.
Let us sort the data in chronological order.
And then sort it by the Book title in ascending order.
For this, we will click the Sort by drop-down box
and then click on Issue Date.
Then we will click on the second drop-down box
and then click on the Book Title.
Now, let us click on the Next button.
Okay. Step 5.- Choose Layout.
We can customize the look and feel of the report here.
Let us click on the ‘Columnar, single-column’ layout list.
Notice that the background Report Builder has refreshed.
It shows all the labels on the left and corresponding fields on the right.
Let us now click on the ‘Columnar, two columns’.
Again the window below has refreshed to show a two column layout.
In this way, we can choose any of the layouts that Base Wizard provides.
We can also modify it later as per our requirement.
For now, we will click on the first item- ‘Tabular’
and click on the Next button.
Okay, last step  - 'Create Report'.
Let us give a descriptive title to our report here: "Books Issued to Members: Report History".
Now let us design our report so that the report will always return the latest data from the database.
For this, let us click on the Dynamic Report option
as we would always like to see the latest data, whenever we open the report for viewing.
Okay, we are done with our Report. Let us click on the Create Report now option
and finally click on the Finish button.
Now we see a new window and this is the Report that we built just now.
Notice that it has the field labels at the top,  in bold font and the actual data is listed in a tabular fashion.
Also notice that it has been sorted by the Issue Date field in ascending order that is, chronologically and then by 'Book Title' in ascending order.
Thus we have created our chronological report of books issued to the Library members.
In the next tutorial, we will learn how to modify our report.
Create a report of all the books in the library grouped by their Publishers.
Both Publishers and Book titles need to be in ascending order.
Use the Columnar, Single-column layout.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Reports in LibreOffice Base.
Create a Report Select, Label and Sort the report fields
Select report layout And * choose report type: static or dynamic.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Sequences in GeoGebra.
In this tutorial we will learn to, Use spreadsheet view to create simple sequences
Use commands to create sequences and progressions
Divide the line segment into parts
Use Sequence command along with other commands
To record this tutorial, I am using;
GeoGebra version 5.0.438.0-d
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with GeoGebra interface.
For the prerequisite GeoGebra tutorials, please visit this website.
The commands used in the tutorial are provided in the Code Files link.
I have already opened GeoGebra interface.
We will first resize and place the Algebra view above the Graphics view.
Place the cursor on the Algebra views' title bar.
Click and drag the mouse.
When you see a rectangular outline, release the mouse.
Drag boundary to see the Graphics view clearly.
To create sequences, I will open the Spreadsheet view.
Click on View menu and select Spreasheet check-box.
Spreadsheet view opens next to the views.
Drag the boundary to see the Spreadsheet view clearly.
In the cell A1 type 2 and press Enter.
In the cell A2 type A1+2 and press Enter.
Now we will create a sequence of numbers using the formula entered in cell A2.
Place the cursor at the corner of cell A2 and drag the fill handle till cell A15.
Observe that, a sequence of even numbers is displayed in the cells.
Now we will create a list for this sequence.
Select the cells from A1 to A15 by dragging.
When we right-click on the selected cells, a context menu opens.
In the menu select Create and then List.
A list l1 is created in the Algebra view.
Drag the boundary of the Algebra view to see the complete list.
l1 contains a list of even numbers from 2 to 30.
Close the Spreadsheet view by clicking on the Close button.
We will rename l1 as Evens. In the Algebra view right-click on l1.
From the sub-menu, select Rename.
In the Rename text box, type Evens and click on the OK button.
We can create a similar sequence for odd numbers using the Sequence command.
In the Input bar type Odds=Sequence.
Select the option Sequence(<Expression>, <Variable>, <Start Value>, <End Value>).
Type the Expression as 2n+1.
To go to the next argument, press Tab key.
Press Tab key and type Start Value as 0.
Again press Tab key and type the End Value as 15.
Observe the sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 31 in the Algebra view.
We will use the Sequence command to show a series of points in the Graphics view.
In the Input bar type the following command.
This command draws points at (n,0) where n goes from 1 to 10.
Drag the Graphics view if you cannot see the points on the x-axis.
We see a series of points on the x-axis from 1 to 10.
Coordinates of the points are shown in the Algebra view.
Let us change the position of these points.
In the Algebra view double-click on the list L1.
The Redefine text box appears.
In the box change n comma zero to zero comma n and click on the OK button.
Observe that the points move to y-axis.
Note the changes in the list L1.
Using Zoom Out tool, click in the Graphics view to see all the points on the y-axis.
Again double-click on the list L1 in the Algebra view.
In the Redefine text box, change zero comma n to n comma n and click on the OK button.
Observe that the coordinates of the points change to n comma n.
Note the changes in the list L1.
We will now a draw line segment to join zero comma zero and n comma n
For this we will use the Segment command along with the Sequence command.
In the Input bar, type the following command and press Enter.
Observe that a line is drawn to join the points.
A new list l1 is generated in the Algebra view.
As as assignment:
We will create arithmetic progression (AP) and geometric progression (GP) using the Sequence command.
For more information on AP and GP, please see the Additional Material provided along with this tutorial.
I will open a new GeoGebra window.
In the Input bar, type the following command and press Enter.
Create Sliders dialog box appears.
Click on Create Sliders button.
Number sliders a, n and d are created in the Graphics view.
Observe that a new sequence AP is generated in the Algebra view.
Drag the boundary to see the Algebra view clearly.
This command has generated a series of numbers  a plus n minus 1 into d  .
Here  a and d go from -5 to 5.
Drag the  sliders a and d.
As we drag the sliders, observe the changes in the sequence AP.
Notice that, sequence AP does have not any representation in the Graphics view.
In the Input bar, type the following command and press Enter.
Observe that a list of points l1 is generated for the sequence AP.
Click on the Zoom Out tool and click in the Graphics view to see all the points.
Let us find the sum of n terms of the series.
In the Input bar, type the following command and press Enter.
Sum of n terms is displayed in the Algebra view.
Now type  a plus d x   and press Enter.
A line f of x is drawn to join the points of the sequence AP.
Again, drag sliders a and d to see the changes.
Now we will generate a geometric progression.
Let us delete all the objects from the views.
In the Input bar type, the following command and press Enter.
Create Sliders dialog box appears.
Click on Create Sliders button.
Sliders b, r and n are created in the Graphics view.
Drag the boundary to see the Algebra view clearly.
A new sequence GP is created in the Algebra view.
This sequence generates a geometric progression of numbers from 0 to 10.
Drag the sliders b and r to see the changes in the geometric progression.
Type the following Sequence command and press Enter.
A series of points from 0 to 10 are plotted in the first quadrant.
Now type b r raised to the power of x and press Enter.
Observe that a line is drawn to join the points.
Drag the sliders b and r to see the changes in the curve and points on the curve.
We see a plot of an exponential function g of x.
Now we will divide a line segment into parts using the Sequence command.
I have opened a new GeoGebra window.
Under Line, click on Segment with Given Length tool.
Segment with Given Length text box opens.
In the Length text box, type 10 and click OK.
Now we will create a number slider n.
Click on Slider tool and click in the Graphics view.
In the Slider dialog box, type Name as n.
Change Min to 1, Max to 10 and Increment as 1.
Then click on OK button in the box.
In the Input bar type the following command.
Using this command we are generating a series of points on the segment AB.
Here k goes from 1 to n-1.
Observe that k is expressed in terms of n, so we do not need a slider for k.
Drag the slider n and see the partitions in the segment AB.
Let us delete all the objects from the views.
We can use the Sequence command along with additional commands.
For example, type the following command and press Enter.
Using this command we have drawn concentric circles with origin at zero comma zero and radius r.
Here r goes from 0 to 5 in the increments of 0.25.
Let us delete l1.
Next type this command and press Enter.
Using this command we have drawn a family of parabolas x square + cx.
And generate sequences to draw parabolas.
Let us summarize
In this tutorial we have learnt to,  Use spreadsheet view to create simple sequences
Use commands to create sequences and progressions
Use sequence command along with other commands

Hi, welcome back. In this tutorial you will write some data into a database.
To do this we will use "mysql query" function.
Now you can see here that we have our... records.
I am redoing this tutorial because the first time I did it, it did not work.
So first of all, I will just delete this data here.
Well... ok... So we have a blank table, we have no data in our table whatsoever at the moment.
we can see that there is nothing in here.
There are just our field names here.
To begin with, in here, let's just comment this.
So, "write some data". Then we will set up a query that will write data.
So... "$write" and we will use "mysql-query()" function.
And this takes exactly 1 parameter which is our sql query.
To do this, we will type "INSERT" to insert data.
We are going to say "INSERT INTO".
Now the reason I've typed this in capitals is because it's sql code.
If I type anything in uppercase it means it is sql code.
If I type anything in lowercase it means its either a table name, database name or it is data that I'm writing to the database.
So, "INSERT INTO people" because that is our table name here.
"INSERT INTO people" and then "VALUES" and then in brackets we will create a little area  for each value.
So, we got 1,2,3,4,5.
There are 5 fields, so we need exactly 5 pieces of database written here.
We need the id, firstname, lastname, all the way down to gender.
These are created in or created using single quotes each separated by coma.
The reason we don't use double quotes is because we've got these at the end or rather start and end over here.
We don't need to insert our id  here.
Our next one is firstname - so I'll say "Alex".
My lastname I'll say is "Garrett".
For my date of birth, I'll create a date function which equals to a variable "$date"
I'll put this in the particular structure.
We can see from our database over here that when we go to insert a value, we can scroll down and see that our calender function has dates on it.
So, on clicking 23rd, we can see the structure this field takes.
It's the year in long format.
Next is the month and then the day.
So 2009 02 23 which is 23rd of the 2nd, 2009.
So, what we can do here is, we can structure our date function in capital 'Y',  'm' and then 'd' using hyphen in between to get the structure we need.
So, this will be structured like that.
This will equal to this and that will be the current date.
Using the $date and presuming that is in the structure of our date, we can insert it into our table here.
The last one is gender and since I'm a male, I'm putting in "M" for male.
Presuming that will work, we can run this.
But before that, we could say or die at the end followed by  "mysql_error".
I will skip that for now but feel free to add them if you like.
Ok, so refreshing our page.
What you see is from the last tutorial.
ummmm..... Let's comment this out.
Let's ignore this.
This will completely ignore this part of tutorial.
Ok - so back to the code that I am currently showing and let's refresh.
I've refreshed it twice. So, accordingly 2 records have been put in.
But by going back to browse and scrolling down we can see, let's delete 1 of these, we can see the data 1 just specified, has been put into the database.
In fact, what I have done is I have put my date of birth as the current date which I didn't mean to do.
I don't want my date of birth as the current date because I was not born today.
My firstname is ok.  My lastname is ok.  My gender is fine.
We can see that my id is 6 at the moment and the next time we insert a record this would go up to 7 and then again to 8.
You should know that by now.Next what I'll show you is how to change my date of birth because I have made a mistake.
So, first I will comment these 2 lines so we don't have to re-run this.
And I'll create a new variable.  We will just comment this as "update data".
Current variable called "$update" and that's equal to "mysql_query()" function.
And inside the parameter that we are calling is mysql query code itself.
And here you  will type "UPDATE" and we are going to say the table name which is "people".
Then we will say "SET" and we need to pick a particular field in which to set.
This happens to be the "d o b" and that's equal to my actual date of birth which is 1989, the year I was born in and the month is November and the day I was born is 16th.
By running this command what we are actually doing is we are updating everyone's date of birth in this table to this.
That's because we've not specified where we want to update this.
But we can do is after this we can say "WHERE id=6" because my unique id is 6.
Let's have a look here.
Otherwise it will update everyone else's.
Remember I said the id is unique. It's better to say update my id.
What I could do instead is, say, "WHERE firstname equals 'Alex' ".  However this will update every record that has firstname "Alex".
But we can also say "AND lastname equals Garrett".
However, if we will have two people in the database with the same firstname and lastname, we are still running the same risk as before.
So, it's better to use our "unique" and that's the key word "unique id" which for me is 6.
So at the moment, you can see that my date of birth is set to 2009 which is the current date.
But, by refreshing this page nothing's happened because we are just running a command.
Now, if we click on Browse to refresh and we scroll down, we can see that it has changed to what we specified and everything else has been left intact.
So, if you need to update data in your database or anything like that, you can specify what data you want to update.
I used "dob" and that equals to the date of birth that was necessary.
I could have updated my lastname.
You also need to specify where you want this to be updated.
So, I said this record which is this long line here.
These are called records and I specified "WHERE" the id was equal to 6 and that has updated my unique record.
So that's what you have learnt - how to insert values and also how to update some values if you get it wrong like I did or if you just want to update some data which happens most of the time when your doing your databases.
Ok - so join me in the next part to find out how to start reading from your database and display the data to the user.
See you soon.  This is Juanita Jayakar, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.

This tutorial is contributed by Snehalatha Kaliappan and Meenal Ghoderao from IIT Bombay.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Scripts and Functions with Scilab.
Let us start with a brief introduction to the file formats in Scilab.
When several commands are to be executed, it may be more convenient to write these statements into a  file with the Scilab editor.
These are called as SCRIPT files.
To execute the commands written in such a script file, the exec function can be used followed by the name of the script file.
These files generally have the extension .sce or .sci, depending on its content.
Files having the .sci extension contain Scilab function and or user defined functions.
Executing these files loads the functions into Scilab environment (but does not execute them), whereas
files having the .sce extension contain Scilab function and User defined functions.
Please remember that the convention of naming the extension as .sce and .sci are not rules but a convention followed by the scilab community.
Let us open Scilab console window on the computer.
Check on the present working directory by typing the command pwd on the command prompt.
Go to the Task bar of scilab console window and click on Editor option to open the scilab editor.
I have already typed the commands in a file and saved it as helloworld.sce, therefore I will open that file using Open a file shortcut icon.
Select helloworld.sce file and click on Open.
You may type the commands in the new file and save this file to the current working directory as helloworld.sce through the File menu.
Go to Execute button on the scilab editors menu bar and select Load into Scilab option.
This will load the file into  scilab console.
After loading the file on the  console the script produces the output as you see.
It contains both the commands and the resulting output for the respective commands.
Now change the value of a to 1.
In the editor, go to the File menu and click on Save.
We can also execute the script directly from the scilab interpreter using the exec command and giving the path to the script file as:
exec into brackets into double quotes helloworld.sce, that is the file name, and press Enter.
The script file produces a similar output with the use of exec function.
Let us now talk about functions.
A function definition starts with the keyword function and ends with the keyword endfunction.
I have already saved a function file in function.sci, using the scilab editor.
I will open that file.
As you see, the function is defined here.
In these, degrees is the output parameter and radians is the input parameter.
To the function name radians2degrees.
I will  load this function in Scilab, using the Execute menu option.
The function is now loaded in the scilab console.
It can also be loaded  using the exec command.
Once a function is loaded, it can be called like any other Scilab function by passing specific arguments to that function.
Make a mental note of the percent sign (%) and recall the reason of its use.
Now let us find values for radians2degrees of %pi/2 and radians2degrees of (%pi/4).
percent pi/2  and radians2degrees  percent pi by 4 (%pi/4).
Now we will see a function with more than one input and output arguments.
This function will take polar coordinates as input argument and returns rectangular coordinates as output arguments.
I will open the file which I have already typed.
Here you can see, x and y are the output parameters and r and theta are the input parameters to the function polar2rect.
I will  load this function in scilab using the exec option.
Once the function is loaded, we need to call the function. This function requires two input arguments and two output arguments.
Therefore r = 2,
theta = 45;
and now we will call it x1 comma y1, output parameters, is equal to function name polar2rect into bracket  r comma theta and press Enter.
You will see the value of x1 and y1.
One of the interesting features of Scilab is, you can define any number of functions in a single .sci file.
While doing this, please remember that by default all the variables defined in a function are local, the scope of these variables used in a particular function ends with the endfunction keyword of the function definition.
Advantage of this feature is that, we can use same variable names in different function.
These variables won't get mixed up unless we use the global option.
To know more about the global variables, type help global.
Please note that if any variable is to be "watched" or monitored inside a function then disp is required.
Inside a function file, you can check for yourself the effect of putting a semicolon ( ; ) at the end of a statement.
Also check this for disp statements.
Inline Functions: Functions are segments of code that have well defined input and output as well as local variables.
The simplest way to define a function  is by using the command `deff.
Scilab allows the creation of in-line functions and are especially useful when the body of the function is short.
This can be done with the help of the function deff().
It takes two string parameters.
The first string defines the interface to the function and the second string defines the statements of the function.
The deff command defines the function in the Scilab and also loads it.
There is no need to load the function defined by using deff command explicitly through execute menu option .
Let us see an example to illustrate this concept:
I will open a file inline.sci where I have written the inline function.
I will resize the editor window.
As mentioned earlier, the first string defines the function declaration and the second string defines the statements of the function.
We will load this function in Scilab editor and use it to find the values of degrees2radians of 90 and degrees2radians of 45.
A function should call, not just other functions within itself, but also itself.
This is recursive calling of a function.
This is required, for example, when writing a function to calculate the factorial of an integer.
Let us extend the discussion on file formats in Scilab:
As mentioned earlier Scilab uses two types of file formats, namely the .sce file format and the .sci file formats.
The files with the .sce file extension are the script files which contain the Scilab commands that you enter during an interactive kind of Scilab session.
They can comprise comment lines utilized in documenting the function and they can also use the command exec to execute the script.
The files with the .sci file extension are the function files that start with the function statement.
A single .sci file can have multiple function definitions which themselves contain any number of Scilab statements, that perform operations on the function arguments or on the output variables, after they have been evaluated.
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on Scripts and Functions in Scilab.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Editing Existing Content.
In this tutorial, we will learn about  Inline editing
using CKEditor and
configuring CKEditor.
First, we will learn about Inline Editing.
Hover the cursor over the Title. On the right hand side, we will see a pencil icon.
When we hover over the Title, it will ask us to configure the block.
Click on the  Configure block. The block is the general block for Page Title.
Changing this will change the way Page Titles appear on every node.
Click on Go back to site. Hover over the pencil here and click on Configure block.
If you want to change the tabs, you can change them here.
I will leave it as it is.
Click Back to site.
Now, click on the pencil in the Content area.
You will see three options– Quick edit, Edit and Delete.
Quick edit is front end editing in an inline window.
Edit takes us back to the main editing window for a node.
Delete will delete the node after confirmation.
Let’s click on Quick edit to edit our node in an inline fashion.
As we hover, it takes us to different sections of the individual node.
When we click on it, we are able to add more content, view the source and even bold some text.
Once we make a change, Drupal asks us to save. Click Save to update the node.
Now, let’s learn to change an article node, say Welcome to Drupalville.
Click on Quick edit. Notice that the Title and the body fields are editable here in the front end.
But we can't edit the image.
In order to edit the image, we need to go into the edit screen.
Now we can make changes to the body and save it.
I can also edit the tags in the Quick edit window.
The front end editing in Drupal is suitable for simple edits.
Edit tab is a fantastic feature of Drupal to update the content anytime.
Wysiwyg Editor was mentioned several times before.
It stands for what you see is what you get.
Wysiwyg Editor is quite helpful.
Let’s change Text Format to Full HTML first.
This will give us an idea of the formatting options available in the Wysiwyg Editor.
In Drupal, the CKEditor comes with Drupal core.
It is turned ON by default and is configurable.
Let’s take a quick look. Highlight the text "Welcome to our site".
Change the format from Normal to Heading 2.
Immediately, Drupal gives us a preview of what the text will look like.
This is determined by the theme and the cascading style sheets or CSS that the theme gives us.
Let us add some more text here, “Editing Drupal nodes is really fun!”.
Now highlight that text, turn off the Italics and create a hyperlink for that text.
Here, let’s say,
Hover the mouse and notice that the text is now hyperlinked.
To remove the hyperlink, highlight the text and click on Unlink.
To undo a change, press Ctrl+Z.
We can also add ordered and unordered lists by clicking on the Bullets and numbering icons here.
Click on Unordered list. Then add bullets - one, two, three.
Next, click on Ordered list and add one, two and three.
To use Block quotes, highlight some text and click the Block Quote link.
Once again, the formatting is managed by our theme.
We can easily insert images also. I have chosen this file which I had uploaded on the first node.
In the Alternate Text field, I’ll type “Drupal Logo”.
Under Align, I will choose Right. Add a Caption if you want.
Lastly, click on Save.
It is now added to the node inside the body. Hover over the image, click and drag it to a new position, if you want.
We will first have to re-size our editing window a little so that we can drag our image anywhere we want.
Hovering over the image also allows us to resize our images.
Before adding images to your Drupal node, make sure that your images are properly sized and formatted.
That will help a lot in aligning the content on the node.
We can add a table or a horizontal line.
And, even show the blocks that we created in our node.
So, here is the H2 block, a block code, paragraph, tag etc.
If you know HTML, then you can view the source by clicking on this icon.
Explore each of these options thoroughly before proceeding ahead.
Recall that we have turned on Full HTML.
If we change this to Basic HTML, it is going to warn us.
There is a possibility of the content being permanently lost or deleted.
Say, we have inserted a JavaScript, I-frame, youtube video, a google map or something like that.
Changing to Basic HTML, will cause Drupal to remove those contents.
In order to avoid these kinds of problems, keep only what you actually need.
Let’s cancel the changes in the settings, so we won’t lose anything.
This is a quick overview of CKEditor that comes with Drupal.
And we have learnt how to customize it.
Now click Save and keep published.
The modified node is displayed.
Next, let's learn to configure the CKEditor.
Let’s click on Configuration at the top.
Now click on Text formats and editors.
We will notice that Basic HTML and Full HTML use the CKEditor.
And, they are assigned to Authenticated User and Administrator.
These are two unique user roles.
In Drupal, our user has different roles and each role has to be given permissions.
In this case, Basic HTML can be used by an Authenticated user and Administrator.
The CKEditor has been assigned for these 2 roles.
Similarly, Full HTML can be used by an Administrator.
Now, let’s check CKEditor for the Basic HTML.
Click on Configure and you will be able to assign it to different roles.
Assign any Text editor that you want. And then give them permissions for the buttons that they are allowed to use.
Recall - this is the Active toolbar we had, for the Authenticated User for Basic HTML Text Format.
What if we want to add one of these buttons to our Active toolbar? This is very simple.
Let’s choose Paste from Word icon from Available buttons.
Then click and drag the mouse until a little blue box opens up where we can add the icon.
To add a new group, click on Add group button. Name it “copy and paste” and then click on Apply.
Now, click and drag Paste from Word icon into the copy and paste section.
Let’s now add all the paste icons here.
So, we have added three new buttons to our bar for Basic HTML format.
Paste icons are something that every toolbar needs, as most text are copy-pasted from files.
We also upload inline-images and upload images with a maximum file size of 32MB, with any width and height.
The maximum size may be different in your installation.
We can change any of these settings down here, as per our preference.
Say, we always want to change a URL into a link, instead of manually linking it.
We can do so by clicking Convert URLs into links option.
Here we also have the Filter settings. Let’s click on Limit allowed HTML tags.
Now, we will be able to add the HTML tags that we can use, when we look at the source.
So, this is a really powerful WYSIWYG editor and its configuration area.
Once we have made all our changes, click the Save configuration button.
Let us now look at our Content.
Click the Edit option in "Welcome to Drupalville" node.
Notice that since we had Full HTML turned ON, nothing has changed.
Let’s now change this to Basic HTML. All the changes are still there.
Though I can’t see my blocks anymore, the Paste icons are now available.
I don’t want this image here. So, I’ll delete it by clicking on the image and pressing the Backspace or Delete key on my keyboard.
Click on Save and keep published.
Once again, click on Configuration. Scroll down and click on Text formats and editor.
This time let us configure the Full HTML toolbar.
Notice that we have got a few more buttons here but not the Paste icons.
Click Show group names and click Add group on the second line this time.
Name it as “copy and paste”. Now we can click and drag these into our copy and paste section.
Similarly down here, we have all these options again. For now, click on Save configuration button.
Let’s go back to our Welcome to Drupalville again and change it to Full HTML.
Click Continue. And now, we see two rows of buttons.
This means, our editor is all set.
Take some time to play around with the CKEditor, and make sure that you understand it well.
With this we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Importing Mesh files in OpenFOAM.
In this tutorial, you will learn to:
As a prerequisite, the user should know how to generate a Mesh in softwares like -
Using blockMesh, we can easily make simple geometries. For example- box, pipe etc.
But OpenFOAM supports importing mesh from third party meshing software.
We will now learn to import these files.
Here is the geometry of our case.
We are solving this for a Reynolds Number (Re) = 100.
This is the mesh file generated in a meshing software.
In your OpenFOAM working directory, go to the icoFoam solver and click on it.
Now, create a folder by the name cylinder.
Now go to the cavity case. Copy the '0' (zero0 and system folders from the cavity case.
Paste this inside the cylinder folder. Note that you do not need the constant folder.
On my desktop, I have a Fluent mesh file with a .(dot) msh extension. It is named as cylmesh.msh.
Copy-and-paste this file in the cylinder folder, in icoFoam. Our setup is now ready.
Open the command terminal. Type "run" and press Enter.
Type: cd space tutorials; press Enter.
Type: cd space incompressible and press Enter. Type cd space  icoFoam; press Enter. Type cd space cylinder and press Enter.
For a Fluent mesh file, in the command terminal, we need to type "fluentMeshToFoam" (Note that M, T, F are capital here) (space) "cylmesh.msh" and press Enter.
On the terminal, you will see that the mesh file is now converted to openFoam data file.
Now, go back to the cylinder folder.
The constant folder has been generated. Click on the constant folder to open it.
transport Property file is missing from the constant folder.
Go two levels back and copy the transport property from the constant folder of the cavity case.
Paste this inside the constant folder of cylinder which we created just now. We will keep the default viscosity.
Note that we do not run blockMesh command here. To view the boundary conditions in the mesh file,
go to Constant > polyMesh. Type "ls". You will see the boundary file.
Open it in any editor of your choice.
The boundary condition names are as seen in the geometry slide.
In case of any error with the boundary names, you can refer the boundary file. Close this.
In the terminal, go two levels back and go to the '0' (zero) folder.
Open the pressure file in the '0' (zero) folder.
Note that the boundary names should exactly match with the boundary file. Change them if needed. Close this file.
Go one level back and go to the system folder.
Open the controlDict file.
We will change the end time of the controlDict file. Close this.
Go one level back. To start the iterations, type "icoFoam" and press Enter. Iterations running will be seen in the terminal.
To view the geometry, type paraFoam and press Enter. In the ParaView window, click on the Apply button in the object inspector menu.
You can see the geometry. In the Active variable control menu, change from solid color to 'U' velocity.
The initial velocity condition is seen here.
Click on the play button in the VCR menu, on the top right-hand side.
We can see the velocity contours with the passage of time.
Close the  paraview window.
Here is a list of commands to import geometry from other meshing software.
In this tutorial, we learnt importing geometry from other meshing softwares.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Determination of Solubility Product using Vlabs.
In this tutorial we will learn to, Determine Solubility of salts and
Here, I am using
ChemCollective Vlabs version 2.1.0 and
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with,
If not for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
Here, I have opened Virtual Chemistry labs application window.
Click on File menu and select Load Homework option.
Double-click on Solubility and Solids option.
A workbench opens with required chemicals and Problem Description.
Under the Stockroom Explorer  double click on Problem Description.
Problem Description window opens.
The problem states that, using Virtual labs, We have to determine Solubility Products of
We have to also find the solubility of the above salts in Moles/Litre.
Finally we have to compare the Solubility and Solubility Products for pairs of salts.
Close the Problem Description window.
A substance's solubility product, is the mathematical product of its dissolved ion concentrations raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.
For Example: Solubility of Silver Chloride in its saturated solution is given as follows:
For every one mole of silver chloride that dissolves, one mole of silver ion and one mole of chloride ion is produced.
Let us assign a variable S to represent solubility of Silver and Chloride ions.
Solubility Product of silver chloride is S squared.
Here is the solubility of Silver carbonate in its saturated solution.
Stoichiometric concentrations of the ions are in the ratio of 2 : 1
In this equation, solubility of silver ion is two S and carbonate ion is S.
Solubility Product of silver carbonate is four S cube.
Significance of Solubility Product.
Water is generally used as a solvent.
Solubility Product is a heterogeneous equilibrium constant.
The smaller the Solubility Product of a substance, the lower is its solubility.
Solubility Product values are useful in predicting, the precipitation in reactions.
When the Ionic product is greater than Solubility Product,  then precipitation will occur.
When the Ionic product is smaller than Solubility Product, then precipitation will not occur.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Block component modeling.
how to connect blocks,
how to use blocks from Modelica Library.
To record this tutorial, I am using: OpenModelica version 1.9.2
You may use any of the following operating systems.
To understand and practice this tutorial, you need knowledge of component oriented modeling in Modelica.
Prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website. Please go through them.
Let us now learn more about blocks.
block is a specialized class in Modelica.
It is useful in control applications.
For example, Modelica Library has blocks for PI and PID controllers which are frequently seen in chemical engineering control applications.
Variables of a block class must have fixed causality, either input or output.
blocks can be connected using connect statements.
We have learnt about connect statements in previous tutorials.
Connectors acts as interface between blocks.
They are used to model input and output signals.
For example, this is declaration for a block connector that models real input signals.
Let us now try to understand block component modeling through an example.
Let us write a class that uses blocks to perform the following operations:
Take a time varying signal as input and amplify it by a constant.
Let us define this problem statement in detail using schematics.
This figure shows a schematic for block that takes two signals as input and returns their sum.
To make things simpler, let us choose signal 1 to be t which represents time.
Let signal 2 be 2 times t squared.
This is schematic for amplification of a signal.
It is similar to the previous case with two inputs and one output.
Let us choose one input to be our signal.
Let the other input i.e. signal 2 be a constant K by which to amplify the signal.
The product of these two inputs is the output required.
We have chosen the signal 2 i.e. K to be 5 units.
Notice that both the sum of signals and amplification require a block with 2 inputs and 1 output.
Modelica library already has a block named MISO that stands for Multiple Input Single Output.
It is available in Modelica.Interfaces.Block package.
The input to this block u is a vector since it can accept multiple signals as input.
y is the output which is a scalar.
Let us now discuss how to solve our problem using OMEdit.
Extend MISO block to create a block named Sum.
We have learnt about extending a class in previous tutorials.
Extend MISO to create a block named Product.
Create a class named main.
Create instances of Sum and Product blocks in the main class.
Lastly, program the necessary equations related to input and output variables.
Note that Sum corresponds to the Sum of signals whereas Product corresponds to the amplification of signal.
I have already created the necessary blocks and packaged them into a file named arithmeticOperationsUsingBlocks.
You may locate this file on our website and download it.
Let me now switch to OMEdit.
I shall first demonstrate the package arithmeticOperationsUsingBlocks and then demonstrate the syntax of MISO block.
I have already opened the package arithmeticOperationsUsingBlocks in OMEdit.
Let me expand it in the Libraries Browser.
Note that the package has blocks named Sum, Product and a main class.
Double-click on all three of them.
Let me also open MISO block from Modelica Library.
Expand Modelica library.
Go to Blocks → Interfaces.  Scroll down a bit.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on conversion of Excel data to Marc 21 format.
In this tutorial, we will learn to convert Excel data to Marc 21 format on a 64-bit Windows machine.
To record this tutorial, I am using: Windows 10 Pro and
Before moving ahead, please ensure that you have the following on your machine-
Any web browser. For eg: Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome.
Earlier in the same series, we had installed MarcEdit 7 on the Desktop.
Open the same MarcEdit 7 by double-clicking on the icon.
A window named MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese opens.
Locate and click on the tab Export Tab Delimited Text.
Under the Source File field, locate the icon for a folder.
The source file is an Excel file which we are converting into .mrk format.
Click on this icon for the Folder and browse for the Excel file in the field for File name.
Click on the drop-down adjacent to File name.
If you have Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 (.xls) then choose the format Excel File(*.xls).
And if you have, Microsoft Excel 2007/2010/2013 XML(.xlsx) then choose the format Excel File(*.xlsx).
As I have the .(dot)xlsx  file, I will select Excel XML File(*.xlsx).
Next, go to the left-side folders and select the folder where your Excel file is saved.
I have selected Downloads because that’s where I saved my Excel file.
So, from the Downloads folder, I have selected TestData.xlsx.
When the file TestData.xlsx is selected, it appears in the File name field.
Now, click on the Open button at the bottom of the window.
The same window re-opens with the Source File as  C:\Users\spoken\Downloads\TestData.xlsx.
Now, click on the folder icon adjacent to the Output File.
On doing so, Save File window opens prompting us to fill in the File name.
On the same window, I will click on the Downloads folder located at the left hand side.
Now click on Save button at the bottom of the page.
The same window appears again.
Note that Excel Sheet Name: Sheet1 gets selected automatically by MarcEdit 7.
Under the Section Options, the check-box UTF-8 Encoded is selected by MarcEdit 7, by default.
Click on the Next button at the right side of the same window.
Again a new window, MarcEdit Delimited Text Translator opens.
This window will have all the field details as per entries made in the Excel file.
We will see the Fields ranging from 0 to 8 and above with their corresponding values.
For example, Field 0 has a value of 978-3-319-47238-6 (ISBN) on my machine.
You may see a different value as per your Excel sheet.
Under the section DataSnapshot, locate the section Settings.
Go to the tab Select and from the drop-down select Field 0.
With this we will be doing the mapping of Excel data with Koha MARC Tags.
Remember, you can customize Map To: and Indicators.
However, it is important that the Fields and Subfield Codes are as per the Koha MARC Tag.
For more information on MARC Tags, visit the link of official Library of Congress site.
On the browser, type this URL and click on search.
Recall that Map To: values entered in the field are referred from an earlier tutorial in this series.
I will enter 020$a in the Map To: field.
This sequence will change as per your Excel data.
I will leave Indicators: and Term. Punctuation: as they are.
However, you may fill these fields as directed by the Koha MARC Tags.
Next is the check-box for Constant Data.
Click this if you wish to map the same information  into the data field for each entry, in the delimited text document.
Click Repeatable subfield if you want to repeat the same subfield.
Next, click on the button Add Argument.
On doing so, the value 0 020$a 0 appears in the field under the section Arguments.
Similarly, let’s map all the other fields.
Under the section Settings, go to Select. From the drop- down, select Field 1.
In the field for Map To, type:  080$a.
Now, click on the button Add Argument.
On doing so, the value 1 080$a 0 appears in the field under the section Arguments.
Under the tab Select, from the drop-down, select Field 2.
In the field for Map To, type: 100$a.
In the field for Indicators, type 1.
Note that 1 is the first indicator of tag 100 and it represents the Surname for the subfield ‘a’.
Likewise, complete the mapping of all the fields up to Field 13 as being shown in the drop-down under Select.
Notice the up and down arrows adjacent to each field.
You may use these to change the sequence of the values that appear.
Under the section Arguments, the Tags that are common with different sub-fields need to be joined.
For that, do the following- Select common tags for example 245$a and 245$c.
Then right-click on common tags and from drop-down select Join Items.
This will create a grouping of the fields that are with the same type.
Note that the * (asterisk symbol) will appear before the selected Tags.
The * asterisk symbol indicates that the common tags are now joined.
Alternately, you can do the mapping of fields by clicking on the tab Auto Generate to import the values of respective fields from 0 to 13, in the fields provided for Arguments.
However, I have done mapping manually. So, I will not click Auto Generate option.
Next we see four options.
First one is Save Template.
Use this if you want to save the same mapping for future use.
The saved template will be used if in case you face any problem with data conversion.
If we choose the option Save Template, then we will be prompted to give it a name and  specify the directory for saving it.
It will get saved as .mrd file
Access this template in the future by clicking “Load Template” at the right side of the window.
Second option is Sort Fields.
Third option is Calculate common nonfiling data.
Fourth option is Ignore Header Row.
Click here, if you have a header in the Excel sheet and if you need to ignore the headings.
Among these, Sort Fields and Calculate common nonfiling data are auto-selected by MarcEdit 7.
I will leave them as they are.
Now, I will check the check-box for Save Template and Ignore Header Row.
Next, locate and click on the tab Finish on the top right corner of the page.
On doing so, Save File window opens, prompting us to fill in the File name.
On the same window, I will click on the Downloads folder, located at the left hand side.
And, in the field for File name, I will type TestData.
Now, click on Save button at the bottom of the page.
A pop-up window with the message: Process has been finished. Records saved to:
Click on the Ok button at the bottom of this dialog-box.
With this, .mrk file has been successfully saved in the directed location which is the Downloads folder.
A new page MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese, opens.
A new page MarcEditor opens.
A window Open File opens showing TestData.mrk file.
Click and select the TestData.mrk file.
It will show in the field for File name.
Now click on Open at the bottom of the window.
Another window MarcEditor: TestData.mrk opens with all the details.
On the same window, from the main menu, click on the File.
Now, from the drop-down select Compile File into MARC.
Another new window Save File opens.
Here, locate File Name: and type the appropriate name in the field.
I will type TestData.
Koha, by default, selects MARC Files (*.mrc) in the field Save as type:.
Now, click on the Save button located at the bottom of the window.
Upon doing so, on the same window at the bottom, you will see 5 records processed in 0.166228 seconds.
This is because I imported only 5 records. You will see a different number of records and processed time as per your data.
With this, we have converted Excel data of our library into Marc 21 format successfully.
Marc 21 format is the standard format used in Koha for cataloging and importing data into Koha.
Now, close this window. To do so, go to the top right corner and click on the Close button.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to- convert Excel data to Marc 21 format on a 64-bit Windows machine.

Welcome to this tutorial on Energy Skate Park simulation.
In this tutorial, We will demonstrate Energy Skate Park, PhET simulation.
Java version 1.7.0
Firefox Web Browser version 53.02.2
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with topics in high school physics.
2. To show pie chart and bar graphs for energy changes.
3. To use Energy vs Position graph, to show the energy value at a particular position.
4. To change location and observe the energy changes.
5. About change in energy due to change in mass and friction.
According to law of conservation of energy, energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
It can only be converted from one form to another.
The total energy before and after the transformation is conserved.
Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object by virtue of its position.
PE = mgh  where m is mass of the object , g is acceleration due to gravity and h is height.
Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion.
KE =1/2 mv
Let us start the demonstration.
I have already downloaded Energy skate park simulation to my Downloads folder.
Then type: java space hyphen jar space energy hyphen skate hyphen park underscore en dot jar and press Enter.
Energy Skate Park simulation opens.
This is the interface of Energy skate Park simulation.
Using this simulation, let's see how energy transformations happen in real world applications.
Screen has a menu bar with menu items- File,
Tracks,
Help.
Screen has a PhET skater oscillating in a default loop.
To change the track of the skater, click on Tracks menu.
Menu shows a list of tracks to choose.
On the right side, there is a panel with controls.
These controls are used to change the attributes in the simulation.
Click on Reset to reset the simulation.  Click on Yes to confirm the reset.
Click on Choose Skater button on the panel.
Choose Skater panel opens.
This panel shows different skaters along with their mass.
By default, PhET Skater with 75 kg mass is selected.
At the bottom of the screen, we have Sim Speed slider to control the speed of the animation,
Play/Pause and Step buttons,
Zoom in and zoom out buttons.
By default, Sim Speed slider is on fast.
Drag the Sim speed slider between slow and fast.
To show the path, click on Show Path button in Path section.
Observe the purple dots on the track.
Click on Stop button and then pause the simulation.
Click on any purple dot on the track.
The following information will be displayed:
Kinetic energy,
Potential energy,
Total energy,
Height,
Speed of skater.
Click on Clear button to clear the path.
Now, click on Play button to play the simulation.
On the right side panel, under Energy Graphs section, click Show Pie Chart check-box.
Observe that with Thermal check-box also gets selected.
Pie chart shows conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy and vice-versa.
Energy indicator box is shown on the top right corner of the screen.
This box helps to identify the energy changes in the Pie Chart.
In this case, potential energy is gravitational potential energy.
It is due to change in height of the skater in the gravitational field.
As the skater moves downwards, his potential energy decreases and kinetic energy increases.
As skater moves upwards his potential energy increases and kinetic energy decreases.
Drag the sim speed slider towards Slow.
You can still see a small amount of potential energy at the bottom of the track.
This is because track is at a height above the ground level.
Drag the track to the ground level.
Observe that skater has zero potential energy at the bottom of the track and zero kinetic energy at the top.
Now I will drag the track above the ground level.
Click on Potential Energy Reference check-box.
P.E=0 at this dotted line will display at the bottom of the screen.
Drag Potential Energy Reference line upwards to touch the bottom of the track.
Observe that now skater has zero potential energy at the bottom of the track.
Next, click on Bar Graph button.
A bar graph with four energies is shown.
Note the energy changes as the skater moves back and forth on the track.
Here total energy of the skater remains constant.
Therefore it obeys the law of conservation of energy.
Let us change the shape and height of the track.
Click on any blue point and drag.
Note the increase in Total energy with an increase in height of the track.
Close the Bar Graph.
Next click on Energy vs. Position button.
Energy vs Position  graph will display.
Drag the track to the left side to view the graph and skater simultaneously.
Notice the energy changes with respect to position of skater.
Here you can see a moving dotted line.
It represents energy of the skater at a particular position on the track.
Graph has four energy check-boxes at the bottom.
To view the graph of any specific energy, un-check remaining check boxes.
Click on Pause button to pause the simulation.
Click on Copy button.
Copy button helps to show the energy values at particular position on the graph.
Close the graphs.
Now click on Energy vs. Time button.
Energy vs. Time graph opens.
At the bottom of the graph, we have- Sim Speed slider,
Stop/Go,  Playback,
Step, Rewind and Clear buttons.
Click on Stop button.
Lets drag the sim speed slider between slow and fast.
Then click on Playback button.
Notice a violet vertical line moving across the path.
Note the kinetic, Potential and Total energy values at a given time.
Note that Total energy remains constant.
But, kinetic energy changes to potential energy and vice-versa.
Here Thermal energy is zero as there is no friction.
Close the Energy vs. Time graph.
Let us see how mass of the skater will affect the total energy.
Scroll to the bottom of the panel.
Click on Edit skater button.
Scroll down to see Mass text-box and Mass Slider.
By default, Mass is 75 kg.
Click on Energy Vs. Time button to open the graph.
Drag the Mass slider gradually towards 200.
Observe the change in energy as we change the skater's mass in the graph.
Close the Energy Vs. Time graph.
Now we will take the skater to different planets.
Scroll up the panel.
In the Location section, by default, Earth is selected.
Click on Energy vs. Time button.
Under Location section, click on Moon radio-button.
Observe that Skater flies off because moon has low Gravity value.
Click on Return Skater button.
Here Gravity value is 1.62 N/kg which is less than that of Earth.
This results in decrease in the speed of skater.
Here, Total energy decreases as gravity on Moon is less than that of Earth.
Similarly, explore Jupiter and Space locations and compare the energy changes.
Close the Energy vs. Time graph.
Let us study the energy distribution for tracks with and without friction.
Scroll down to panel and click on Track Friction button.
Scroll down to see Coefficient of Friction slider.
Click on Energy vs.Time button.
Drag the Coefficient of Friction slider gradually from None to Lots.
Observe the energy changes.
Here, part of energy is converted to Thermal energy due to friction.
This is due to the resistance in motion caused by friction.
Friction opposes the motion of the skater.
It causes him to lose energy and slow down.
Close the Energy vs. Time graph.
Compare the energy changes in Double well track with Double Well Roller Coaster Mode.
Find the changes in the thermal energy
and give an explanation. (Hint-Right click on the Track and select Roller Coaster Mode).
Using Tracks box, create tracks and observe the change in energies.
Let us summarise.
In this tutorial, we have demonstrated, How to use Energy Skate Park, PhET simulation.
Using this simulation we have learnt,
2. To show pie chart and bar graphs for energy changes.
3. To use Energy vs Position graph to show the energy value at a particular position.
4. To change location and observe the energy changes.
5. About change in energy due to change in mass and friction.

This is Meenal Ghoderao from IIT-Bombay.
Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on installing and running PyFoam
In this tutorial, we will learn how to Install and check PyFoam and the required steps for the same.
What is PyFoam
Checking installation of OpenFOAM
Installing Python, Numpy and Gnuplot
Install PyFoam using pip
Install PyFoam using sources
And  Check if PyFoam is working
To record this tutorial I am using
Note that PyFoam will also work with OpenFoam v1.6 and above
To practice this tutorial, the user should have  Basic knowledge of Linux terminal commands
Experience with running and analyzing OpenFOAM cases
If not, please go through the Linux tutorial series on this website
What is PyFoam?
PyFoam is a collection of Python libraries and utilities
It can be used to manipulate OpenFOAM simulations
It is Designed to make working with OpenFOAM easier
PyFoam can be also be used for  iteratively running simulations
automate data collection
parametrically modify case files and many other such useful activities.
Note that PyFoam works over OpenFOAM
So, we need to always have an installation of OpenFOAM in our computer.
First we check if our installation of OpenFOAM has been done properly.
Open the terminal, and type icoFoam space hyphen help
You should get the details of icoFoam and OpenFOAM version and help text
Now we will install the necessary prerequisites for PyFoam, such as Python, Pip, Numpy and Gnuplot  using the terminal.
First we will type - sudo apt-get install python hyphen dev and press Enter.
After this, type sudo apt-get install python-pip and press Enter.
Then, type pip install Numpy
Then, type sudo apt-get install gnuplot space gnuplot hyphen x11 and press Enter.
With this we are done with installing the pre-requisites.
Now we will install  PyFoam using pip.
Open the terminal and type: pip install PyFoam
We can also install PyFoam from source
To do so, open the browser and in the URL window, type
Download PyFoam-0.6.5.tar.gz
In the terminal, go to Downloads folder.   Type tar -xvf space PyFoam hyphen 0.6.5.tar.gz
Then Type cd followed by the name of the folder PyFoam hyphen 0.6.5
After this, type sudo python setup dot py' space install
Now we have to check if PyFoam is detecting  OpenFoam and working properly.
Switch to terminal again.
Type python .  Type import PyFoam
Then type print PyFoam dot FoamInformation dot foamTutorials followed by open-close brackets.
This should print the directory of the OpenFOAM Tutorials.
Now let us summarise. In this tutorial, we learnt about PyFoam.
We also learnt to check the installation of OpenFoam

In this tutorial, we will learn
file handling with the following functions:
write() function ,read() function
mopen() , mclose().
For demonstration, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 operating system with Scilab version 5.3.3 installed.
You should have basic knowledge of Scilab.
Now we will see some functions in Scilab which are useful for file handling.
File handling involves-
writing to a file using write() function,
reading from a file using read() function,
opening an existing file using mopen() function and
closing an already opened file using mclose() function.
Let us start with writing data to a file.
For this purpose the write() command is used.
Switch to the Scilab console window.
To begin with let us create a matrix of random numbers.
Type:  random underscore matrix is equal to rand into bracket 20 comma 1 close the bracket semicolon and press Enter.
Now check the present working directory.
Type  pwd .
In my case, the present working directory is slash home slash fossee .
Make sure that you are in a directory where you have read & write permission, before you execute these commands.
Now we will write the content of variable random underscore matrix into a text file using the write command.
Type:--> write into bracket into quotes random dash numbers dot txt close the quotes comma random underscore matrix close the bracket and press Enter.
Let us see whether this file has been created.
I will minimize the Scilab console window.
And open the file which will be created and saved in the fossee directory of my computer.
You can see the data from variable random underscore matrix is written in a text file random dash numbers dot txt.
Coming back to the Scilab console.
Now we will see how to read the data from a file.
For this we will use the command read as follows:
Type: new underscore vector is equal to read into bracket into quote random dash numbers dot txt close the quotes comma 20 comma 1 close the bracket and press Enter.
The read command reads all the data from the file mentioned in the argument,
in this case random dash numbers dot txt,
and stores in the variable new underscore vector.
If we modify the above command as:
new underscore vector is equal to read into bracket into quotes random dash numbers dot txt comma 19 comma 1
The read command reads only 19 data values from the file mentioned in this argument,
in this case random dash numbers dot txt,
and stores in the variable new underscore vector.
Issue this command on the Scilab console and verify the output.
Now let us see about the mopen() function:
fd = mopen into bracket file-name comma mode
mopen command is used to open an existing file in a way compatible to C fopen procedure.
mode is a character string that controls whether the file is opened for:
r = opens the file for reading.
rb = opens a binary file for reading.
rt = opens a text file for reading.
w = creates a new file for writing or opens and truncates a file to zero length.
wb = creates a new binary file for writing or opens and truncates a file to zero length.
wt = creates a text binary file for writing or opens and truncates a file to zero length.
a or ab = appends (opens a file for writing at the end of the file or creates a file for writing).
r+ or r+b = opens a file for update (reading and writing).
For eg. fd underscore r is equal to mopen('random-numbers,'rt')
The above command opens the 'random-numbers' as a 'text and read-only' mode.
mclose  into bracket fd:
closes the opened file by using mopen
where fd is the file descriptor of the opened file.
If fd is omitted, mclose() closes the last opened file.
That's all we have in this tutorial.
We have learnt -  File handling with the following functions:
write() function , read() function
mopen() , mclose().

Thank you for joining.
Welcome to this Spoken tutorial of Mozilla Firefox.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop-ups.
In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04.
Mozilla Firefox allows you to load multiple web pages into separate tabs within the same browser window.
The biggest advantage of tabbed browsing is that it eliminates the need to display multiple browser windows.
And hence it helps to keep your desktop clutter-free.
Each tab occupies the browser's entire viewing area when displayed.
It eliminates the need to frequently resize and reposition the opened browser windows.
Tabbed browsing also consumes less memory and operating system resources than tiled-window browsing
provided the user does not open too many tabs at once.
Let's say, you are on a particular webpage.
Here is a link - “Firefox for Desktop”.
You can open this link in a new tab.
To do so, right-click on the link.
In the context menu, click on Open link in new tab.
You notice that a new tab opens to the right of the existing tab, in the same browser window.
So, without closing or moving out of your window, you can open another webpage in the same window.
You can also open a new tab by clicking on File and New Tab.
The shortcut keys for this are Ctrl+T.
Notice that when you open a new tab, the new tab immediately becomes active.
Now go to the URL bar and type: ‘www.google.com’.
You will now have 3 tabs, each with a different web page!
You can also open a new tab by clicking the ‘+’  button to the right of the rightmost tab.
We can also arrange  the tabs as per our requirements.
Just click on a tab and without releasing the mouse button, move it to the required location.
Now release the 'mouse button'.
The tab is now in the desired location.
Let us look at some basic operations which Mozilla Firefox allows us to perform.
Let us change the search engine to “google”.
In the Search bar type: ‘email wikipedia’ and click on the magnifying glass to the right of the 'Search bar'.
The relevant Wikipedia page is the first search result.
Let's open this page by clicking on the link.
Now, click on File and then on “Save Page As”.
Let's save the file on the Desktop with the name ‘Search.html’.
Now, let us open a new tab in the browser window by clicking on File and New Tab.
Now, let's open our saved page in this new Tab window.
Click on File and Open File .
Browse and open the saved file.
In the URL bar, you see that the address is not an internet address but a local location on your computer.
Now you can read this page, even when you are offline.
Pop-ups are windows that appear automatically without your permission.
Firefox allows us to control both pop-ups and pop-unders through the Content tab within Preferences window.
On 'Windows', this would be within the Options window.
Pop-up blocking is turned on, by default.
Click on Edit and Preferences.
Windows users please click on Tools and Options.
In the Content tab, the first option Block pop-up windows is checked, by default.
If not, then please check this option.
The various options of this dialog box will be discussed in another tutorial.
Here is a quick summary of what we learnt:
Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop ups.
Try this comprehension test assignment.
Open a new tab.Change the search engine to ‘google’.
Search for 'The history of email'.
Save the first result and open it in a new tab to view as an offline document.
Change the search engine to ‘bing’.
Again, search for 'The history of email'.
Save the link ‘History of Email & Ray Tomlinson’ and open it in a new tab to view as an offline document.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Metal Displacement Reactions using Vlabs.
In this tutorial we will learn to, Carry out displacement reactions of,
Arrange metals in decreasing order of reactivity.
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with, ChemCollective Vlabs interface.
If not for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
Here I am using
Here I have opened Virtual Chemistry Labs application window.
Click on File menu and select Load Homework option.
Default Lab Setup dialog box opens.
Double-Click on Redox Folder.
Click on Problem Description in the Stockroom Explorer.
The problem states that, Perform metal displacement reactions.
Arrange the given metals from strongest to weakest reducing agent.
Stockroom Explorer is provided with all the required metals and their salt solutions.
Let us define Redox Reactions.
Oxidation is loss of electrons by any species.
Metal displacement reactions are a type of Redox reactions.
In metal displacement reactions, a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal in a metal salt solution.
This slide shows the activity series of some metals used in displacement reactions.
Here is an example of metal displacement reaction.
Silver ions in silver nitrate can be replaced by copper to form copper nitrate.
Elemental silver is precipitated in the reaction.
Switch to application window
Right-click on the workbench tab to rename.
Let us now demonstrate the reactivity of Magnesium metal.
From the Stockroom Explorer, click on Solids cabinet, double-click on  Magnesium.
Click on Solutions cabinet, double-click on,
Close the cabinets.
Click on Glassware menu, and select 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask
We need 4 flasks for this experiment.
Rename the flasks with corresponding metal symbols, Zinc, Lead , Silver and Copper.
Arrange the apparatus and chemicals.
The Solution Info panel shows the bottle contains 50 ml of solution.
Pour the contents of the bottles into respective flasks using Precise transfer mode.
Type 50 in the Transfer amount input bar.
Similarly transfer contents of the bottles into flasks.
Keep the empty bottles aside.
Click on each Erlenmeyer flask and note the concentration of the metal ions.
Pour 1 gram of solid Magnesium metal in each flask using Precise transfer mode.
Click on the flask containing copper nitrate .
Temperature increases on addition, then decreases.
In the Solution Info Panel, concentration of copper ions is zero.
Magnesium ions are observed in the solution.
Click on Solid radio button.
This is because Magnesium has higher oxidation potential  than copper.
Click on the flask containing Zinc nitrate.
Click on Aqueous radio button on the Solution Info Panel.
Magnesium ions are now observed.
Observe that Zinc is now found in the solution.
Magnesium has replaced Zinc ions from its solution.
Click on the flask containing lead nitrate.
Magnesium has replaced Lead ions from its solution.
Click on the flask containing silver nitrate.
Magnesium has replaced Silver ions from its solution.
Now let us  demonstrate the activity of Zinc.
Rename the workbench as Zinc-reaction.
From Solids cabinet select Zinc.
Click on Solutions cabinet and select
Close the cabinets.
As we did in the previous experiment, take 4 Erlenmeyer flasks.
Rename the flasks with corresponding metal symbols Magnesium, Lead, Copper and Silver.
Pour the contents of the bottles into the respective flasks.
Pour 1 g of solid Zinc metal in each flask.
Type 1 in the Transfer amount input bar.
Click on the flask containing copper nitrate.
Observe that Copper is displaced by Zinc.
Click on the flask containing Magnesium nitrate.
Zinc cannot replace Magnesium from the solution.
Hence, there is no reaction and Zinc remains in the solution.
Similarly click on flasks containing Lead nitrate and Silver nitrate.
Similarly perform the experiments for Lead, Copper and Silver.
Rename the workbenches as Lead-reaction, Copper-reaction and Silver-reaction.
Required metals and salt solutions are available in the Stockroom Explorer.
We have performed these experiments.
Here are the observations.
We have tabulated the results as shown.
Magnesium displaces metal ions, Zinc, lead, Copper and silver which have lower oxidation potentials.
Silver with lowest oxidation potential cannot displace,
The order of reactivity from strongest to weakest reducing agents is as follows.
Let us summarize
As an assignment, Perform displacement reactions using solutions of metal halides.
Establish the order of reactivity of halogens.
The required chemicals are available in the  Stockroom Explorer.

get variable is a very useful variable type.
It is used for most of the  dynamic website with forms that have click-able buttons.
The action is going to be in the same page that we're working with. This method is going to equal 'GET' because that's the method we're using. Finally, you can end your form like that.
I'll start quoting underneath this HTML. It is possible to incorporate Php and HTML on one page. So long as it is not between Php tags. Unless it's in an echo function.
So,that's the end of the get variable.
In my next tutorial, I will talk about the post variable and its uses. This is Anoushka for the Spoken Tutorial Project. Thanks for watching.
Capital ORS defines the output record separator.
Capital OFS defines the output field separator.
newline is the default value for record separator RS variable.
Notice that all the fields are separated by the pipe symbol.
Here, in the BEGIN section, we have assigned the value of FS as a pipe symbol.
Suppose we want colon as the output field separator
If true, then  print section will print the record’s line number NR, along with the entire line denoted by $0.
In the output, we can see that record number 16 is the incomplete record.
Let us see one more example.
Let’s try something else now.
Let us now look at some other built-in variables.
This is because, this command prints the filename once for each row in the awkdemo.txt file.
Clear the terminal.
There are some other built-in variables in awk.
For doing so, we need to use hyphen small f option.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Classes and Objects in C++.
Classes
Objects Encapsulation and
Data abstraction.
We will do this with the help of an example.
Ubuntu OS version 11.10
g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with the introduction to classes.
Class is created using a keyword class.
It holds data and functions.
Class links the code and data.
The data and functions of the class are called as members of the class.
Let us move on to objects.
Objects are variables.
They are the copy of a class.
Each of them has properties and behavior.
Properties are defined through data elements and
behavior is defined through member functions called methods.
Now let us see the syntax for a class.
Here, class is a keyword used to define a class.
Class-name is the name of the class.
public, private and protected are the access specifier.
And here we have defined the data members and the member functions as public, private and protected.
This is how we close the class.
Now let us see an example.
Note that our filename is  class hyphen obj dot cpp
In this example, we will calculate the area of a square using class.
This is declaration for a class named square.
Here, I have not declared any access specifier.
So, by default it is private.
Hence, variable x is a private member of class square.
This is the public specifier.
Function area is a public function.
And this is how we close the class.
Now let us move back to our slides to know more about the access specifiers.
Public specifier-
The public specifier allows the data to be accessed outside the class.
A public member can be used anywhere in the program.
Private specifier-
The members declared as private cannot be used or accessed outside the class.
private members can be used only by the members of the class.
Protected specifier-
protected members cannot be accessed from outside the class.
They can be accessed by a derived class.
Let us move back to our program.
Here, in this statement we have the class name,
the scope resolution operator and the function name.
We must use this operator.
It specifies that function area is not a global function.
It is a member function of class square.
Here, we have passed an argument as int a.
Now, let us switch back to our slides to know more about the scope resolution operator.
It is used to access the hidden data.
To access the variable or function with the same name, we use the scope resolution  operator ::.
Suppose the local variable and the global variable have same name.
The local variable gets the priority.
We can access the global variable using  ::(scope resolution operator.)
Now, switch to our program.
Here the value of a is stored in x.
Then we return the area of the square.
Here x is a private member.
To access the private parameter, we used the public member a.
private members are always hidden.
This is our main function.
Here, sqr is the object of class square.
This is how we create an object.
class-name followed by the object-name.
Here, we call the function area using the object sqr and a .(dot) operator.
Then we pass an argument as 4.
We set the value of x as 4.
This is our return statement.Now click on Save.
To compile, type: g++ space class hyphen obj dot cpp space hyphen o space class
Type./class(dot slash class).
Press Enter.The output is displayed as:
Area of the square is 16
Now, let us move back to our program.
So far now we have seen,
the data and functions combined together in a class.
class is a single unit
in which the data and the function using them is grouped.
This mechanism is called as Encapsulation.
Then we have seen class with the  private and public members.
The private data is hidden.
It cannot be accessed outside the class.
This mechanism is called as Data abstraction.
The interface is seen but the implementation is hidden.
Let us move back to our slides. Let us summarize.
Encapsulation Data Abstraction
Private members
int x;
Public functions int area(int);
classes class square
To create object,
square sqr;
To call a function using object sqr dot area();
As an assignment: write a program to find the perimeter of a given circle.

Hello Everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Installation of LibreOffice Suite.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to install LibreOffice Suite in Linux OS.
To record this tutorial, I'm using:
To follow this tutorial, in Linux OS, one should be familiar with:
If not, please refer to the relevant tutorials in the Linux series on this website.
Let us begin with the installation of LibreOffice Suite.
LibreOffice Suite can be downloaded and installed using Synaptic Package Manager.
Refer to the relevant tutorial in the Linux spoken tutorial series to know more.
Next, let us learn how to install LibreOffice Suite using the terminal.
First, I will open Firefox web browser.
In the address bar, type:  www.LibreOffice.org/download and press Enter.
We are immediately redirected to the download page.
Here you can see the Download button to download LibreOffice Suite.
By default, the latest version of LibreOffice for our default OS is displayed here.
In my case, I’m recording on Linux OS. So, it shows the latest version of LibreOffice for Linux.
But we can download this software as suitable for our OS version.
How do we change the OS or LibreOffice version? Just click on the link “change”, located just above the Download button.
We are redirected to another page. Here, we can see the Download option for various OSs. We can select the one suitable for our need.
Here, we can also choose the version of LibreOffice Suite that we want to install.
I will choose Linux x64 in bracket deb as I have a 64-bit Ubuntu Linux machine.
On doing this, we are once again redirected to the download page.
Note that the default version of LibreOffice and OS is now as per our selection.
Let us click on the Download button.
On doing so, a Save As dialog box opens.
Click on the OK button and the download will start. This may take some time, depending upon the internet speed.
When the download is complete, open the terminal. We can do so by pressing Ctrl, Alt, T keys simultaneously on the keyboard.
In the terminal, type: cd space Downloads and press Enter.
Then type: ls and press Enter.
We can see a downloaded 'LibreOffice suite' file in tar.gz format.
Now I'll clear the screen by pressing Ctrl + L keys.
Then type: tar space -zxvf space and the file name and press Enter.
Then type: cd space file name and press Enter.
Now type: cd in caps DEBS and press Enter.
At the end, type: sudo space dpkg -i space *.deb and press Enter.
Type the password of your system and press Enter.
After pressing Enter, the installation of LibreOffice Suite will begin.
The installation will take some time. Once the installation is complete, close the terminal.
Go to dash home and type office in the search bar field.
You'll see various LibreOffice Suite components like-  Base, Calc, Impress, Writer, Draw and Math.
This indicates that the LibreOffice Suite is successfully installed on your Linux system.
That’s all for this tutorial. Let us summarize.
In this tutorial, we learned how to install LibreOffice Suite in Ubuntu Linux OS.

Welcome to Meet The GIMP.
Here is Threshold which defines how much difference between the colours is allowed to be in the selection or when something is out of selection.
The next important selection is, which mode do you want to have in the selection.
You can select the Red, the Green, the Blue channel or the Hue, Saturation or the Value channel as the base for your selection.
So, when I now click into the selection second time, the selection is selected.
Now, I look around in the selection.
So, this is the fairly intelligent scissors.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Variables and operators in awk command.
Operators,
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04
To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier Linux tutorials on this website.
You should be familiar with basic operators used in general programming languages like C or C++.
awk combines the power of a filter and a programming language.
So, it supports variables, constants, operators etc.
Let’s see what a variable in awk is.
A variable is an identifier that references a value.
Awk supports both user-defined variables and built-in variables.
We will learn about user-defined variables in this tutorial.
For user-defined variables, variable declaration is not required.
Variables do not have to be initialized explicitly.
Awk automatically initializes them to zero or null string.
A variable must begin with a letter and continue with letters, digits and underscores.
So, Salary with capital “S” and salary with small “s” are two different variables.
Let us look at some examples now.
Open the terminal by pressing CTRL + ALT and T keys.
On the terminal, type- awk space opening single quote opening curly brace small x equal to 1 semicolon capital X equal to within double quotes capital A semicolon small a equal to within double quotes awk semicolon small b equal to within double quotes tutorial.
Type: print x, press Enter.
print capital X, press Enter.
print a, press Enter.
print b, press Enter.
print a space b, press Enter.
print small x space b, press Enter.
print small x plus capital X closing curly brace closing single quote and press Enter.
Since we have not given a filename, awk would need some input from standard input.
And hence, we can type any letter, say a and then press Enter.
This example shows a couple of things.
It can also be initialized with value as a single character or a string.
If the value is a character or a string, variable is initialized with value within double quotes.
We can see the values of the variables.
Observe that small x and capital X are treated as different variables.
This proves that variables are case sensitive.
Also, it shows how two strings can be concatenated.
Here variables small a and small b are concatenated.
So, string concatenation operator is simply a space.
Similarly, when we concatenate small x which is a number and string b, x is auto-converted into string.
Why does the auto-conversion to string happen?
That's because awk finds a string concatenation operator space here, between x and b.
Now, look at the output of small x plus capital X.
So, X is auto-converted to numeric zero.
Until now, we have seen a couple of operators.
A variety of operators can be used in expressions.
Please pause the video here and take a look at all the operators mentioned here.
I assume you are familiar with these basic operators.
If not, then kindly visit our website for tutorials on operators in C and C++ series.
I am not going to discuss the working of all these operators in detail.
Only exception is the string matching operator which may be new to you.
A file named awkdemo.txt has been provided in the Code files link.
Let me clear the terminal.
Now, go to the folder in which you have saved the awkdemo.txt file using the cd command.
Let us have a look at this file now.
Let's say we want to find the students who have passed but have marks less than 80.
In this case, we need to compare two different fields.
For such situations, we can use awk's relational operators.
These operators can compare both strings and numbers.
So, on the terminal, type:
This command shows a number of things.
Second, we only compare the fourth field with a number.
Third, we see that we can join two or more comparisons using ampersand operator.
Instead of specific numbers or strings, we can also compare regular expressions.
As we have seen in the slide, we have the tilde and the exclamation tilde operators for this purpose.
Now suppose, we want to find computer science students who have passed.
Since computers can have both a small and capital C, we would use a regular expression.
We would type:
If we want to negate the comparison, we can do so using the exclamation tilde operator.
Say, now we want a list of all non-computer students who have passed.
Use the up-arrow to get the previous command.
Next to dollar 3 add exclamation symbol and press Enter.
Next, let's count the number of blank lines in the same file.
Open the file and check how many blank lines are there.
Now to count the number of empty lines using awk, type:
We got 3 as our final answer.
The caret sign signifies start of a line while dollar signifies the end of a line.
Hence, an empty line would be matched by the regular expression caret-dollar.
Note, we have not initialized the value of x.
This command gives us the running count of blank lines.
In our last command, we have seen running count of blank lines.
Then we need to print x only once, after the entire file has been traversed.
We may also want to give a heading saying what the output means.
For such requirements, awk provides the BEGIN and the END sections.
The BEGIN section contains procedures for pre-processing.
This section is executed before the main input loop is executed.
The END section can contain procedures for post-processing.
This section is executed after the main input loop has terminated.
Let's learn how to do this.
within front slash caret symbol dollar symbol space within curly braces x equal to x plus 1
end space within curly braces print space x close single quote space awkdemo.txt and press Enter.
See, we did not get the desired output!
What do you think happened?
So, let us modify the command.
Press the up-arrow key to get the previous executed command on the terminal.
Now, modify lower case end to upper case END.
Now the total number of empty lines is displayed in the output.
Next, let's find the average salary of all the students that we found in the awkdemo.txt file.
To get that, type the command as shown in the terminal and press Enter.
Operators,
As an assignment, print every line where the value of the last field is more than 5000.
Print the average marks of all the students with the heading “Average marks” in the output.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Constructors and Destructors in C++.
Constructors Types of constructors
Destructors.We will do this with the help of some examples.
g++ Compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with an introduction to Constructor.
A constructor is a member function.
It has the same name as the class name.
Constructors cannot return values.
It is automatically called when an object is created.
Types of Constructors :
Parameterized Constructors
Copy Constructors and
Default Constructors.
Let us move on to Destructors.
Destructors are used to deallocate memory.
They are called when an object is destroyed.
A destructor takes no arguments and has no return types.
Let us see an example on Constructors and Destructors.
I have already typed the code on the editor, I will open it.
Note that our filename is cons hyphen dest dot cpp.
In this program, we will perform the addition of two numbers using constructor.
Here we have used std namespace.
Then we have class Addition. a and b are the integer variables.
These are the private members of class Addition.
Here we have the Public specifier.
Then we have the construtor Addition.
The constructor has the same name as the class name.
We have passed two arguements here.
Now we have defined a Destructor.
For this we use a tilde sign followed by the destructors name.
This is a public function add.
It returns sum of a and b.
Here, we access the constructor using the scope resolution operator.
a and b are private members.
To access the private members, we use x and y.
Then we access the destructor.
In this, we print "Memory Deallocation".
This is our main function.
Here, we create an object obj of class Addition.
Then we pass two arguments as 3 and 4.
3 will be stored in x and 4 will be stored in y.
This means as value is 3 and 'b's value is 4.
The constructor that has arguments is called parameterized constructor.
Hence this one is the prameterized constructor.
Here, we call the function add using the object obj.
And we print the sum.
This is our return statement.
To compile, type: g++ space cons hyphen dest dot cpp space hyphen o space cons
Type: dot slash cons
Sum is 7 and Memory Deallocation.
Now let us see an example on Default constructors.
Note that our file name is default dot cpp.
If a constructor is not declared in the class
then the compiler assumes a default constructor for the class.
Here we have used std namespace.
Then we have class Subtraction.
Then we have a and b declared as public.
Here, we have sub function.
We have passed two arguments int a and int b.
This returns the subtraction of two numbers a and b.
This is the defalut constructor.
Here, we access the default constructor using the scope resolution operator.
This is our main function.
In this, we have defined a variable x.
Here we create an object 's' of class subtraction.
Then we call the function sub using the object s.
And pass two arguments as 8 and 4.
The result is stored in variable x.
And here we print the difference.
This is our return statement .
Let us compile, type: g++ space default dot cpp space hyphen o space def
Press Enter. Type: dot slash def
The output is returned as:
Difference is 4.
Here you can see that we have passed the arguments within the function.
And in our previous example, we have passed the arguments within the Object.
And here we have passed the arguments using the Object.
Now, let us go back to our slides.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial we learned:
Constructor. eg. Addition
Parameterized Constructor. eg. Addition obj (3, 4);
Destructor. eg. ~Addition
Default Constructor. eg. Subtraction
As an assignment, create a class named Division.
Create a constructor for the class.
And create a function divide which divides two given numbers.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on RESTful API with a REST Client.
In this tutorial, we will learn about REST client.
We also learn to use the REST client to  Retrieve data using GET method
Create a new node using POST method
Modify an existing node using PATCH method and
Delete an existing node using DELETE method
To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 16.04
Drupal 8
Postman as a REST client and  Firefox web browser
You can use any REST client and web browser as per your choice.
To practise this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Drupal.
The RESTful API should have been implemented in your Drupal website.
If not, please go through the previous Drupal tutorials on this website.
First we will confirm whether RESTful API is implemented in our Drupal8 site.
Then go to Structure and Views.
Here you can see that RESTful API is implemented in the Events content type.
Note that we have already learnt to implement the RESTful API earlier.
Now we will learnt to check our RESTful API using a REST client.
I will use Postman as a REST client.
You can use any REST client as per your choice.
Postman is a powerful HTTP client for testing web services.
To install the Postman client, refer to the Additional reading material link of this tutorial.
The following steps are applicable to Bitnami Drupal Stack.
But most of the steps are applicable to any other Drupal installation, as well.
Let us open the Postman client.
First we will learn to retrieve data for Anonymous users using GET method.
Choose GET from the drop-down list.
Recall that earlier we had implemented the RESTful API on our Events content type.
We will now enter the path of our RESTful API.
Here localhost:8080 is my server name.
If you are not using Bitnami Drupal stack, please use localhost instead of localhost:8080.
drupal is the folder of my Drupal instance.
events is the content type on which we have configured the RESTful API.
Now click on the Send button at the top right corner.
You can see here the contents of our events content type in json format.
Next let us learn to retrieve a single node.
Click on the plus button at the top panel to add a new tab.
Choose GET from the dropdown list.
We have to give the exact path of the particular node.
Click on the Send button. You can see here the content of that particular node is retrieved.
Next let us learn to create a new node for Authenticated users using POST method.
Click on the plus button at the top panel to add a new tab.
Choose POST from the drop-down list.
Type the path as shown. Here localhost:8080 is my server name.
drupal is the folder of my Drupal instance.
We have to hard-code the rest of the things.
Under Authorization, we will change the Type as Basic Authentication.
Now we will give the username and password of our Drupal website.
Click on the Preview Request button at the left hand side to update our request.
Click on the Headers tab. Here you can see the token for the basic authentication.
We will set the Content-Type to application/hal+json.
Now we will go to the Body tab.
Let us change the data format as raw.
Here we must declare the required title and type fields.
This json code is used to create a new code of the type events.
For that we specify the values for title and body fields.
The same code is given in the Code files link of this tutorial.
Click on the Send button at the top right corner.
If the content is successfully posted, you can see the json code of this content at the bottom.
We can also check the content in our Drupal website.
Switch back to our Drupal site.
Here you can see the event which is posted from the Postman client.
Note that the UID of this post is 100.
We will use this UID in the postman client to modify this node.
Next let us learn to modify a node for Authenticated users using PATCH method.
Let us switch back to the Postman client.
Click on the plus button at the top panel to add a new tab.
Choose PATCH from the drop-down list.
We will enter the URL of the node which we want to modify.
For example, we will modify the node which we created using POST method.
The UID of this post is 100. We will enter the URL of the node 100.
Under Authorization, we will change the Type as Basic Authentication.
Now we will give the username and password of our Drupal website.
Click on the Preview Request button at the left hand side.
Click on the Headers tab. Here you can see the token for the basic authentication.
We will set the Content-Type to application/hal+json.
Now we will go to the Body tab.
Change the data format as raw.
And type the following code here.
In this code we modify the values for both the title and the body fields.
The same code is given in the Code files link of this tutorial.
Then click on the Send button at the top right corner.
You can see the Status as 200 OK which means the content is modified.
Let us check the content in our Drupal website.
Switch back to our Drupal website. Let us refresh the page.
Here you can see that the event is successfully modified using the PATCH method.
Next let us learn to delete an existing node for Authenticated users using DELETE method.
I will choose node 100 which was created by me as an authenticated user.
Remember that we have permitted the authenticated users to delete their own content only.
Switch back to the Postman client. Click on the plus button to add a new tab.
Choose DELETE from the drop-down list.
We will enter the URL of the node which we want to delete.
Under Authorization, we will change the Type as Basic Authentication.
Now we will give the username and password of our Drupal website.
Click on the Preview Request button at the left hand side.
Then click on the Headers tab.
We will set the Content-Type to application/hal+json.
Click on the Send button at the top right corner.
You can see the Status as 204 No content which means the content is deleted.
Switch back to our Drupal site.
Let us refresh the page.
We can see that the node is successfully deleted.
This is all about managing content through Postman client.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about-  Postman client as a REST client and
Managing content through Postman client using GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE methods
As an assignment -  Create some new articles through REST client and  Modify the articles using PATCH method

Welcome to this tutorial on Surface Properties in Chimera.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: show surfaces for protein and DNA structures,
create images of protein surface colored by : Amino acid hydrophobicity and Electrostatic Potential.
Mozilla firefox browser 42.0 and a working internet connection.
Here I have opened the Chimera window.
Open a structure of RTX CPD toxin using command line.
Open the command line using Favorites menu.
On the command line text box,
3eeb is the pdb code for RTX CPD toxin.
The protein structure is displayed on the panel. It contains two copies of the protein.
Type commands on the command line to delete one of the copies, that is chain A.
On the command line text box , type: delete colon dot a. Press Enter.
Observe the panel, one of the copies of the enzyme is deleted.
Protease domain is bound to ligand inositol hexakisphosphate.
Next, delete the solvent molecules, present as red dots near the ligand.
To delete the sodium ion which is present along with the ligand,
Now we can display the structure of the protein using Presets option.
Click on  Presets option in the menu bar.
Select Interactive 3, hydrophobicity surface.
This will display a molecular surface color-coded by amino acid hydrophobicity.
Blue for the most polar residues,
Orange red for the most hydrophobic and white for neutral residues.
Proteins generally interact with other proteins and molecules via their surface regions.
Representing a protein by its molecular surface helps in: the study of protein folding,
prediction of biomolecular recognition,
detection of drug binding cavities and Molecular Graphics.
Next, to display electrostatic potential surface for the protein,
click on the Tools menu, scroll down to Surface\Binding Analysis.
From the sub-menu, choose coulombic surface coloring.
A Coulombic Surface Coloring dialog box opens.
The colors and associated values can be changed.
Default settings work well most of the time. Click on  OK button.
On the panel, we have the protein showing electrostatic potential surface.
Red color for negative potential, blue for positive potential and white for neutral.
Now, let's see how to create high quality images for publication, presentations etc:
Make the sticks of the inositol ligand a little thicker using the command Set attribute:
Use publication preset for nice image settings.
Again scroll down the Presets menu, select Publication 1.
This will create an image with a white background, black outlines and increased smoothness of the edges.
At this point, we can adjust other parameters such as thickness of the line, lighting etc.
Click on Tools menu, scroll down and click on Viewing Controls.
Click on lighting from the sub-menu.
A Viewing window opens with tabs to change different viewing settings:
such as Camera, Sideview, Rotation, Effects, Lighting.

Close the current session. Click on File menu.  Scroll down and click on Close Session option.
Open the graphics window.  Fetch the structure of the DNA using command line.
On the command line text box,  type: open 1d86 , press Enter.
The structure is of a double helical DNA with a molecule of netropsin bound to it.
Netropsin is a polyamide with antibiotic and antiviral properties.
Initially this structure is shown as ribbons.
The nucleic acid sugars and bases are shown as tube and slab representations.
Scroll down the presets menu and click on interactive 2 option.
This will show the DNA as wire and netropsin as spheres.
Type command to remove solvent: delete space solvent . Press Enter.'
To show the surface for this structure, scroll down the Actions menu, select surface.
Observe the panel. The DNA structure is now displayed with the surface.
Major groove and minor groove are clearly seen in this picture.
The ligand, netropsin is seen bound in the minor groove.
There are 3 different ways to display surfaces.
Scroll down the Action menu, select Surface . Sub-menu has 3 options :  Solid, mesh and dot.
By default, surface is shown as solid.
Click on mesh to display mesh surface.
Click on dot to display the dot surface.
Click on solid to get back to solid surface.
We can adjust the degree of transparency for the solid surface.
Go on Actions menu again, click on Surface.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Operations on Matrices and Data Frames.
Perform operations on matrices
Add rows or columns to a data frame
To understand this tutorial, you should know
Data frames and Matrices in R
R script in RStudio
How to set working directory in RStudio
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use the data frame CaptaincyData.csv and the script file myMatrix.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to MatrixOps folder' in myProject folder on the Desktop.
I have also set MatrixOps folder as my Working directory.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
Open the script myMatrix.R in RStudio.
For this, click on the script myMatrix.R
Script myMatrix.R opens in Rstudio.
Recall that, we had created a matrix named matrixA.
This matrix was extracted as a subset from the captaincy data frame.
We will use matrixA here also.
Run this script myMatrix.R to load the values in the Workspace.
captaincy data frame opens in the Source window.
I will resize the Source window.
Now let us learn how to find the inverse of matrixA.
Click on the script myMatrix.R
In the Source window, type solve, within parentheses matrixA.
Press Enter. Press Enter at the end of every command.
Save the script and run this line.
The inverse of matrixA in shown in the Console window.
For more information on calculating inverse of a matrix in R, please refer to the Additional materials section on this website.
Now let us calculate the sum of all the elements in matrixA.
First, we shall use nested for loops for calculating this sum.
Also, we shall estimate the time taken to calculate the sum in this way.
Let us add a comment - Calculating sum using for loop in the script.
In the Source window, type # hash space Calculating sum using for loop.
Press Enter. To calculate the time taken, we record the present time.
In the Source window, type start Time with capital T.
Then press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously.
Next, type Sys dot time followed by parentheses.
Sys.time() is used to find the absolute date-time value in the current time.
Let us initialise a variable totalSum.
In the Source window, type totalSum
then press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously. Then type zero.
This variable will store the sum of elements in matrixA.
Now, we will create two for loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the matrixA.
In the Source window, type for in parentheses i space in space 1 colon 3 space
Now type opening curly bracket. RStudio automatically adds a closing curly bracket.
Press Enter just after the opening curly bracket and type the following command.
Press Enter after the closing curly bracket of outer loop for(i in 1:3).
In the Source window, type print totalSum in parentheses.
Now, we record the current time again.
Type endTime then press Alt and -(hyphen) keys simultaneously. Type Sys dot time parentheses.
Press Enter. Type endTime space minus sign space startTime to know the total time taken.
I am resizing the Source window.
Run the block of code from the comment line Calculating sum using for loop to the end.
The totalSum is evaluated to be 237.
The time taken to calculate the sum of elements in matrixA using for loop is approximately 8 milliseconds.
However, it may vary from system to system.
Now, let us calculate the sum of all elements in matrixA using the sum function.
We shall estimate the time taken to calculate the sum in this way also.
In the script myMatrix.R, add a comment Calculating sum using inbuilt function.
In the Source window, type # hash space Calculating sum using inbuilt function.
Now, type the following commands.
Save the script and run the block of code from the comment line Calculating sum using inbuilt function to the end.
The time taken to calculate the sum of elements using sum function is 1.6 milliseconds.
Whereas, it took 8 milliseconds to calculate the same sum using for loop.
So, it is advisable to use inbuilt functions of R.
Let us learn how to calculate sum of each row and sum of each column.
In the Source window, type rowSums matrixA in parentheses.
Next, type colSums matrixA in parentheses.
Save the script and run these two lines to see the corresponding sums on the Console.
I am resizing the Console window to see the output properly.
Now let us learn how to add rows and columns to an existing data frame.
Click on the captaincy data frame.
Let us add a new row to the captaincy data frame.
Click on the script myMatrix.R
In the Source window, type the following command. Press Enter .
Press Enter after the comma for better visibility.
I am resizing the Source window
We have used rbind() function with the following arguments
name of the data frame to which we want to add the new row. Here, it is captaincy.
the row to be added as an argument to data.frame().
To data.frame() function, we provide the values according to the columns of the actual data frame.
names = “Kohli”
Y = 2016
played = 30
won = 20
lost = 9
victory = 20/30
In the Source window, type View within parentheses captaincy
Save the script and run the last two lines of code.
One new row with the details of Kohli is added in the captaincy data frame.
Now let us create a new column named defeat in the captaincy data frame.
Click on the script myMatrix.R.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Press Enter. Now we add defeat as a new column in captaincy data frame.
In the Source window, type the following command Press Enter.
We have used cbind() function with following two arguments:
name of the data frame to which we want to add the new column.
Here, it is captaincy.  name of the column to be added. Here, it is defeat.
Now type View, captaincy in parentheses
Save the script and run the block of code starting from the declaration of defeat to the end.
defeat column is added in the captaincy data frame.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learned how to:
Perform operation on matrices
Add rows or columns to a data frame
We now suggest an assignment.
Consider 2 vectors (9,10,11,12) and (13,14,15,16).
Create a 4 by 2 matrix from these two vectors.
Add another vector (17,18,19,20) as a column to the previous matrix.

Hi everybody.Welcome to the  tutorial on introduction to Developing Web Applications on the Netbeans IDE.
If not, please visit the Spoken Tutorial website for relevant tutorials on Netbeans.
Having viewed the first tutorial, you would already be familiar
with the installation and interface of Netbeans.
The previous tutorial also teaches you how to create a new project.
This tutorial will take you through the basics of using Netbeans  to develop web applications.
We will see - Setting up a web-application project
Creating and editing web-applications source files
Creating a java package and a java source file
Generating the Getter and Setter methods
Editing the default Java Server Pages file
Creating a JavaServer pages file and
finally running our web-application project.
To follow this tutorial, you will need: * the Netbeans IDE
The Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6
The GlassFish Server Open Source Edition.
All the above can be downloaded in a single bundle from the link shown on the screen.
This tutorial demonstrates how to create a simple web application,
deploy it to a server,
and view its presentation in a browser.
The application employs (JSP)  Java Server Pages, to ask you, to input your name.
It then uses JavaBeans component to persist the name during the HTTP session
and then retrieves the  output on a second JSP page.
Let us now move to Netbeans and create our web-application project.
Under Categories, select Java Web.
Under Projects, select Web Application and click Next.
Give your project a name. I will name my project as "HelloWeb".
Specify the Project Location to any directory on your computer.
The Server and Settings panel opens.
Select the version of Java you want to use with your application.
And, select the server, you want to deploy your application to.
In the Frameworks panel,
click Finish to create the project.
The IDE creates the HelloWeb project folder.
This folder contains all of your sources and project metadata.
The welcome page- index.jsp, opens in the Source Editor in the main window.
You can view the project's file structure in the Files window on the left, here,
and it's logical structure in the Projects window.
Creating and editing source files is the most important function that the IDE serves.
Now in the Projects window, expand the Source Packages node.
Note that the Source Packages node contains only  an empty "default package" node.
Right-click on the Source Packages  and choose New > Java Class.
Give your class a name. I will name the class as "NameHandler"
and in the Package combo-box, let me type: "org.mypackage.hello"
The NameHandler.java file opens in the Source editor.
Now, let's declare a String variable directly below the class declaration.
I will declare a string variable 'String name' and
I will also add a constructor public NameHandler() to the class.
Now, let me also  add name = null; within the constructor.
Let us next generate the Getter and Setter Methods.
Right-click the name field in the Source Editor, choose Refactor  and  Encapsulate Fields  from the contextual menu.
Refactoring is a disciplined technique for improving the structure of the existing code, without changing the observable behavior.
In short, you can change the structure of the code without changing the behavior.
With Refactoring, you can easily move fields, methods or classes around, without breaking things.
Let's move back to the IDE.
The Encapsulate Fields dialog-box opens, listing the name field.
Notice that the Fields Visibility is  set to "private"
and the Accessors Visibility is set to "public", by default,
indicating that the access modifier for the class variables will be specified as private
whereas the getter and setter methods will be generated with 'public' modifiers respectively.
Click on Refactor.
The Getter and Setter methods are generated for the name field.
The modifier for the class variable is set to "private" whereas the  getter and setter methods are generated with "public" modifier.
Your java class should finally look like this.
Let us next edit the Default JavaServer Pages File.
Let us refocus the 'index.jsp' file by clicking its tab, displayed at the top of the Source editor.
Now, let us open the Palette manager by going to the Tools menu > Palette and click on HTML/JSP code clips.
The Palette manager opens.
In the palette manager, expand the HTML Forms option.
Select the Form item.
Drag it and drop it to a point after the h1 tags, in your Source Editor.
The Insert Form dialog-box opens.
Let us specify the values as being shown on the screen:
the Action as  "response.jsp",
the Method as "GET".
And, let's  give our form a name as "Name Input Form".
An HTML form is added to the 'index.jsp' file.
Now, from the Palette manager, select a Text Input item, drag it and drop it to a point just before the closing form tags.
In the Insert Text Input dialog-box, specify the Name as "name".
Leave the Type at text
and click on OK.
A HTML input tag is now added between the form tags.
Let us delete the empty 'value' attribute from the input tag.
Now, from the palette, select the Button item.
Drag it and drop it to the point, before the closing form tag.
Specify the Label as "OK",
the Type as "submit"
and click on OK again.
An HTML button is now added to a  form tags.
Infront of the first input tag, let us enter the text "Enter your name".
And, let us  change the default text between the h1  tags.
We will change the text to "Entry form".
Now, right-click. Let me close the palette manager, for now.
Right-click within your Source Editor.
Select the Format option to tidy the format of your code.
Your 'index.jsp' file should now look like this.
Let us next create a JavaServer Pages file.
In the Projects window, right-click on the HelloWeb project node, choose New > JSP.
The New JSP file wizard opens.
Name the file as "response" and click on Finish.
Notice that a 'response.jsp' file node displays in the Projects window, beneath the index.jsp file
and the new file opens in the Source Editor.
Open the Palette manager again.
Now, expand the JSP option.
Select a Use Bean item, drag it and drop it to a point just below the body tag.
The Insert Use Bean dialog opens.
Specify the values as-
the ID as mybean,
the Class as "org.mypackage.hello.NameHandler".
Set the Scope as session
and click on OK.
Notice that a jsp:useBean tag is added beneath the body tag.
JavaBeans are reusable software components for Java.
They are used to encapsulate many objects into a single object
so that they can be passed around as a single bean object instead of multiple individual objects.
Now, from the Palette manager, select a Set Bean property item, drag it and drop it  to a point just before the h1 tags
and click on OK.
Here, in the jsp:setProperty tag that appears, delete the empty "value" attribute
and set the name attribute to "mybean" and the Property to "name".
Now, in between the h1 tags, let us change the text to Hello comma space and an exclamation mark.
Now, from the Palette manager, select a Get Bean property  item. Drag it and drop it after the "Hello" text  in between the h1 tags.
In the Get Bean Property item,
set the Bean Name to "mybean"
and the Property Name to "name".
Click on OK.
Notice that jsp:getProperty tag is now added between the h1 tags.
Right-click within the Source Editor again. Click on  Format to tidy the format of your code, if required.
The next step is to run our Web Application Project.
Let me close the Palette manager.
In the Projects window, right-click the "HelloWeb" project node and choose the Run option.
You can also click the Run option from the toolbar or press F6 key on your keyboard to run your Project.
I will select the button on the toolbar to run my Project.
When you run a Web application, the IDE builds and compiles the application code,
launches the server and deploys the application to the server
and finally displays the application in a browser window.
To view these processes, you can open the output window from the Window menu and select the Output option.
You can see that your application has been  built successfully.
The 'index.jsp' page opens in your default browser.
Let me run the project again.
Here it is! It opens in your default browser.
Note that the browser window may sometimes open before the IDE displays the server output.
Now, let us enter the name in the text-box, in the browser.
For e.g. Ubuntu and click on OK.
The 'response.jsp' page displays, providing you with a simple greeting.
Now, to the assignment part-
As an extension to the web-application project, insert two more text fields, that is, totally three input text fields in your application.
Use the JavaBeans component to set the bean property and
view its presentation in the browser.
And finally, retrieve the output on the second JSP page.
I have already constructed my assignment.
Let me open my assignment and run it in the  IDE.
I am presented with 3 input text fields.
Let me enter the details and click on OK.
I should be presented with an output like this.
If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Updating Data.
In this tutorial, we will learn about Update statement and Delete statement.
PostgreSQL 9.3.x
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of SELECT statement.
For more details, refer to the RDBMS PostgreSQL series on this website.
The update query is used to modify the existing records in a table.
We have to use the WHERE clause with the UPDATE statement to update the selected rows.
The syntax for update statement is shown here.
Column1 would be assigned the value1 and Column2 would be assigned the value2 and so on.
Other columns in the table will retain their previous values.
WHERE clause is used to find the exact row based on the specified condition to update it.
If no conditions are provided then all records in the table will be updated.
Let's switch to pgAdmin main screen.
Now, right-click on students node, then on View data and then on View All rows.
Notice here - it says the student whose id is 's008', is from 'Chennai' city.
Now I want to change the city to 'Bangalore' for this student.
Now, switch to the SQL editor window and type the update statement as shown here.
This is a simple update statement which updates a single column.
The existing city value 'Chennai' will be changed to 'Bangalore' for the studentid s008.
Execute the query.
Let's retrieve the record to see the changes.
Clear the editor window and type this select statement.
Now, execute the query to see the output.
Next we will see how to update multiple columns.
Type the code. We can also update multiple columns by separating the column and value pairs, with commas, as shown here.
Remember, the date of birth column was null for the student 'Ram charan'.
This will update two columns, date of birth and city, with the values given in the update statement.
What will happen if you forget to give the where condition?
The entire students table will be updated with the given value.
Execute the query.
Let us see the updated value for the student name ‘Ram Charan’.
Type the select statement as shown here.
Execute the query.
Next we will learn about the delete statement.
The syntax for delete statement is as follows:
WHERE clause is used in the delete statement to delete specific rows which satisfy a particular condition.
All records will be deleted if no conditions are specified.
Let us see an example of the delete statement.
Switch to the SQL Editor window.
Let us execute the query.
If you want to remove all the rows from the students table, type delete from students.
There is no Where condition is specified here.
Next let us see an example where we have two conditions in the DELETE statement.
This delete statement will delete the student details which satisfies two different conditions.
Let us execute this query.
In the output, we can see ‘0 rows affected’.
That means there are no records in the student table which satisfies both the conditions.
With this we have covered the basics of common SQL statements such as
These statements are otherwise called as Data Manipulation language.
It includes commands that are used to manipulate data in a database.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about the -  Update statement and  Delete statement.
As an assignment, for studentid 's013', modify the student name from 'Sharmila' to 'Sharmila Babu' in the students table.
Delete the students whose cgpa is less than 5.

The Spoken Tutorial Project team: conducts workshops and gives certificates
This will help reduce the clutter
This is tutorial is contributed by Madhuri Ganapathi and Snehalatha Kaliappan from, IIT Bombay.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating objects.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Reference Variables
Here, we are using : Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse IDE 3.7.0
To follow this tutorial, you must know how to create a simple class using Eclipse.
If not, please see the Spoken Tutorial on these topics available at Spoken hyphen Tutorial dot org.
We know that variables and methods together form the members of a class.
To access the members of a class, we need to create an object for the class.
Now, let us see what an object is.
Each object consist of state and behavior.
Recall the example of 'human being' class, we had discussed in the earlier tutorial.
Object stores its state in fields or variables.
It exposes its behavior through methods.
Now let us learn about reference variables.
We know about the 8 primitive data types in Java.
All other types refer to objects rather than primitives.
Variables that refer to objects are reference variables.
Let us go back to the Student class which we have already created in the earlier tutorial.
Now, let me remove the main method from this class.
Now, Save the file by pressing Control and S keys simultaneously.
Now, create another class named TestStudent inside the same project.
I have already created it.
In this class, I have the main method.
Now, inside the main method I will create an object of the Student class.
For that, inside the main method, type:
Student space stud1 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon.
Thus, we have created an object of the Student class.
Here, Student is the name of the class for which the object is to be created.
stud1 is a reference variable referring to one object of the Student class.
And the new keyword allocates space for the new object to be created.
Please note that stud1 is not the object of the Student class.
It only holds the reference of the new object created.
Now, let us see what stud1 contains.
So, next line, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes stud1 contains space plus stud1 and then semicolon.
Now, save and run the file TestStudent dot java.
So, here Student is the name of the class of the new object created.
The second part is the memory address of the new object created.
We can access the fields and methods of the Student class using stud1.
We will learn about these in the coming tutorials.
Now, I will create one more object of the Student class.
So, I will type: Student space stud2 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon.
Now, type: next line System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes stud2 contains space plus stud2 and then semicolon.
Now, let us save and run this file.
We can see that, here, stud1 and stud2 refer to two different objects.
That is, stud1 and stud2 are referring to two different students.
They have different roll numbers and names.
Now, we can make a change here.
Here, type: Student stud2 equal to stud1.
Now, save and run this file.
We can see that, here, both stud1 and stud2 refer to the same object.
That means, both stud1 and stud2 are referring to the same student with a roll number and name.
So, in this tutorial, we learnt about:
Reference variables,  Creating object using new operator
And  assigning references.
For self assessment,
Create another class named TestEmployee.
Create an object of the Employee class  with reference variable as emp1.
To know more about the spoken tutorial project,
More information on this mission is available at
Thus, we  have come to the end of this tutorial.
This is Arya Ratish from IIT Bombay, signing off.
Thanks for joining us.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Basic bone animation” using Synfig.
In this tutorial, we will learn to animate a character using Skeleton option in Synfig.
We will also learn to: add bones,
attach bones to body and animate the bones.
To record this tutorial, I am using   Ubuntu Linux 14.04 OS,
Now let us begin. We are in Synfig.
I will open the Synfig-character file which is saved on my machine.
This file has been provided to you in the Code Files link.  Please download and use it.
Ensure that all parts of the body are in different layers.
Now, we will learn to rig the upper part of the body with fixed joints using the Skeleton.
Before that, we need to create groups.  For e.g.- left hand should be made up of left upper arm, left lower arm and left palm.
So, we need to group these three layers and name it as L-hand.
Similarly, group the other layers.
Name the group layers as L-hand, R-hand, Head, Neck and Trunk as shown here.
Let’s save this file using Save As option.
Go to File and click on Save As.
Choose your preferred location and then type the filename as Basic hyphen bone hyphen animation.
Then click on the Save button.
Now, go to the Layers panel.
Make one more group of all these grouped layers and name it as Character.
Now, open the Character group by clicking on the triangular shape.
Right-click on the top layer of the Character layer.
Go to New layer, then Other and click on Skeleton.
We get one bone on the canvas.
Click on the Transform tool and select the green dot of the bone.
Hold and drag the mouse and move the bone to the Trunk part of the character.
Now place the bone as demonstrated.
Next, use the orange dot of the bone to adjust the length of the bone.
After this, right-click on the orange dot of the bone.
And then click on the option Create child bone.
Adjust the length of the child bone in the upper part of the Trunk as explained earlier.
In a similar manner, add and adjust the bones for neck, head and hands.
Now the Skeleton layer is placed inside the body.
Next, we will attach the bones to  each part of the body.
For that, go to the Layers panel.  Right-click on R-upper-arm layer and then on Select all child layers.
Go to the canvas.  Using Shift key, hold and drag the mouse to select all the nodes of the right upper arm.
Press Ctrl key and then select the Skeleton layer.
Right-click on any node of the bone of R-upper-arm.
Click on the option Link to bone.
Likewise, we have to attach every part of the body to its respective bone by using Link to bone.
Every part of the body needs to be attached to the Skeleton.
Only then we can animate all the parts of the body using bones.
Let us now start to animate.
Go to Layers panel and select Skeleton layer.
Turn on the animate editing mode icon.
Go to Time track panel and place the cursor on the 20
Observe the various coloured dots.
Blue dot is for rotation.
Orange dot for scaling.
And, green dot is for displacement in the Skeleton.
Let’s go to the canvas.
Select the blue dot of the bone which is placed in the lower arm part of the right hand.
Move the lower arm bone as demonstrated by moving the blue dot.
Go to the Time track panel and place the cursor on the 32
Go back to the Canvas and move the lower arm bone as demonstrated.
Again, go to the Time track panel and place the cursor on the 48
Go to the Canvas and move the lower arm bone as demonstrated.
Next, on same frame select the blue dot of the palm bone.
Then move the palm bone as demonstrated.
Once again, go to the Time track panel and place the cursor on the 63
Go back to the Canvas and move the lower arm bone as demonstrated.
We will animate L-hand in the same way.
Go to canvas and select the blue dot on the lower arm bone of the left hand.
Go to Time track panel and place the cursor on the 20
Go to the Canvas.
Drag the blue dot and move the lower arm bone of the left hand as demonstrated.
Lastly, click on Turn on animate editing mode icon.
Click on Seek to begin at the bottom of the canvas.
Play the animation by clicking the Play button.
Once again, save the file.
Let us now check the preview.
Go to File and then click on Preview.
Set the Quality as 0.5 and Frame per second as 24.
Click on the Preview button and then click on the Play button.
We can see a preview of the animation on the screen.
Let’s close the Preview window.
Now, let us render the animation.
To do that, click on File and then on Render.
Go to Render setting window.
Click on Choose and open the Save render as window.
Choose the location to save the file. I’m choosing Desktop.
Change the filename to Basic hyphen bone hyphen animation dot avi.
Click on the Target drop-down menu and select the extension as ffmpeg.
Click on the Time tab and change the End time to 70.
Lastly, click on Render.
Let us check our animation now.
Go to Desktop and select the  Basic-bone-animation. avi.
Right-click and play the animation using Firefox web browser.
With this, we have come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt about basic bone animation in Synfig.
We also learnt to add bones, attach bones to the body and animate the bones.
Open the Synfig file given to you in the Code files link.
Add bones and animate the hand.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on OpenModelica Connectors.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: create a new class,  open an existing class , connect different classes , build a model and simulate the model.
To record this tutorial, I am using OpenModelica version 1.11.0 and Ubuntu Linux OS 14.04
But, the process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS such as- Windows,  Mac OS X or  FOSSEE OS on ARM .
To practice this tutorial, you need to know about OMEdit. The Prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website.
RLC_Circuit file used in the tutorial is provided as a code file on our site.
Download the files from Code Files link.
I have already opened the OMEdit window.
Now we will discuss how to create a new model.
First we will create a new class.  So, go to the File menu and select New Modelica Class.
Create New Modelica Class window appears.
In the Name field, enter the name of the class which we want to create.
I will enter the name as Sample.
In the Specialization field, select the type of class you wish to create. I will choose Class.
A new class will be created with the given name.
We will learn more about classes in the upcoming tutorials.
Now we will save this class.
For this, right-click on Sample class and click on Save.
Choose an appropriate location to save this file.
Let's close the Sample file. Right-click on Sample and select Unload.
Click Yes in the confirmation dialog box that appears.
Now we shall learn how to open an existing class.
To open a class, go to the File menu. Then click on Open Model/Library File.
Select the desired file you wish to open.
I will choose RLC_Circuit.mo file, downloaded earlier from Code files.
Now we will learn about Connectors.
A Connector is a way for one model to exchange information with another model.
Use of Connectors:
Connectors are used in connections, communication, coupling between component and outside world.
Next, we will learn to connect classes.
For this, I will use RLC_Circuit file which we opened earlier.
RLC_Circuit is a Modelica package containing different classes.
Let’s expand the package.
Here we can see various classes,' namely- Ground, VoltageSource, Resistor , Capacitor and  Inductor
and also a connector named Pin.
We will learn more about classes and connectors in upcoming tutorials in this series.
This package also contains a circuit  class.
Double-click on the circuit file and go to the Text view.
Here we can see that the class does not contain any code.
Now go to Diagram View.
Let us place all the blocks/components in the grid area. Then we will connect them.
Click on Resistor and drag and drop it into the grid space.
We get a message: Enter Component Name.
In the Name field, enter the component name as R and click OK.
Click on Inductor, drag and drop it into the grid space and place it next to the Resistor.
Enter the component name as L and click OK.
Click on Capacitor, drag and drop it into the grid space and place it next to the Inductor.
Enter the component name as C and click OK.
Next, click on VoltageSource and drag and drop it into the grid space.
Place it above the R, L and C which are placed in series.
Enter the component name as ACVoltage.
Note that, please do not put any space in the component name field.
It will give translation error at the time of simulation. Now click OK.
Next, click on Ground and drag and drop it into the grid space.
Place it below the R, L and C components in series.
Enter the component name as G and click OK.
Now we have all the required components to construct the RLC Circuit in series.
Let's connect these components.
Hover the mouse to the left part of component.
A pop up RLC underscore Circuit dot pin p appears.
This represents positive pin.
Similarly, the right part of component shows a pop up as RLC underscore Circuit dot pin n.
This represents negative pin.
Place the cursor over the negative pin of the Resistor.
We can see a plus sign (+) when the cursor is placed over n pin.
Click on the pin.
Hold and drag it to the p pin of the Inductor.
Click on Inductor's p pin and then release the cursor.
Next, we will connect n pin of the Inductor with the p pin of the Capacitor.
Click on the n pin of the Inductor.
Hold and drag it to the p pin of the Capacitor.
Click on the p pin of the Capacitor.
Now we have connected the Resistor, Inductor and Capacitor in series.
Next step is to provide the VoltageSource.
Click on the p pin of the Resistor.
Hold and drag it to the p pin of the VoltageSource.
Similarly, we will connect the n pin of the Capacitor with the n pin of the VoltageSource.
Click on the n pin of the Capacitor.
Hold and drag it to the n pin of the VoltageSource.
Click on the n pin and release the cursor.
Next step is to Ground the circuit.
Click on the n pin of the VoltageSource.
Hold and drag it to the Ground.
Note that Ground has got only one pin which is the p pin.
Click on it and release the cursor. Now the circuit is complete.
Pause the tutorial and check that your circuit looks like mine.
Press CTRL  S to save the class.
Now we will check for the correctness of the class.
Click on Check All Models button.
Observe the Messages Browser.
It shows the number of equations and the number of variables.
Model will be ready to simulate if both of them are equal.
Click on the Simulate button. A new window appears.
This output window displays the success message.
Expand R and click on Ir to get the plot between Ir and time.
We will learn about Equations and Variables in the upcoming tutorials.
That's all for this tutorial. Let's summarize.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to:  create a new class,
Use the same classes and connector available in the RLC_Circuit package.
This is the diagram of the circuit which needs to be constructed.

Welcome to the tutorial on Introduction to Mozilla Thunderbird.
In this tutorial, we will learn about Mozilla Thunderbird and
how to download, install and launch Thunderbird.
Configure a new email account,  Download and read messages
Compose and send mail messages,  Log out of Thunderbird.
Mozilla Thunderbird is a simple email client.
It is a cross platform software which means it can run on various operating systems.
It allows you to download email messages
from your other mail accounts to your local computer.
It also lets you manage multiple email accounts.
Thunderbird also has some advanced features.
You can import all your email data like Mail folders and Address book from other mail accounts like Gmail, Yahoo and Eudora.
If you use POP3, you can
combine all POP3 accounts into a single Inbox in Thunderbird.
You can group messages by attributes such as
Date, Sender, Priority or a  Custom label.
Here we are using  Mozilla Thunderbird 13.0.1 on Ubuntu 12.04.
If you do not have Mozilla Thunderbird installed on your computer, you can install it by using Ubuntu Software Centre.
For more information on Ubuntu Software Centre, please visit this website.
You can also download and install Thunderbird from the Mozilla website.
Mozilla Thunderbird is also available for
Microsoft Windows 2000 or later versions such as MS Windows XP or MS Windows 7.
For more information about this, please visit the Mozilla website.
To use Mozilla Thunderbird, you must have at least two valid email addresses.
You must also ensure that POP3 option is enabled in the email accounts.
And, you must ensure that you are connected to the Internet.
Let’s launch Thunderbird.
First click on Dash Home which is the round button, on the top left corner of your computer desktop.
Now, type: "Thunderbird". The Thunderbird icon appears.
The Mail Account Setup dialogue-box opens.
Let’s close this by clicking on the red cross button on the top-left.
The Mozilla Thunderbird application opens.
First, let’s familiarize ourselves with the Mozilla Thunderbird interface.
The Mozilla Thunderbird interface has a Main menu with various options.
Shortcut icons are available below the Main menu on the Menu bar.
For example- there are shortcut icons for Get Mail, Write and Address Book.
Thunderbird is divided into two panels.
The left panel displays the folders in your Thunderbird account.
As we have not configured a mail account yet, this panel will not display any folders now.
The right panel consists of options for Email, Accounts, Advanced Features and so on.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we have already
created two email accounts. They are:
STUSERONE at gmail dot com, STUSERTWO at yahoo dot in.
We recommend that you use 2 of your email accounts.
I have also enabled the POP3 option in these two mail accounts.
How did I enable POP3 in Gmail?
First, login to the Gmail account.
Open a fresh browser and in the address bar, type: "www.gmail.com".
Now, enter the user name STUSERONE at gmail dot com and then the password.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Common Editing and Printing Functions in LibreOffice Draw.
Set margins for the Draw page
Insert page numbers, Date and time
Undo and Redo actions
Rename a page and
Print a page.
Here, we are using: Ubuntu Linux, version 10.04 and  LibreOffice Suite, version 3.3.4.
Let’s open the file 'WaterCycle' and select the page that has the 'WaterCycle' diagram.
Let’s set Page Margins for this drawing.
Why are Page Margins necessary?
Page Margins determine the space within which the objects will be placed inside a page.
For example, we may need to print the drawing and file it.
Margins ensure that there is adequate space on the sides
so that a part of the figure is not cut or hidden when we print it.
Let’s set Page Margins and then print the WaterCycle drawing.
Let’s say the paper size that we use to print this diagram, is not the standard size.
It has a width of 20 cms and a height of 20 cms.
It also requires a bottom margin of 1.5 cms.
To set these measurements from the Main menu, select Format and click Page.
The Page Setup dialog-box appears.
Select the Page tab.
In the Width field, enter the value “20” and in the Height field “20”.
Under Margins, in the Bottom field, enter '1.5'.
To the right, you will see a preview of the Draw page.
This preview displays the changes made to the Draw page.
How does the drawing look?
It spills out of the page!
This also means that a part of the drawing will be lost when it is printed.
You must ensure that: The drawings are always within the margins.
When you draw, no part of the drawing spills out of the margin.
Therefore, it is a good practice to set up the page margins before you begin your drawing.
Again, from the Main menu, select Format and click Page.
The Page Setup dialog-box appears.
Click on the Page tab.
Click the Format drop-down list and select "A4".
This is the original margin that we had set.
The drawing is placed within the margins.
You can also access the Page setup dialog-box from the Draw page
by right-clicking on the page and using the context  menu.
Let’s click Cancel  and exit the dialog-box.
Now, let us insert page numbers, date, time and the author’s name.
Let us select the page with the WaterCycle  diagram and insert a page number.
Go to the Main menu, select Insert and click Fields.
The list of Fields is displayed.
Fields  contain values that are automatically generated by Draw.
We simply have to insert a Field  and the value generated by Draw.
Let us click on Page number.
A text-box with the number '1' is inserted on the Draw page.
Let’s adjust the size of this text-box and make it a little smaller.
Now, let us drag the box and place it at the bottom right corner of the page.
To move the number box smoothly, select the number box and press the Shift key.
Now, let’s move it further down.
Let’s check if the next number has been inserted on page two of this Draw file.
It does not have a page number!
The page number is inserted only in the page where we inserted the field!
Now, let’s learn how to change the page number format.
From the Main  menu, click on Format and select Page.
The  Page Setup dialog-box appears.
Click on the Page  tab.
Under the Layout settings, select Format.
From the drop-down list, select a, b, c.
The page numbering has changed from 1, 2, 3 to a, b, c.
Likewise, you can change it to any format.
Let’s learn how to insert Date and Time fields.
You can also insert Date and Time  stamps on your Draw page.
You can do so by clicking on Insert  and Fields.
One is Date(fixed) and Time(fixed).
The other is Date(variable) and Time(variable).
The Date (fixed) and Time (fixed) options insert the current date and time.
These date and time values  will not be updated.
The Date (variable) and the Time (variable) options, on the other hand,
are automatically updated as and when you open the file.
Let’s insert the Time (variable) here.
Now, let us drag the box and place it above the page number at the bottom right corner of the page.
The time inserted will be updated to the current time whenever you open the Draw page.
Let us now enter the name of the author who has created this file.
Here, we shall setup the author’s name on page one as- “Teacher A. B.”
So, let’s go to Page one.
Go to the Main  menu, select Tools and click Options.
The Options dialog-box appears.
In the  Options dialog-box, click on LibreOffice and then click on  User Data.
On the right hand side of the dialog-box, you can enter the user data information.
You can enter the details here as per your requirements.
In the "First/Last Name/Initials", let’s enter the text "Teacher", 'A', and 'B' respectively.
Now, from the  Main  menu, click  Insert, select Fields and click Author.
The name Teacher A B is inserted in a text-box.
Let’s drag this box and place it just above the Time field, at the bottom right corner of the Draw page.
Now, what if we want to remove the fields we inserted, in the Draw page?
Simply select the text-box and press Delete key.
Let’s delete the field Author Name.
And what if we want to undo this action?
Simple.. you can undo any action by pressing Ctrl and 'Z' keys together.
The action that was last executed, that is, the deletion of the Author field, is undone.
The field is visible again.
We can undo or redo actions from the Main menu too.
From the Main menu, select  Edit and click Redo.
The Author’s name is no longer visible!
Let’s press the Ctrl+Z keys and undo all the field insertions we made.
You can also use short-cut keys from the key board for the undo and redo commands.
Press the Ctrl and Z keys together  to undo an action.
Press the Ctrl and Y keys together to redo an action.
Change the Author’s name and Save it.
Now, add two more arrows to the page.
Insert a page number and date on page two.
Now, undo and redo the last five actions.
Check if the Undo and Redo options undo all the actions or if some actions cannot be undone.
Let’s name this page “WaterCycleSlide”.
Select the slide in the Pages pane, right-click and select Rename Page.
The Rename Slide dialog-box appears.
In the Name field, let us enter the name "WaterCycleSlide".
Now, let’s place the cursor over this page.
Can you see the name “WaterCycleSlide” displayed here?
It is a good practice to assign a name that is relevant to the page.
Now, let’s set printing options and print the WaterCycle diagram.
In the Main menu, click File then click Print.
On the left side, you will see the page preview area.
The right side of the Print dialog-box comprises four tabs:
General, LibreOffice Draw, Page Layout, Options.
Let’s look at the options specific to LibreOffice Draw.
Click on the LibreOffice Draw tab.
Let’s check the boxes Page name and Date and Time.
This will print the page name, date and time along with the drawing.
Let us select Original colors and Fit to printable page to print the drawing.
Click on Print to print the 'WaterCycle' drawing from your computer.
If you have configured your printer correctly then your drawing should begin printing now.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on LibreOffice Draw.
Set margins for the Draw page.
And how to insert page numbers, date, and time
To Undo and Redo actions
Rename a page and Print a page.
Insert two more pages.
Set different margins for each page and print the label and the invitation that you created in the previous tutorial.
Insert the field Page count in each of these pages and observe what happens.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Build and Modify Process Diagram in CellDesigner.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: use Macros , move Components on the draw area , connect a reaction line around a species,
align and extend a reaction line , add a Product and a Reactant.
For this tutorial, I am usingUbuntu Linux OS 14.04,  CellDesigner version 4.3, Java version 1.7.
To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with: undergraduate Biochemistry, CellDesigner interface.
If not, for relevant CellDesigner tutorials, please visit the Spoken Tutorial website.
Let us begin.
What you see here is the conventional diagram for Alanine Biosynthesis.
Now, we’ll use CellDesigner to create this process diagram.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously.
Now type: ./runCellDesigner4.3 and press Enter.
CellDesigner window is now open on your terminal.
Open a new file by pressing CTRL+N and name it Build and Modify Process Diagram.
Keep the default width and height and click on the Ok button.
Now let us learn what are ‘Macros’.
Macros are frequently used Components sets that help in drawing the diagrams easily.
On the toolbar, click on the Macros icon for Catalysis and click on the draw area.
We now have a Macros-Catalysis reaction on the draw area.
Let’s learn to move all the components to another side of the draw area.
For that, click on the Edit menu and then click on 'Select All'.
Alternately, you may press Ctrl + A keys.
All the Components are now highlighted.
Now, click anywhere on the highlighted components and drag them to the desired location.
Let's proceed.
Click anywhere on the draw area to uncheck the highlighted components.
Again, on the draw area, right click on the Generic Protein S1.
Then click on the option 'Change Identity'.
In the 'class' box, change the Protein to Simple Molecule.
Type the Name as: 2-keto-isovalerate.
And then click on the ‘Apply’ button.
In the dialog box ‘The Same Species Exists’, click ‘No’.
However, if you want to reflect the change to all components of the species, click ‘Yes’. Here, I will click ‘No’.
Observe the Generic Protein S1 is now a simple molecule named 2-keto-isovalerate.
I will drag the molecule to accomodate the name.
Right-click in the center of the end-point  Generic protein-S1  which is a product.
Change identity to Simple Molecule and name it Valine.
Click on the Apply button.
You have Valine on the draw area.
Next, rename catalyst S2. Right-click on it and select Edit Protein.
In the ‘name’ field, type Aminotransferase.
Click on Update and close the dialog box.
Drag the corner of the molecule to accomodate the name.
Next, let’s change the position of the linked reaction.
Click in the center of the 'end-point species i.e. Valine and drag and drop at the desired location.
Repeat the same with Aminotransferase.
Observe that the linked reaction follows wherever the ‘end-point’ Species moves.
We will now learn how to connect a reaction line around a species.
A Reaction line can be connected to any of the 16 connection points around a Species.
I will show you how to do so.
Open a new window by pressing CTRL+N.
Name this file as Connection points.
Keep the default width and height and click on OK button.
On the draw area, draw two generic proteins and name them Protein 1 and Protein 2.
In the main menu, click on the icon for State Transition.
Then, on the draw area, hover the mouse on ‘start-point' Species, Protein 1.
Observe that all 16 connection points are highlighted in grey color.
Note that when the cursor is pointed to one of these connection points, it will change to blue color.
Let’s click on one of the connection points.
In the same manner, hover the mouse on the ‘end-point' Species i.e. Protein 2.
Again, as explained above, click on the required connection point.
A State Transition reaction line is formed between the selected connection points.
Next, we will align the Reaction line.
Click on the State transition reaction line between Protein 1 and Protein 2
Note that the 2 process nodes on the reaction line get highlighted.
If we hover the mouse on either of the 2 process nodes, a plus sign appears.
Click on one of the process nodes.
Now drag and place the pointer on the preferred connection point.
Click anywhere on the draw area to uncheck the highlighted components.
To extend or stretch the reaction line, first click on it.
Now click on either of the process nodes located on the start-point or end-point Species.
Drag the mouse to stretch the reaction line till the preferred connection point.
From here on, we will proceed with the Process diagram.
Let us come back to the Build and Modify Process Diagram window.
Let’s add a Reactant and a Product to the existing reaction.
From the toolbar, click and place 2 simple molecules on the draw area.
Name them Glutamate and 2-Oxoglutarate.
Drag and place them adjacent to the Simple molecules: 2-keto-isovalerate and Valine.
As explained earlier, let us align the components on the draw area.
From what was explained earlier, I have now completed aligning the components.
On the toolbar, click on the icon for ‘Add Product’.
Now hover the mouse on the State Transition reaction between 2-keto-isovalerate and Valine.
Click on the highlighted process node.
Next, hover the mouse on 2-Oxoglutarate.
Click on any one of the 16 highlighted process nodes.
Observe, a reaction line appears between State Transition and 2-Oxoglutarate.
Similarly, click on ‘Add Reactant’ icon.
Hover the mouse on Glutamate and click on one of the 16 highlighted process nodes.
Next, hover the mouse on the State Transition reaction and click on the process node.
Observe, a reaction line appears between State Transition and Glutamate.
We now have a complete Catalysis reaction with a Reactant and a Product.
I will align the reaction to accommodate other components in the process diagram.
From the toolbar, use the icons: State Transition , Simple Molecule,  Generic Protein and Catalysis.
This is the completed process diagram.
To view it properly, go to View on the main menu bar and click on Zoom Fit
You now see the completed Process Diagram
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt: to use Macros,
move Components on the draw area , connect a reaction line around a species,
align and extend a reaction line, add a Product and a Reactant.
For the assignment: Build a process diagram for Methionine Biosynthesis using tools in CellDesigner.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First C program.
In this tutorial, we  will learn
How to write a simple C program
How to compile it
How to execute it We will also explain some common errors and their solutions.
Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 and gcc Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
To practice this tutorial,
You should be familiar with Ubuntu Operating System and an Editor.
Some editors are vim and gedit.
I will use 'gedit' in this tutorial.
For relevant tutorials please visit our website which is as shown.
Let me tell you how to write a C program through an example.
Open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now let's open the text editor. So, at the prompt, type
“gedit” space “talk” dot “c” space “&” sign.
We use ampersand (&) to free up the prompt.
Please note that all the C files will  have  extension  “.c”(dot C).
Now Press Enter,
the text editor has opened.
Let us start to write a program.
Type double slash “//” space
“My first C program”.
Here, double slash is used to comment the line.
Comments are used to understand the flow of program.
It gives us information about the program.
The double slash is called as single line comment.
Type (hash) “#include” space opening bracket , closing bracket.
It is always a good practice to complete the brackets first, and then start writing inside it.
Now  Inside the bracket, type“stdio” “(dot).” “h” .
stdio.h is a header file.
A program must contain this header file when it uses standard input/output  functions.
type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket.
main is a special function.
It denotes that the execution of the program begins from this line.
The opening bracket and closing bracket is called as parenthesis.
Parenthesis followed by main is to tell the user that main is a function.
Here the int main function takes no arguments.
It returns a value of type integer.
We will learn about data types in another tutorial.
Now  Let us switch to the slides to know more about  main function. Let us go to the next slide.
Every program should have one main() function.
There should NOT be more than one main function.
Otherwise the compiler cannot locate the beginning of the program.
The empty pair of parentheses indicates that main has no arguments.
The concept of arguments will be discussed in detail in the upcoming tutorials.
Now let us come back to our program.
Type opening curly bracket “{”.
The opening curly bracket marks the beginning of the function main.
Then  Type  closing curly  bracket “}”.
The closing curly bracket indicates the end of the function main.
Now Inside the bracket   press Enter twice,
move the cursor one line up.
Indentation makes the code easier to read.
It also helps to locate errors faster.
So let us give three space here
And  Type “printf”  opening bracket closing bracket “()” .
printf is a standard C function to print the output on the terminal.
Here, inside the brackets, within the double quotes.
Anything within the double quotes, in the printf statement, will be printed on the terminal.
Type“Talk To a Teacher backslash n”.
Backslash n “\n” signifies newline.
As a result, after execution of the printf function, the cursor moves to the new line.
Every C statement must end with a semicolon “;”.
Hence, type it at the end of this line.
Semicolon acts as a statement terminator.
Now press Enter give three space here.
And type “return” space “0” and a semicolon.
This statement returns the integer zero.
An integer has to be returned for this function because the function type is int.
The return statement marks the end of executable statements.
We will learn more about the returned values in another tutorial.
Now click on"Save" button to save the file.
It is a good habit to save files frequently.
This will protect you from sudden power failures.
It will also be useful in case the applications were to crash.
Let  us now compile the program, come back to a  terminal.
Type “gcc” space “talk.c” space hyphen “-o” space “myoutput”,
gcc is the compiler,
talk.c is our filename .
-o myoutput says that the executable should go to the file myoutput.
Now Press Enter.
We see that the program is compiled.
By typing ls space (hypen) -lrt, we can see that myoutput is the last file to be created.
To execute the program, type (dot slash)“./myoutput” , press Enter.
Here the output is displayed as “Talk To a Teacher”.
As I said before, return is the last statement to be executed.
Thus, after the return statement nothing will be executed. Let us try it out.
come back to our program.
After the return statement, let us include one more printf statement,
give space here, type printf opening bracket, closing bracket.
Inside the bracket within the double quotes type Welcome backslash n ,  at the end type a semicolon.
Now click on   save.
Let us compile  and execute come back to our terminal.
you can recall the previously entered commands by using up arrowkey.
That is what I did now.
We see that the second  statement  welcome is  not executed.
Let us write the 'Welcome' statement above the return statement.
Click on  Save.
Let us compile and execute.
We see that the second printf statement welcome has also been executed.
Now let us see the common errors which we can come across.  Come back to our program.
Suppose here I  will miss the dot in “stdio.h”, click on Save.
Let us  compile and execute .
We see that there is a fatal error  at line no.2 in our talk.c file.
The compiler cannot find a header file with the name “stdioh”. Hence it is giving an error "no such file or directory".
And the compilation is terminated.
Let us  now fix the error come back to a  program. Reinsert the dot “.”, click on Save.
Let us compile and  execute. Yes, it is working.
I will show you another common error.
Let us switch back to the program.
Now, suppose here I will miss the semicolon  at the end of the line.
Click on  Save. Let us compile and execute.
We see that there is  an error at line no.6 in our talk.c file. that "expected ';' (semicolon) before 'printf'".
As I said before, semicolon acts as a statement terminator.
So it will search for it at the end of the line.5 and at the beginning of the  line.6.
This is line 6.
This is the last place where you can put the semicolon.
Recall that the compiler also gives the error message on line 6.
Let us try what happens if we put the semicolon here.
Click on Save .
Let us Compile and execute.
Yes, it is working.
Now come back to our program. Let us type the semicolon here at the end of this line
as it is a conventional practice to type  the semicolon at the end of the line.
Now click on Save.
Let us Compile and execute. Yes it is working.
Now let us go back to our slides.
As an Assignment
Write a program to print "Welcome to the World of C"
See what happens if  “\n” is not included in the printf statement.

Hello Friends. Welcome to the tutorial on "Getting started with lists".
What is a List?
Let us open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously
Now, type ipython3 and press Enter. We are now in the ipython prompt.
Let us define a list with a variable name mylist
Type
In Python, strings are always placed inside single or double quotes.
Now enter type within brackets mylist and press Enter.
Here type is a function which will return the datatype of the variable.
As we can see, lists can contain elements of different datatypes
In the code typed earlier, the name mylist is a variable.
In Python, a variable must either start with an alphabet or an underscore.
They cannot start with numbers and cannot be the same as Python keywords.
You will learn about keywords as we proceed.
Few examples of keywords are “for, if, else, elif, while, in, def, or, and”.
A variable name cannot have spaces or punctuation characters or any arithmetic characters.
These are some of the valid and invalid variable names.
Getting back to our lists, the list could be created as num underscore list is equal to inside square brackets '''one comma two' and press Enter
x equal to inside square brackets inside quotes a comma inside quotes b and press Enter
Let us now create an empty list with no elements.
Type myemptylist is equal to open and close square brackets and press Enter.
We can access an element of a list using its corresponding index or position.
Index value of the elements starts from 0, 1, 2 and so on.
Negative indices are used to access elements from the end. Which starts from -1, -2, and so on
The syntax to get a specific list element is
Type mylist inside square brackets zero and press Enter.
Type mylist inside square brackets one and press Enter.
Switch to the terminal for solution
Type mylist inside square brackets minus one and press Enter.
We can also create a list inside a list.
This property makes lists heterogeneous data structures.  This is the syntax for list inside a list.
Let us include a list within a list for the variable doublelist.
Type the code as shown here: Here b c d is a list in list which is represented within square brackets inside a list.
Now let us fetch some element from doublelist.
We can see the output as b c d within square brackets. This is because the index value one contains the list inside a list as its element.
Now let us try to access a specific element, say b from the list inside a list.
For this type: doublelist inside square brackets one inside square brackets zero and press Enter.
Here the 1st parameter represents the index of the list in the main list.
The second parameter represents the index value of b in the list inside the list.
What is the command to get the element 'and' in the list doublelist?
How would you get 'and' using negative indices?
How would you get element 'd' from the list doublelist?
The solution is on your screen.
We can use len function to check the number of elements/length of in the list.
Let us find the number of elements in mylist which we created earlier.
Switch to the terminal and clear the screen. Recall mylist by pressing up arrow key and press Enter.
Type len inside parentheses mylist and press Enter. We get the length of mylist as four.
We can append elements to the list using the append function.
This function will add the element to the end of the list.
The syntax is: variable dot append within parentheses element to be added.
Switch to the terminal
Type mylist dot append inside parentheses six and press Enter.
Let us check the updated mylist. Type mylist and press Enter  We can see mylist is appended with sharp and six at the end.
We can also remove elements from lists.
The other way is removing element by the value using remove function
The keyword del deletes the element at index one, i.e the second element of the list, eggs.
Again type mylist and press Enter. We can see that the element eggs has been deleted from the list.
Let us delete the element hundred from mylist list.
For this we can use the function remove. Type mylist dot remove within parentheses hundred and press Enter.
What if the elements are repeated?
To check that, let’s do a small experiment.Type  mylist dot append within parentheses within quotes spam and press Enter
Type mylist and press Enter Here is the updated mylist.
It contains the element spam twice. One is at the start and the next is at the end of the list.
Now remove the element spam by typing: mylist dot remove inside parentheses inside quotes spam and press Enter.
We can see that only the first occurrence of 'spam' has been removed.
The function remove removes the first occurrence of the element in the sequence.
Using remove function, we can also remove an element with its index value.
Let us try this with an example. Type k is equal to inside square brackets one comma two comma one comma three and press Enter
Then type k dot remove inside parentheses k inside square brackets two and press Enter Type k and press Enter  We can see the output as[2,1,3].
Since it deletes the first occurrence of what is returned by k inside square brackets two which is one.
The solution is on your screen.
We also learnt to,
Append elements to list using the function append.
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
2. Yes, list can contain all the other data types, including list.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Introduction to OMEdit.
In this tutorial, we will learn  about: OpenModelica introduction to OMEdit,
open a Class from Libraries Browser,
To record this tutorial, I am using OpenModelica version 1.9.5 and  Ubuntu Linux OS 14.04
But, the process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS such as- Windows,  Mac OS X or   FOSSEE OS on ARM.
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of differential and algebraic equations.
What is OpenModelica?   OpenModelica is  an open-source modeling and simulation environment,
object-oriented, multi-domain modeling language for complex systems
intended for both industrial and academic purposes.
Let's first look at what is OMEdit.
OMEdit stands for OpenModelica Connection Editor.
It is a new Graphical User Interface for graphical model.
It has several features to create and modify the models.
Now, let me go to the OMEdit window.
I have already installed OMEdit on my system.
To open OMEdit window, click on Dash Home.
In the search bar, type: OMEdit.
Click on the OMEdit icon that is displayed.
On clicking OMEdit icon, we see the Welcome perspective window. It shows a list of Recent Files and Latest News.
On the left side of OMEdit window, we see the Libraries Browser. Here we can see a list of libraries.
Let us expand the Modelica library.
To do this, click on the arrow head to the left of Modelica library.
Here we can see list of available libraries.
Click on the arrow head to the left of Thermal library.
Under Thermal, we find HeatTransfer library.  Expand it.
Once again, we see many different libraries displayed.
Now, let’s expand the Example library.
Here we can see different examples of Heat Transfer.
Let us open the class named TwoMasses.
Right click on TwoMasses and select Open Class.
We can also double-click on the class name to open the class.
Now we are in the Modeling Perspective window.
The class opens by default in Diagram View.
Don’t worry if the class doesn’t open in Diagram View.
On the modeling area window, we can see the Diagram View of models.
On the top of the modeling area, we see four different icons.
The first icon represents Icon View.
Click on it to see the Model representation.
The next icon represents Diagram view.
Click on it to see the diagram that represents the model.
The third icon is Text View icon.
Here, we see the Modelica code pertaining to Two Masses class.
In upcoming tutorials, we will learn how to write code in OMEdit.
Click on the next icon which is Documentation view.
A new window named Documentation Browser opens on the right side of OMEdit window.
Here we can read the given detailed information about the model.
Now close the Documentation Browser.
Before simulating a model, we need to check for correctness of the model.
To do this, first locate Check All Models button on the toolbar.
This button has white coloured double ticks on it. Click on it.
Observe that a Messages Browser opens at the bottom of the window.
This will show messages pertaining to the Modelica class.
Now, let’s try to simulate the model.
To do this, click on green colored arrow button on the toolbar.
This is the Simulate button which is used to simulate the model.
We can also press Ctrl +B to simulate a Modelica class.
On simulating, a new window opens.
It shows the compilation process of the class.
Once the compilation is successful, the output window displays the message:
Simulation process finished successfully. Minimize this window.
By default, Plotting Perspective opens in the OMEdit window.
If it does not open, click the Plotting button at the bottom right.
We can also press Ctrl +F3 to open Plotting window.
Here we can see the simulation results of the Modelica class.
On the right of Plotting Perspective, look at the Variables Browser window.
Under Variables Browser, I will demonstrate how to change input variable values of a Modelica class.
Let’s expand the conduction variable.
Change the value of G and see how the values of Q_flow and dT change.
By default, G = 10, Q_flow = 263.599 W and dT = 26.3599 K.
Let us change the value of G, from 10 to 15
Go to the top right corner of the window.
Click Re-simulate button on the toolbar.
We get the success message window. Minimize this window.
Once simulation is completed, note the changes.
Q_flow = 203.009 W and dT = 13.5339 K.
Now, let me show you how to generate a plot.
Click on the check box against dT variable.
You can see a plot between time on X-axis and dT on Y-axis.
This plot describes the temperature difference between two masses varying with time.
By default, the simulation runs from 0 to 1 unit time.
We can vary this interval using the Simulation Setup option.
For this, go to Modeling Perspective.
Click on Modeling button at the bottom right.
Or press Ctrl +F2 to open Modeling window.
Click on Simulation Setup option on the toolbar.
Simulation Setup window opens.
Change Stop Time to 5 unit.
Ensure that Simulate check-box is checked.
Click Ok.
Immediately, we get the success message window.
Minimize this window.
The class is re-simulated with a simulation interval of 0 to 5 unit time.
We can also obtain a plot between any two variables, other than time. Let’s try that now.
Click on New Parametric Plot Window on the toolbar.
Let's select the two variables Q_flow and dT that we wish to plot.
We can now see a plot between dT on X-axis and Q_flow on Y-axis.
It shows the variation of heat flow as the temperature difference between them decreases.
Once the necessary plot is generated, we can delete the results.
In the Variables Browser, right click on TwoMasses.
Select Delete Result. The result has now been deleted.
OpenModelica has a Help menu.
Go to the Menu bar and click on Help option.
Here we can see User Guide, System, Scripting and Modelica Documentation.

The spoken tutorial project team conducts workshops and gives certificates on passing online tests.
This tutorial is contributed by Prajwal.M from NIT Surathkal and Snehalatha from IIT Bombay.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Impress - Creating a presentation document and basic formatting.
In this tutorial, we will learn about-The parts of the Impress window and
Here we are using GNU Linux as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
Let's open our presentation “Sample Impress” that we created in the previous tutorial.
Let's take a tour of what is on the screen.
In the centre, we see the workspace which is our working area.
As you can see, the “Workspace” has 5 tabs called the View buttons.
Currently the Normal tab is selected.
The Outline view shows topic titles, bulleted and numbered lists for each slide in outline format.
The Notes view lets you add notes to each slide that are not seen when the presentation is shown.
The Handout view allows to print the slides for a handout.
Here, we can choose the number of slides that we want to print per page.
The Slide Sorter view shows thumbnails of the slides.
Let's click on the Normal view button again.
On the left hand side of the screen, you see the “Slides” pane. It contains thumbnails of the slides in the presentation.
On the right hand side, you see the “Tasks” pane which has 5 sections.
The Layouts section has pre-packaged layouts.
We can use these directly or modify them as per our requirements.
We should see each of these sections in detail as we progress through the tutorial series.
Now, let's learn how to insert a slide. Select the second slide, in the “Slides” pane, by clicking on it.
Now we click on Insert and Slide.
We see that a new blank slide has been inserted after the second slide.
To add a title to the slide, click on the text bar that says Click to add Title.
Now, type: "Short Term Strategy" and click outside the text-box.
So, a title can be added in this way.
Let’s look at the first way- Click on Insert and Duplicate Slide.
We can see that a new duplicate slide has been inserted after the one we created in the previous step.
Alternately, go to the slide sorter view by clicking on the Slide Sorter tab in the “Workspace” pane.
Now, copy the 7th slide by right-clicking on it and selecting Copy from the context menu.
Right-click on the last slide and select Paste.
Select After and click OK.
You have now created a copy of the slide at the end of the presentation!
Now, let’s look at fonts and some of the ways that you can format fonts.
Select the slide titled Long term goal by double-clicking on it.
Click on the Body text-box and select all the text. Now delete it.
Now, type the following: "Reduce cost, Reduce dependence on few vendors, Develop customized applications".
Changing the font type and font size are the same as in LibreOffice Writer documents.
Select a line of text. In the Text Format tool bar, change the Font type from “Albany” to “Arial Black”
and the font-size from “32” to “40”.
Click anywhere outside the text-box.
Notice that the font has changed.
We can  also change the font by clicking on Format in the main menu and the Character option.
This opens up a dialog-box in which we can set the Font, Style and Size as per our requirement.
Let's close this dialog-box.
To change the color of the font, we will choose the slide titled "Development up to present".
Click on the body text box and select all the text.
Click on the downward-arrow next to the font color icon and select the colour you want.
Click anywhere outside the text-box.
Notice the change in the colour.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Table and table properties.
In this tutorial we will learn how to:
Insert a table in a Writer document
Add and modify rows and columns
And adjust the table properties as per our preference.
Two files have been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Make a copy and then use them for practising.
Open the Resume.odt file which we have created earlier.
Now let’s learn how to insert Tables in a Writer document.
Place the cursor at the end of EDUCATION DETAILS and press Enter.
To insert a table into a document, click on the Insert table icon in the Standard toolbar.
Now, select the size of the table, that is the rows and columns you require.
I will select the 2X4 (2 by 4) option which will give me 4 rows and 2 columns.
Let me show you another way to insert a table into a Writer document.
Before that we will press the Ctrl + Z keys to undo the changes.
Now, click on the Table menu in the menu bar and then click on Insert table option.
Insert Table dialog-box opens with several fields.
In the Name field, let us name the table as Resumetable.
We will keep the number of Columns as 2.
In the Rows field, click on the Plus button and increase the number of rows.
Click the Minus button to decrease the number.
Below we see a list of Styles.
We can use this list to select a style for the table, if we want to.
We’ll click on the Default Style option for now.
Then click on the Insert button at the bottom right.
A table with two columns and two three rows get inserted below EDUCATION DETAILS.
Now we can type any information in tabular form inside the table.
Notice a new toolbar at the bottom.
Here are shortcuts to the most common table features.
Let’s click inside the cell in column 1 and row 1 of the table.
Here we’ll type Secondary School Examination.
Now, click on the adjacent cell and type 93 %.
Likewise, we will type other educational details in the table, as shown.
To add a new row, use the Rows below icon in the table toolbar at the bottom.
When we are in the last row of a table, press the Tab key on the keyboard.
Click on row 2 column 1.
Pressing the Tab key helps to move forward from cell to cell.
Pressing Shift + Tab keys help to move backward from cell-to-cell.
In the last row, type PhD CSE in column 1 and 2015 in column 2.
Another important feature in tables is resizing rows and columns.
We can adjust the height and width of rows and columns in a table in several ways.
We can increase the column width manually by dragging the border with the cursor.
We can do the same with row height also.
Now place the cursor in column 2 of any row and click.
Then click on the Table menu in the Menu toolbar and on Size option.
Now select Minimize Column Width suboption.
The width of the column adjusts itself automatically.
It matches the width of the content of the cells in the selected column.
Next, let’s learn some cool tricks with tables.
I am going to use the Table-demo.odt file for this part of the demonstration.
Open the file Table-demo.odt which you downloaded earlier, in Writer.
Here I have a table with 2 columns and 5 rows.
To select an entire column, move the cursor to the top of a column of the table.
The cursor changes into a downward arrow.
Now click the left mouse button. The entire column is selected.
Let’s align the text to the centre by clicking on the Centre Align icon.
The entire text in this column gets centre-aligned.
Now click anywhere on the document to deselect.
Next, move the cursor towards the top left corner of the table.
The cursor changes into a downward slanting arrow.
Click the left mouse button.
Now click anywhere on the document to deselect.
Click inside any cell in the table.
This time select the entire table by clicking on the Select Table icon in the  toolbar.
Click on the Table menu in the menu bar and select Properties.
Alternatively, click on the Table Properties icon in the table toolbar.
Either ways, the Table Properties dialog box opens.
On the extreme right, notice that the Alignment is set to Automatic.
First, let’s change this to Left.
On doing so, other disabled options in the dialog box get enabled.
Let’s name this table as MyTable1 and change the Width field to 12cm.
Click on the OK button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Observe the change in the size of the columns.
Once again, click inside any cell in the table.
Click on the Table Properties icon in the table toolbar once again.
Click on the Column tab.
Under Column Width section, we can see that only 1 and 2 are enabled.
Here, let’s change the value of column 2 to 10cm
Click on the checkbox for Adjust columns proportionally.
And press the OK button at the bottom right
Observe the change in the size of the column 2.
Click on the Select Table icon in the table toolbar.
Now, click on the Optimize Size icon in the table toolbar.
This is the shortcut icon to adjust width of rows and columns.
Select Distribute Columns Evenly option.
The columns are now of the same width.
We can also increase the column width manually by dragging the border with the cursor.
We can do the same with row height also.
Next, let’s learn how to work with cells in a table.
Click inside the cell in column 2 and row 3.
Now keeping the Shift and Ctrl keys pressed, hold the cursor over the left column border.
Then with the mouse, drag the border to the left, as demonstrated here.
Next, we will learn to split and merge cells.
Click inside the cell in column 2 and row 3.
In the table toolbar, click on the Split Cells icon.
A dialog box opens with some options.
In the Split cell into field, we will say 3.
In the Direction field, we’ll choose Vertically and click on the OK button.
The cell is split into 3 equal cells.
Now, let’s select the 3 cells and click on Merge Cells icon in the table toolbar.
That’s how we split and merge cells in a table in Writer.
Once again, click inside the cell in column 2 and row 3.
We can even split the table into 2 by clicking on the Split Table icon in the table toolbar.
The dialog box that opens, shows some options.
Depending on what we choose, the table will be split accordingly.
First I will choose No heading and click on the OK button.
The table is split into 2 tables.
Once again, click inside the cell in column 2 and row 3.
Click on the Split Table icon in the table toolbar.
I will choose the Copy heading option and click on the OK button.
The table is split into 2 tables with the same column headings.
Let’s learn about some more alignment options.
Before that, drag down the bottom row border of the second table’s heading row.
Select the entire header row as shown here.
Now, look at the alignment options for the cell, in the table toolbar.
Align Top is selected, by default.
Click on Align Bottom and Centre Vertically to see how the text gets aligned within the cell.
To give a background colour to a cell, first click within a cell.
In the table toolbar, click on the Table Cell Background Color icon.
Yellow is the default highlight colour.
To open the full color palette, click on the down-arrow of the icon.
Next to Background Color icon, we see Autoformat Styles icon.

We see varioustyles' here that we can apply to our table, if we want to.
Click on the Cancel button.
In the table toolbar, we see icons for choosing different
And there are numerical formats shortcut icons, too, in the table toolbar.
Explore all these options on your own.
Save our file by pressing Ctrl + S keys.
In this tutorial, we learnt to
Add and modify rows and columns
Adjust the table properties as per our preference
As an assignment
Insert a table with 3 rows and 2 columns
Add the headings for the columns as Column One and Column Two
Add some text in all cells of the table

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on  Simulating 2D Laminar Flow in a Channel using OpenFoam.
In this tutorial, I will show you- 2D geometry of channel Meshing the Geometry Solving and Post Processing results in   Paraview and Validation using analytic result.
Note that OpenFOAM version 2.1.1 is supported on ubuntu version 12.04.
Hence forth all the tutorials will be covered using OpenFOAM  version 2.1.1 and ubuntu version 12.04.
The tutorials were recorded using the versions specified in previous slide. Subsequently the tutorials were edited to latest versions. To install latest system requirements go to Installation Sheet.
As a prerequisite for this tutorial, you should know how to create geometry using OpenFOAM.
If not, please refer to the relevant tutorials on our website.
We simulate flow in a channel to determine flow development length along the downstream. Channel flow problem description.
The boundary names and the inlet conditions are shown as in this figure.
The flow develpoment length is given by the formula L= 0.05 times Re' that is the Reynolds number and 'D' which is the channel height.
Using the formula, the length of the channel comes out to be 5 meters and height is kept as 1 meter.
The Inlet velocity is 1 meter per second. And, we are solving this for a Reynolds number ( Re ) equal to 100.
This is a steady state problem . Therefore we are using a steady state incompressible solver for this case.
This is the file structure of our case. The folder should be created in the solver type that we choose. I have already created a folder in simpleFoam folder of incompressible flow solvers.
The folder is named as  channel. Now, let me switch to the folder.
Copy 0, Constant and System folders of any other case, in the simpleFoam directory.
I have copied the file structure of the case  pitzDaily.
Paste it inside the channel folder  and make the necessary changes in the geometry, boundary faces and boundary condition.
Now, let me open the command terminal.
To do this, press Ctrl+Alt +t keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now type cd space tutorials and press Enter.
Now type cd space incompressible and press Enter.
Type cd space simpleFoam and press Enter.
Now type cd space channel and press Enter.
You will see three folders 0, Constant and system.
Now type cd space constant and press Enter.
In this, you will see the files containing properties of fluid and a folder named polymesh.
RASProperties contains Reynolds-averaged stress model.
transportProperties contains the transport model and kinematic viscosity that is (nu), in this case is set at 0.01 m²/s.
Now in terminal, type cd space polyMesh and press Enter. Now, type "ls" and press Enter.
You will see the blockMeshDict file here.
To open up the blockMeshDict file, in the terminal, type "gedit space blockMeshDict" and press Enter. Scroll down.
The geometry is in meters. So, the convertTometers is set to 1. Next, we have defined the vertices of the channel.
We have used a 100 X 100 mesh size here and cell spacing is kept as ( 1 1 1 ).
Next, we have setup the boundary conditions and their types which are inlet, outlet, top and bottom.
As this is a 2D Geometry,  front and Back are  kept as empty.
Also, this being a simple geometry,  mergePatchPair and edges are to be kept empty. Close the blockMeshDict file.
In the command terminal, type cd space ..(dot dot) and press Enter.
Again, type cd space .. (dot dot) and press Enter.
Now. in the terminal, type cd space 0 (Zero) and press Enter. Now, type "ls" and press Enter.
This contains the intial boundary conditions  and wall functions for the channel case.
It should contain various files such as epsilon, k, nut, nuTilda  which are the wall functionsand  'p' , 'R' and capital 'U' which  are initial conditions of the flow.
Calculate 'k' which is the turbulent kinetic energy from the formula given in the slide
where Ux, Uy and Uz are the velocity components in the x, y and z directions and U' ( dash ) = 0.05 times u actual.
Calculate epsilon from the formula given where epsilon is the rate of dissipation of turbulent  energy, C mu is a constant and its value is 0.09.
And 'l' is the length of the channel. Let me minimize this.
Change only the boundary names in each of the above files.
Note that the values of nut, nuTilda, R  are kept to default.
Rest of the files should contain the initial value for each of the boundary faces.
Now, in the terminal, type cd (space) ..(dot dot) and press Enter.
There are no changes to be done in the system folder.
Now we need to mesh the geometry. To do this, in the command terminal, type "blockMesh" and press Enter.
The Meshing is done. Now let me switch back to the slide.
The type of solver we are using here is SimpleFoam. It is a Steady-state solver for in-compressible and turbulent flows.
Let me minimize this. In the command terminal, type "simpleFoam" and press Enter.
Iterations running will be seen in the command terminal.
Iterations running may take some time.
The iterations will stop once the solution is converged or it reaches its end time value.
To view the results in paraView, in the terminal, type "paraFoam" and press Enter. This will open up the paraView window.
On the left hand side of the paraView window, click Apply. The geometry can be seen here.
On top of the active variable control menu, change the drop down menu from solid color to capital U.
You can see the initial state of velocity magnitude at inlet.. On top of the paraView window, click on theplay button of the VCR control.
You can see the final value of the velocity magnitude.
Also toggle on the color legend from the left hand side top of active variable control menu, click APPLY again.
Now go to Display, scroll down. You can see Rescale, click on it.
We can see that once the flow has fully developed, it attains a maximum uniform velocity at the center. Now, let me switch back to the slides.
The results obtained can be validated with the analytical solution for laminar flow in achannel which is u(max)=1.5 Uavg.
Using openFoam, we obtain a result of u(max) = 1.48 meters per second which is a good match. This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
In this tutorial, we learnt the file structure of channel, obtained solution using steady state solver. Viewed the geometry in paraview  and validation with analytic results.
As an assignment- solve the problem for Reynold's Number equal to 1500 and validate it with the analytical result.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on feedback diagram creation using Xfig.
In the spoken tutorial on block diagram creation, we created the diagram shown here.
We will refer to it as the blocks tutorial.
Please master the blocks tutorial before starting the current one.
In this tutorial, we will explain how to create block diagrams of the type shown on this page.
I shall use Xfig version 3.2, patch level 5.
We will begin with "block.fig" created in the blocks tutorial.
Let us go to Xfig.
Let us choose the File, then Open.
In the entry box, we can enter "block" and press Open. Or double-click on “block.fig”.
Using the Save as option on File, we will save this figure as "feedback".
We now have the file "feedback.fig".
Let us put the grids on by clicking on the Grids.
The scroll bar on the right can be used to move the canvas up or down.
The role of each mouse button is shown on the top right hand side.
This role depends on the activity.
To illustrate this, let me take the mouse to the vertical scroll bar.
Observe the comment next to the left button.
I cannot move the mouse to show this. It is because, the role of the buttons will change if I move the cursor away from the scroll bar.
The left-button moves the canvas up and the right-button moves it down.
Instead of clicking the left or right button, we can also click the centre button, hold and drag the canvas up or down.
In a similar way, you can move the canvas to the right or left, using the scroll bar on the top. Left, right..
I will now move the box to the centre by clicking the middle button, holding and dragging the canvas to the centre.
As I release the mouse, the box gets moved to the centre.
Let us now create the feedback diagram starting from this block.
Let us copy this box.
Click on the box and select it.
Move the mouse to the new location and click.
Let us now put some text.
Let us click the text-box, indicated by T, from the left hand side panel.
Let us choose the size of the text.
Move the mouse to the value-box and enter 16.
Click Set.
Let us click the Text Just button in the attributes panel.
Let us choose the centre alignment.
Let us click at the centre of the first box.
Sorry, I did not choose the correct position.
I will click at a different location to move the cursor away.
I will then click at the correct position.
Let us now type the text “Control” and click the mouse.
We would now want to enter some more lines with arrows.
Let us choose the POLYLINE button.
Let us select the Arrow Mode button from the attributes panel and select the second option.
Let us click the Arrow Type button and an arrow head.
Let us click at the point where we want the line to start.
Let us move the mouse to the end point of the desired line.
Let us now click there with middle mouse button.
The line is created with an arrow.
I want to place a circle.
Let us choose the circle on the left from the left hand side panel.
We will place it to the left of the first box.
Click the mouse. As I move the mouse, the circle becomes bigger.
When we get the right size, let us release the mouse button.
Oops, the circle is larger than what I wanted.
I can undo this operation, using the Edit button at the top.
We can also delete this object, using the Delete button on the left hand panel.
Let us do that now.
A skeleton with cross hairs appears.
All key points of all objects also appear.
Move the cross hairs to a key point that indicates the circle and click.
In case a wrong object is deleted, no need to panic.
You can undo it: Click the Edit button, hold, go to Undo and release the mouse.
If some objects are closely placed, you may have difficulty in choosing them.
You can solve this through the zoom feature.
Click the View button on the top left hand side, hold and choose one of the zoom options.
Let me release the mouse at Zoom to fit the canvas.
Now it is easy to discriminate between the objects.
Let me delete the circle now.
Let me unzoom.
I will move the diagram to the centre with the use of scroll buttons.
I do not like to leave the delete symbol on because I can accidentally delete something else.
I can change this by choosing any other button.
Let me choose the left circle.
Let me redraw the circle.
I want to put another line from this line.
For this, we will first put a dot on the line.
Let us click the Library, on the left hand side panel.
The Library is indicated by a stack of books.
A dialog window opens.
Next to the Library, it says "None Loaded".
Let us click and hold.
A list of available libraries appears.
Move the mouse to the 'Logic' library and release the mouse.
Let us choose the small dot by double clicking on it.
The dialog window gets closed.
We see a cross hair along with the chosen small dot.
Let us place the dot on the line by clicking.
The cursor and the small dot show up once again, suggesting that we can place it at some other location also.
We do not want to place the dot at any other place.
Let us close it by clicking the right button of the mouse.
The right button does an undo operation.
In this case, dot selection has been removed.
Let us draw a line from this dot to the circle.
Let us select the Polyline.
Notice that the previous selections of Arrow Mode and Arrow Type have been remembered.
Within a session, Xfig remembers the parameter values.
Click at the dot.
Move the mouse to the bottom and click.
Now turn the mouse to the left, until at the bottom of the circle. Click.
Move the mouse to the circle and now click the middle mouse button.
Let us draw another line, to the left of the circle, by copying.
Let us now save this figure using the File button at the top left hand corner of Xfig and choosing Save.
Let us now Export the file.
Let us click the File button once again and choose Export.
Let us choose Language and then PDF.
We get the file "feedback.pdf".
Let us open this file through the command open feedback.pdf.
We now have the block diagram that we wanted.
We have completed our objective.
We have an assignment for you.
Substitute the blocks with different objects.
Try out operations such as rotate and flip.
View the file "feedback.fig" in an editor and identify different components.
Using the Library, create entirely different block diagrams.

Hello everyone and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Assembly of the Biogas plant.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to assemble the following-
digester tank with the dome,
mixing tank and
slurry tank.
Please note that this is an activity of day-3.
Let us start.
Transfer the chicken mesh dome to the actual plant site.
Place the dome on the raised wall of the digester tank.
Once this is done, fix the main gas pipe of 1 inch diameter on the top of the dome.
To do this, hold the pipe with the external thread on the top.
Insert the pipe between the holes of the 3 chicken layer(s) and rotate slightly.
Check if it is firmly placed.
The pipe will be fixed permanently in this position when the outer wall of the dome will be plastered.
Remember: the external thread on the gas pipe will help fit the hose pipe firmly.
Notice the external thread at the top of the gas pipe.
An important thing to be done next is the following-
On the side of the dome, adjacent to where the mixing tank will be placed,
make a firm base. This base should be 4 feet and 5 inches higher than the dome for placing the mixing tank.
Next, on the side of the dome facing the base of the mixing tank, cut chicken mesh.
Use a scissor to cut the mesh and make a hole of 6 inches diameter.
Through this hole, one end of the inlet pipe will be inserted at an angle of 45 degrees.
Rest the other end of the inlet pipe at the base of the mixing tank and plaster it with cement mixture.
Bio-waste will reach the digester tank through this inlet pipe.
This is how the inlet pipe will look like from inside the dome.
Once the gas pipe is fitted, we need to plaster the dome from outside.
An interesting fact is that the dome is plastered twice and both coats of plaster have different ratio of sand and cement.
For first coat of plastering, use the following-
sand- 200 kgs,
cement- 100 kgs,
liquid waterproofing material- 150 ml, thoroughly mixed in 20 liters of water and adequate amount of water.
What you see here is the mason using the first coat of plaster on the dome.
Before entirely plastering the outer wall of the dome,  the base of the digester tank has to be plastered for the second time.
Ratio of cement mixture to be used is-
sand -90 kgs,
cement -50 kgs,
liquid waterproofing material- 100 ml, mixed in 15 litres of water and
adequate amount of water as mentioned earlier.
What you see here is the mason adding liquid waterproofing material to the cement mixture.
Remember - the thickness of the layer of the plaster should be about 3 inches only.
Next comes the attaching of the walls of the slurry tank with the dome.
Hole of  the slurry tank has to be 6 inches lower than the dome.
This will ensure free flow of slurry into the slurry tank.
Place the slanting wall(s) of the slurry tank at either sides of the entrance to the dome.
With the hook, interlock the excess chicken mesh at the base of the dome and at the edge of the slurry tank wall.
Carefully tighten the chicken mesh securely so as to join the walls to the dome.
To seal the joints, use cement mixture with adequate amount of water.
Apply this mixture carefully so that there are no gaps at all.
Please note that at this point, we have used 3 of the 7 walls for the slurry tank.
The plastered dome should now be left for 6-8 hours for curing.
Leaving the dome for curing, we will now attach the mixing tank.
As mentioned earlier, mixing tank will be placed 4 feet and 5 inches  higher than the dome  to avoid water logging.
The mixing tank is connected to the digester tank via the inlet pipe.
Before placing, check the hole at the base of the mixing tank.
The hole should be placed just in front of the inlet pipe of 6 inches diameter.
Remember - this inlet pipe of 6 inches diameter has been already inserted inside the dome at an angle of 45 degrees.
For the hole of the mixing tank and the inlet pipe to be in line with each other, do the following-
place three bricks around these two and plaster it with cement.
After plastering, leave it for curing overnight.
This is how it will look  in a functional biogas plant.
Now, plaster the entire outer dome wall for the second time and the inner wall of the dome as well.
Prepare the cement mixture as follows-
sand- 180 kgs,
cement- 100 kgs,
liquid waterproofing material 250 ml, mixed in 20 liters of water
and adequate amount of water.
Spread this mixture evenly on the outer wall of the dome
and on the inner wall of the dome as well.
Smoothen out the plaster by using the wooden trowel.
Leave the whole structure for curing for 17 days.
This brings us to the end of day-3.
On day-4, we will do the following-
Dig two rectangular pits adjacent to the side walls of the lower tank.
The dimensions would be 1 foot and 5 inches of length, 1 foot and 5 inches of width and 2 feet of height.
Dig another pit  at the front of the lower tank as shown here.
The dimensions would be- 10 inches of  length, 28 inches of width and 2 feet of height.
Lay foundation on both the adjacent sides and the front side of the lower tank using gravel, cement and sand mixture.
The gravel, sand and cement is mixed in the same proportion as mentioned previously.
Now, join the four walls of the upper slurry tank.
Plaster the edges of the walls with cement.
The wall with the hole should face the fields. This will help the slurry to flow out smoothly through the hole.
Coming back to the dome, place approximately 25 jute gunny bags on the dome.
Twice a day, start spraying water on the dome.
Spray as much is required to wet the outer wall of the dome.
Jute bags placed on the outer wall help to retain the water.
This will keep the dome wet for longer hours.
Lastly, the entire dome should be covered with the plastic sheet held between 2 - 4 pillars.
This plastic sheet will protect the dome from too much sunlight, thereby avoiding too much drying of the dome.
This brings us to the end of day-4.
On the 15th day of curing-
make a mixture of  2 litres of water,
250 gms of Synthetic Resin Adhesive and 2kgs of white cement.
Apply this mixture on the inside of the digester tank to seal crack(s), if any.
At this point, the civil work of the biogas plant is completed.
We will now learn to connect the main gas pipe to the kitchen.
Connect the main gas pipe from the digester tank to the main gas control valve, as shown here.
The joint between the main gas pipe and gas control valve should be perfectly air-tight.
Otherwise, gas leakage from this joint cannot be stopped easily.
From the main gas control valve, we have to connect a gas conveyor pipe.
Once again, connect these using a straight joint and ensure it is air-tight.
The gas conveyor pipe extends all the way to the kitchen.
Inside the kitchen, connect the safety valve to the gas conveyor pipe using a straight joint.
Connect another straight joint on the other end of the safety valve.
Make sure that all the joints are air-tight.
Lastly, connect the rubber hose to the stove.
After all the connections are made, the biogas plant is ready for use.
After 17 days of total curing time, raw materials can be put into the biogas plant.
Initial production of biogas will take about 6 days.
After that, it will be a regular daily production.
Now, to check whether biogas has been produced, do the following.
Ensure that both the safety valves are in open position for the gas to be conveyed.
Light the burner and check the flame for production of the biogas.
Another issue is water condensation. So, how can water condensation be avoided?
The gas conveyor pipe from the dome towards the kitchen should be always in an upward direction.
If so, water accumulation inside the conveyor pipe is negligible.
Let us Summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt how to assemble the following.
Digester tank with the dome
mixing tank and
the slurry tank.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Mathematical Typesetting in LaTeX.
My name is Kannan Moudgalya.
A reminder: we should call it LaTeX and not latex.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create mathematical symbols in LaTeX.
In particular, how to get into and leave from the mathematical mode. The role of spaces and creating them,
Mathematical symbols.
Finally, A M S math package and its use in creating matrices.
I am creating this tutorial on our less than 10,000 Rupee laptop.
I am using Ubuntu, TeXworks and LaTeX.
The prerequisites are the following- basic spoken tutorials on LaTeX,
exposure to the side-by-side tutorial.
All are available from our website.
I shall use the file 'maths.tex'.
It is available as a code file in our web page where you found this tutorial.
In the same location, you will find this 'pdf' file from the TeX user group, India.
We shall use it when we do assignments
Let me go to the ‘TeXworks’ window.
I have already opened the file 'maths.tex'.
Please download this file and practise along with me.
We have already seen the commands that are at the top of this file.
This command removes the paragraph indent.
We will study the effect of this statement through an assignment.
Let us start with Greek symbols that are used in mathematics.
We use dollar sign to get into mathematical mode in LaTeX.
Let us begin with alpha. We write  dollar back slash alpha dollar.
Let us compile and see that we get the Greek letter alpha in the 'pdf'.
The first dollar says that we are getting into the mathematical mode.
The second dollar says that we are leaving this mode.
From now on, I will not explicitly mention dollar or the back slash.
But you have to do exactly what you see on the screen.
Similarly we write beta, gamma and delta. Let us compile.
I did not save the 'tex' file, as TeXworks does it automatically.
Let us delete these.
We will next take up the concept of spaces in mathematical expressions.
How do we generate alpha a, that is, the product of alpha and 'a'?
Let us try 'alpha a'.
Let me compile.
'LaTeX' complains that 'alpha a' is an undefined control sequence.
It says that it does not understand this command. Let me close this.
LaTeX handles this through a space after every command.
Let us leave a space after 'alpha'.
Let us abort the compilation. Let's recompile; this has solved the problem.
As it is used to terminate a command, the space does not appear in 'pdf'.
What do we do if we WANT to introduce spaces in the output?
We have to explicitly tell LaTeX, as we do now.
Let us ask LaTeX to start a new line.
Let us write alpha backslash space a.
Compile it.
This has created a space.
If you want more space, use 'quad', as we do now.
Compile it.
You can see that 'quad' has left a large space.
We will now move to another topic.
Let us delete the last two lines. Let’s compile.
What happens to the font when we go from the text to the mathematical mode?
To understand this, let us write “Product of $\alpha and a is”.
Compile.
You can see that the font of these two 'a' s are different.
This is solved by writing this 'a' also inside dollar signs.
Let me compile.
Now the fonts of these  two 'a' s are identical.
Not keeping the font of variables identical is a common mistake.
Let’s get rid of these.
Let’s compile.
Let us now discuss a rule for creating minus signs.
Suppose that we want to create minus alpha and compile.
Let’s compile.
Notice that the minus sign appears as a small dash here.
Let us also copy with the minus sign, inside the dollar sign.
Let us compile again.
See the difference in the minus sign now. The second one is what we need, the dash is not to be used.
Not putting the minus sign within dollars is a common mistake made by beginners.
Let us delete all of these.
Next we would like to explain the 'frac' command that is used to create fractions.
'frac a b'. Let's compile.
It generates 'a' by 'b'. The command 'frac' is terminated by a space. It looks for two arguments.
The first character 'a' is taken as the first argument. It becomes the numerator.
The second character 'b' is taken as the second argument; it becomes the denominator.
Notice that the size of 'a' and 'b' gets reduced automatically.
What do we do if we have longer characters?
What if we want to create 'ab' by 'cd'? I want you to try this.
In LaTeX, the arguments longer than one character are enclosed by braces.
For example, let us put braces here.
When we compile this, we get the desired output.
All the entries within the braces are taken as a single argument.
As a result, one can enter any complicated expression within braces. Let us delete all of these.
Now we will look at subscripts and superscripts.
x underscore a creates x sub a.
The size of 'a' gets automatically reduced to an appropriate level.
What if we want to put 'ab' as the subscript? you have to use braces. Try it yourself.
Superscripts are created by the caret or the up arrow symbol.
For example, if you want to create 'x' to the power 3, you will write: x up arrow 3.
We can also put subscripts and superscripts simultaneously.
Let us put x sub a superscript b; let’s compile.
Once again, using braces, we can produce complicated subscripts and superscripts. Let me delete this.
Alright.. next we will move onto Matrices.
The package a m s math has some matrix definitions that I like.
Let us include it through the 'usepackage' command.
The ampersand, that is, the 'and' symbol is used to separate the columns.
Let us create a matrix now.
We write 'begin matrix' 'a' and 'b', 'end matrix'. Don’t forget the dollar signs.
Compile and see the matrix, as expected.
Now suppose, we want to add a second row to this, we put two back slashes, meaning, go to the next line.
Suppose that we want three entries in the second row, say, 'c, d, e'. Compile it and see the second row also included now.
Supposing we change matrix to 'pmatrix', at 'begin' and 'end'.
Compile and get this.
It is now time for you to start exploring.  Let us go to the slides now.
Let us summarise what we learnt in this tutorial-
Entering and leaving the mathematical mode Using spaces and creating them

Welcome to this tutorial on Gravity and Solar System.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate Gravity and Orbits and My Solar System, PhET simulations.
Here I am using-  Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04
Java version 1.7.0 and
Firefox Web Browser version 53.02.2
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with topics in high-school science.
Using these simulations, we will -
2. Study the effect of mass and distance on gravitational force.
3. Explain how gravity controls the motion of our solar system.
4. Identify the variables that affect the strength of gravity.
5. And, determine the gravitational force.
In our solar system, all the celestial objects revolve around the Sun.
These objects are planets, moons, comets, asteroids, meteors and meteorites.
There exists a force of attraction between the Sun and the celestial objects.
This force of attraction is gravitational force.
Let us begin the demonstration.
I have already downloaded Gravity and Orbits simulation to my Downloads folder.
To open the simulation, right click on gravity-and-orbits_en.html file.
Simulation opens in the browser.
This is the interface of Gravity and Orbits simulation.
The interface has two screens-
Let us begin our demonstration with Model screen.
Click on Model screen to open it.
On the right side of the screen you can see a box.
It has four solar system like models.
Next to models, there is a gray colored Reset button.
This button sets the solar system to its default state.
We can select Gravity, using on and off radio buttons.
Below Gravity, we have check-boxes for-
Click on all the check-boxes.
Below this box, we have another box.
Bottom of the screen, we have Fast Forward, Normal and Slow motion radio buttons to change the animation speed.
By default, Normal speed is selected.
Also, there are Rewind, Play/Pause and Step buttons,
Clear button to reset the Earth Days count,
Reset button to reset the simulation.
By default, Sun and Earth system is selected.
Now click on Play button.
Notice that  Earth revolves around the sun along a circular path.
This circular motion is due to centripetal force.
Centripetal force causes change in acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path.
This force acts towards the center.
This circular path is its orbit.
Earth changes its direction of revolution at every point on the orbit.
Notice that direction of Earth's velocity is perpendicular to Sun's gravitational pull.
Now, let us count Earth Days.
Click on Reset arrow to bring the sun and earth to its default position.
Observe the changes in the Earth Days as earth orbits the sun.
Now we will change the animation to slow, to count the days precisely.
Click on Pause to pause the simulation.
Earth takes 365 days to complete one revolution.
Next we will see what happens to earth in the absence of gravity.
Click on off radio button.
Now we will change the animation to normal.
Then click on Play button.
Observe that in the absence of Gravity, Earth files off along a straight line.
This motion is tangential to the circular path.
Click on Return Objects button.
Earth will return to its default position.
Now we will see the effect of change in mass on an orbit.
By default, the Star Mass slider is at Our Sun.
Let's drag the Star Mass slider towards 1.5.
As you drag, observe the increase in size of the star.
Next, click Gravity's on radio button and then Play button.
Observe the path of the orbit.
Earth now moves in an elliptical path.
Size of the orbit also becomes small.
Here, sun is not at the centre of the orbit.
Note that Earth Days decrease with the increase in the mass of the sun.
Drag the Planet Mass slider towards 1.5.
Notice that force of gravity between them increases.
Click on Pause button to pause the simulation.
Click on the planet and drag it away from the sun.
Click on the Play button.
Observe that gravitational force decreases with increase in the distance between planet and sun.
Click on Pause button. Click on Reset button to reset the system.
Now select Sun, Earth and Moon system.
Drag the slider towards plus sign (+) to zoom in the view.
Then click on Play button.
Notice that moon is in spiral orbit with earth while earth is in circular orbit with sun.
Here moon is a satellite of the earth.
As an assignment, using Model screen, explore earth, moon and earth, satellite systems.
Now we will move on to To Scale screen.
Click on To Scale screen at the bottom of the interface.
To Scale screen has same tools as that of Model screen.
This screen has two additional check-boxes-
Click on Mass, Path and Grid check-boxes.
By default, sun and earth system is selected.
Here, star's mass is 333 thousand Earth masses and planet's mass is 1 Earth mass.
Click on Play button to show the path of revolution.
Then click on pause button.
Let's measure the distance between star and Earth.
Check against Measuring Tape check-box.
Uncheck Mass check-box.
This will enable us to measure the distance precisely.
Drag the zoom in slider towards plus sign (+) to zoom in the view.
Place the Measuring Tape on star and drag the other end to the planet.
Note the distance between star and planet.
It is 91503 thousand miles.
This value may vary a little in your case because sun is also in motion.
Let us calculate gravitational force between Earth and sun.
Universal law of gravitation-  Force of attraction between any two objects is proportional to the product of their masses.
It is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
This force is along the line joining the centers of two objects.
Gravitational force is calculated by using following formula where G is universal gravitation constant,
capital M is mass of sun,
small m is mass of earth
and d is distance between earth and planet.
We substitute the values of G, capital M, small m and d in this formula.
This will give us the value of the Gravitational force between sun and Earth.
The value is 3.6 x10
As an assignment, using To Scale screen,  determine the gravitational force between Earth and satellite.
Now we will move on to My Solar System PhET simulation.
I have already downloaded My Solar System simulation to my Downloads folder.
Then type: java space hyphen jar space my-solar-system_en.jar and press Enter.
My Solar System simulation opens.
This is the interface of My Solar System simulation.
Screen has a system drop-down box on the right side.
Here, we can select a pair of solar systems of our choice.
Below the drop-down box there is another box.
It consists of Start, Stop and Reset buttons.
We have check-boxes for System Centered, Show Traces, Show Grid and Tape Measure.
Use these check-boxes as and when required.
There is a slider to control the speed of animation.
Screen is provided with Initial Settings at the bottom.
Here we can input the mass, position and velocity values in their respective boxes.
We can also use radio-buttons to select a number of bodies.
Now click on drop down arrow.
Scroll to Sun, planet, comet and click on it.
We see 3 coloured objects planet, sun and comet.
Red coloured arrow indicates the velocity.
It is a vector quantity indicated by V in circle.
Click on Start button and observe the orbits.   Comet moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit.
Click on Stop button.
Hover the mouse over Sun, Planet and comet to get their mass, current position and velocity.
Click on start button.
After a few revolutions the comet collides with the Sun and disappears.
Select Four star ballet and click on Start button.
Observe the orbits.  Then click on Stop button.
Hover the mouse on the bodies to get their mass, position and velocity.
As an assignment, select various systems and observe the orbits.
Change the initial settings and observe the changes in the orbits and explain the observation.
Let us Summarise.
In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to use Gravity and Orbits and My Solar System, PhET simulations,
Using this simulations, we have described the relation between Sun, Earth, Moon and Satellite,
studied the effect of mass and distance on gravitational force,
explained how gravity controls the motion of our solar system,
identified the variables that affect the strength of gravity,
and determined the gravitational force.
The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops using spoken tutorials and
This is Meenal Ghoderao from IIT Bombay.
Hello everyone, welcome to this Spoken Tutorial which is more of an update tutorial and not a full length video.
Some one has pointed out to me that in my register script, I need some kind of check to note if the user has been registered or not by the "username" that they specify.
Let us go back to our form which is here. Here you can type your 'full name'. You can choose a 'username' and a 'password'.
I have had these values here before. Let us get rid of them for now.
But, what we want is, when we are choosing the username...
for example, let's say I'm registering with the username "alex".   In the database we can see here that the username "alex" already exists.
So, what we will do is check the existence of the username.
If the username already exists, we are not going to let the user register because we don't want a double username.
If I were to register here, let me put the password in and choose the username as "alex". The username "alex" is already in the database.
Let's  change this for namesake and click Register.
I have been successfully registered.
Let us look inside our database. We can see that we have two usernames with "alex".
Now this causes problems while logging in.
The 1st occurrence of name, this one here will be logged in and this one will be ignored.
So, this person really will never be able to login into the database.
So, let's just delete this.
You need to create some kind of check to see if the 'username' already exists.
This is incredibly easy. There are more than one method for doing it.
But I am going for the simplest and probably the most effective way which is going to work.
The first thing I want to do is, take my code to connect to my database.
Selecting my database, I want to take this up to just where the 'submit' button is checked.
So, this is just connecting to the database. I am inside here.
Then, under here I can start my code to check my 'username'.
Now, you can't put your check anywhere. For simplicity, I am just going to put it here and kill the rest of the script.
If the 'username' has been found, I can put it in anywhere.
Take care when you are using a full length page in your website, the die function will cut off the rest of the code. So I don't recommend using this.
I recommend casing the checks that you already have inside the next statement and not really to kill the script.
But you will get the general idea here on how to work on what we are trying to do.
We need to just type a query that specifies taking a record with a particular username.
So, I will say "namecheck query" here. I will call the variable "$namecheck" and this will be a mysql query.
I will select "username" for simplicity. This is not going to select all the data.
So, I am selecting username from "users"
since that's our table name here.
I am going to say "WHERE username" is equal to... If we look up here, username of the person that submits the form is in the variable name "username".
So, we can just come down here and type "username" now.
Now if we choose the name "alex", this would select every record in the database that has the username "alex" and we can see there's one at the moment.
Now if I were to specify in this case, with only one record.
If I were to specify the username as "Dale", for example, no records will be returned.
So therefore, the username won't exist, if no records would be returned. So we need a function to check how many records are returned.
You can do this by creating a $count variable. It's "mysql num rows".
It just returns the amount of records or rows that are contained within your query which is called "$namecheck".
So, let's just test this. I am going to echo out $count and then kill the script.
The rest of the code does not execute.
Let's go back to Register and I'll type my full name as "alex".
Fullname, then choose an username. I am going to choose "Dale".
The password won't be checked so we could skip that.
But I will just put them here for the sake of it and click Register.
We see that we have got a value of zero that is returned.
That's because "Dale" is not actually in the database as a 'username'.
However, if I change this to "alex", that will be a small "a".
We have got some strip tags.  The way to deal with case sensitivity as well, is.... so, this is another pointer..
When we are taking the 'username' into account, what we are going to say "string  to lower" here, just to make sure that this will always convert to lowercase.
Next we are going to... let me find it.... Click Register.
We can see that the value of one is returned.
So, the check that we were looking for here is - if this variable we are echoing out, is not equal to zero,..then we need to tell the user that the username is already registered.
So, here we can create a simple if statement and our block.
Then we can say, if our '$count' doesn't equal zero, meaning there is a record present under this condition where the 'username' is already specified...
...then we can just kill the script and say "Username already taken!" or any other message. Coming back here, let's refresh.
We can choose "alex". Let me type in a password and click Register.
You can see that we have got "Username already taken!" error.
If I was to type "Dale" and choose a new name and password and click Register, we can see that it has been successfully registered into the database because the 'username' does not exists.
So, I will leave it at that. You can see that we have got our registered user in.
Add a "str to lower" function which is a really useful thing to keep everything simple.
Or you can just use a "str to lower" function in your if statement.
However, to keep it simple I would recommend that you convert all usernames into lowercase.
You need to incorporate that into a login script as well. You need to convert whatever the user is typing into the login box to lowercase.
I encourage you to play around with it.  That's a good way to find some errors.
Try them but if you do need any help, please email me.  Make sure you subscribe for updates.

Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on Using File Descriptors.
Assign an output file descriptor
Assign an input file descriptor
Close the file descriptor (fd)
with the help of some examples.
We have already studied about file descriptors in the previous tutorial.
0, 1 and 2 are the standard file descriptors for stdin, stdout and stderr.
File descriptors are used for i/o redirection.
The syntax to assign a file descriptor to an output file is:
exec [File descriptor] greater than symbol filename
Let us see an example.
I have a code file with the name fdassign dot sh.
The first line is the shebang line.
The "exec" command replaces the current shell process.
It will be executed in the place of the current shell without creating a new process.
We know that 0, 1, and 2 are standard file descriptors.
For any newly opened file, we have additional file descriptors from 3 to 9.
Here, 3 is the file descriptor.
This will write the output to the output dot txt file.
The string "Welcome to BASH learning" is sent to the file output dot txt.
This is done via file descriptor 3.
This is similar to redirecting a string to a file.
Each new string will be appended to the file.
We will append the current system date to the output dot txt file.
The syntax is: date SPACE greater-than symbol ampersand sign 3.
Here, we close the file descriptor.
After this line, the descriptor cannot write anything to the output dot txt file.
Let us execute the code and see the output.
Open the terminal using CTRL+ALT+T keys.
Type: chmod space plus x space fdassign dot sh
Type: dot slash fdassign dot sh
Let us check the output now by typing cat space output dot txt.
We can see that the string "Welcome to BASH learning" and the current system date is displayed.
Let us go back to the editor.
Now I will type echo at the end, after the descriptor is closed.
Type: echo space within double quotes Hi after quotes space greater than symbol ampersand sign 3
Let us execute the script once again and see what happens.
On the terminal, press the up-arrow key twice, recall the previous command dot slash fdassign dot sh.
"Bad file descriptor".
Let us fix this error.
Come back to the editor.
I will cut the last line of code and paste it below the date command.
Let us execute the code once again, on the terminal.
Recall the previous command dot slash fdassign.sh.
Now let us open the output dot txt file.
Type: cat space output dot txt
We can see the output.
The string "Hi" is displayed at the end.
Now we will assign the file descriptor to the input file.
Let us see an example.
I have a file named fdread dot sh.
Let us go through it.
This is the 'exec' command.
Here we will read the file output dot txt.
The line exec 3 lesser than symbol output dot txt will open the file for reading.
'cat' command will display the content of the file.
And finally, we close the file descriptor.
Now, let us execute this shell script.
On the terminal, let me clear the prompt.
Type: chmod space plus x space fdread dot sh
Type dot slash fdread dot sh
We can see the output on the terminal.
The content of output dot txt file is displayed.
Come back to the slides.
Assign the output file descriptor
Assign the input file descriptor
Close the file descriptor.
Try to append a few lines to a file test dot txt using file descriptors;
Display the contents of the file using file descriptors.
It summarizes the Spoken-Tutorial project.

The script has been contributed by FOSSEE and Spoken-Tutorial teams.
Thank you for joining.
Okay, so we have created our HTML form here and determined that the data has been processed through the POST variable when our form has been submitted.
The next thing I'll do is just check some conditions on this, just for the sake of the tutorial.
I'll say if the string length...
No, first of all I'll check for existence. So if $name and $message,
this is just saying does this exist and does this exist because as long as they do, they will always have a True value.
And we are using the "AND" operator (&&) here which says "is this true AND is this true".
If this is TRUE, we will execute the code here.
Otherwise I want to kill this script and I'll say "You must enter a name and  message".
And may be just underline that for effect.
And inside our block of the code, if this is TRUE we will perform another check.
So, here we have checked with an existence check.
And now here what we will do is run another check.
How can I word it?  I'll do a length check.  So I will comment this as length check.
We will say $name or rather the length of the string using the string-length function.
We check if this string-length function of '$name' is greater - no, lesser or equal to our 'max length' which is '20'.  We can have any number here.
And the string-length of '$message' is lesser or equal to 300 characters.  Obviously, you can have any number here, too.
Then we will execute this block of code.
Otherwise we will say "Max length for name is 20 and max length for message is 300".
Obviously a good thing to do is to store 300 and 20 in variables.
Let's set them here.  So, you can say "$namelen" equals 20 and you can say "$messagelen" equals to 300.
Then what you can do is, incorporate this here.  So "$namelen" there.... oooops so "$namelen" there
and here you could say - oh! let's put that back - and here you can say "$messagelen".
Down here too, replace these.  So, these will be dynamically replaced if you are performing the check.
So, here you say "$messagelen".
So, let's test this out. The "namelen" is maximum 20 characters. So, here we can only enter a maximum of 20 characters.  So, Alex here.
In Message, I'll enter some text, more than 300 characters long.  I'll just copy paste this along.
That should be more than 300 characters now.
So, if I click on Send me this button, we get the message - "The max length of the name is 20..."  that's the variable that's been put here.
And the maximum length for this is 300; that's another variable that's taken from here.
We are taking the check and echoing out this variable as well.
Presuming that everything is okay we are going to get the email sent to the user.
I keep stressing this,  it's the address here and we've already got our subject line here.
Perhaps we could bring these down here; there is no point setting a variable if the email is not ready to send.
So, this is our 'setup variables'. We also have the...
we could say "from" but this is similar to the email address.
So, we got the "name" already and all we really need is the "message" which again is here.
We also need some header information which I'll show you soon but I'll head straight to the "mail function".
The "mail function" is as follows - mail and the first variable you need to include is who this message is "to".  So I'll type $to.
Then the subject of the email which is just $subject.
It's here.  Then we have the body of the email, so $body.
Here we will say $body equals the following - "This is an email from $name". So we have included the '$name' inside the body of the email.
Then, just use backslash n (\n) which is new line, so that's 2 new lines.
Next, we will echo out the '$message' which will be included in this.
So, our '$body' consists of a generic message here, the user's name that we have processed in the form and then two new lines and next we have entered the '$message' that has been entered in our form here. Okay?
So, let's get rid of these.
That looks good to go.
As a 'mail function', you may think how that would work but sending email php is quite easy.
But when we do actually send the email, we can see that there are some problems.
We have got a warning - "the mail() function "send mail_from" is not set in 'php dot ini' or custom "From:" header missing".
I have not set the "send mail from" in my 'ini'. I missed that.  So I'll do it manually.
After we have done this, we'll run into another error as well.
I will teach you how to fix it but in the next part of the video.
In the next part, we'll deal with anymore errors we get after that.
So join me in the next part.  Bye for now.  This is Evan Varkey, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.
We will do through some examples.
Any of the actions can be reversed by using the exclamation mark (!) before the action.
Say, if we had to print all lines except from 3rd to 6th, we will type:sed space  -n space within single quotes 3 comma 6 (exclamation mark) !p
Press Enter.The output is displayed.
Let us switch back to our slides.
Let us see an example.
sed space -n space within single-quotes front-slash opening square-bracket [cC] closing Square-bracket omputers/p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
sed space -n space within single-quotes front-slash opening square-bracket [cC] closing square-bracket omputers/w space computer_student.txt after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
Let us view the contents.
Type: sed space -n space -e space (within single quotes) (front slash) ‘/electronics/w space electro.txt’ after the single quotes space  -e space (within single quotes) (front slash) ‘/civil/w space civil.txt’ after the single quote  space seddemo.txt
Let us switch back to our slide.
To print using sed.Line Addressing.

Welcome to this tutorial on Working directories in RStudio.
In this tutorial, you will learn about:
Working directories in Rstudio
How to read and store csv files in R
To understand this tutorial, you should know:
R and RStudio
Basic commands of R
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04
R version 3.2.3
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
We will use the captaincy data set which we created earlier in this series.
Download this data set CaptaincyData.csv from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved this data set to the folder myProject on my Desktop.
I shall set this folder as my Working Directory.
Remember we had created two scripts, myfirstscript.R and mysecondscript.R
Both were saved in the folder myProject, on the Desktop.
R always points to a default directory on our computer
This directory is where R will look, by default, for files you ask it to load.
We will find out what our current Working Directory is.
Let us switch to RStudio.
In the Console window, type getwd parentheses and press Enter.
The current Working Directory is shown in the Console.
Note down the directory path.
Now, we will learn how to set our Working Directory.
I will set the folder myProject on my Desktop as my Working Directory.
I am maximizing the Files and Plots window of RStudio.
At the top of the Files and Plots window, click on the Files tab.
Go to the upper right corner of the same window.
Below the refresh icon, click on the button with three dots.
Go To Folder window appears.
Select the folder which you want to make as your Working Directory and click Open.
I am selecting myProject located on my Desktop.
Under Files tab, you can see that the two scripts created earlier, have been loaded.
Now, below the Files tab, click on the More button with the blue gear symbol.
From the dropdown menu, select the Set As Working Directory option.
Now this folder is set as your Working Directory.
You may verify this by looking at the Console.
Now, I am minimizing the Files and Plots window.
There is one other way to set the Working Directory also.
In the Console, type setwd.
Now, inside parentheses, type the desired folder path within double quotes.
Now, we will learn how to read and store a csv file called CaptaincyData.csv.
We shall declare a variable captaincy to store CaptaincyData.csv.
In the Console window, type captaincy space equal sign space read.csv
Now, CaptaincyData.csv inside double quotes in parentheses and press Enter.
read.csv function is used to read a file and to create a data-frame from it.
Now, we use View function to see the stored data frame.
In the Console window, type View captaincy in parentheses and press Enter.
The contents of captaincy data frame appears in the Source window.
I am maximizing the Source window to see the captaincy data set.
In this tutorial, we have learned
How to get and set a working directory
How to read and store a csv file
We now suggest an assignment.
Create a new folder on your computer and make it your Working Directory.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on PERL Overview and Installation of Perl.
In this tutorial, I'll take you through
PERL overview along with  installation steps for PERL on Ubuntu-Linux and Windows operating system.
For this tutorial:  You must be connected to the Internet.
You must have Ubuntu Linux and Windows Operating System.
For demonstration purpose, I will be using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 and Windows 7 operating system.
For Ubuntu Linux installation, you must have Synaptic Package Manager installed on your system.
You must have administrative rights.
And you must also have knowledge of using Terminal and Synaptic Package Manager in Ubuntu.
If not, please see the Linux series available on the Spoken Tutorial website.
Let me give you an overview of PERL language.
PERL is an acronym which stands for  Practical Extraction and Reporting Language.
It is a general-purpose programming language.
It was originally developed for text manipulation.
Now, it is used for web development, network programming, GUI development etc.
It is simple and very easy to understand.
It does not have complex data structures like in C or JAVA.
It is well known for pattern matching.
And most importantly, PERL is an open source language.
PERL comes pre-loaded on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS.
There is no specific procedure to be followed for installation.
Let us check the installed version of PERL on Ubuntu 12.04.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + t simultaneously on the keyboard.
Then, type perl hyphen v
You will get an output as displayed here on the terminal.
This output shows us the current installed version of PERL.
In my case, it is PERL 5.14.2 .
Let us check the default PERL packages available on Ubuntu 12.04.
Let's go to the launcher bar and click on Dash Home.
In the search bar,  type: Synaptic.
Synaptic Package Manager icon will be visible.
Click on it.
You will be prompted for your admin password for Authentication purpose.
Enter your admin password and click on Authenticate.
Immediately, Synaptic Package Manager will load the package list.
This may take some time depending on your internet and system speed.
Once loaded, type Perl in Quick Filter.
You will see a list of packages.
The green color solid-filled check-box before a perl package  indicates that it is already installed
whereas check-boxes with star marks indicate that you may need these packages as well.
These will help you to create a documentation or debug a PERL script.
Install any of the missing packages depending on your future use of PERL.
Let us now go through the steps to install  PERL  on Windows Operating System.
At the time of recording the Perl tutorials, version 5.14.2 was available in Windows.
Now, there is a new PERL version available.
I will be demonstrating the installation using the new PERL version 5.16.3 .
All the PERL commands shown in the tutorials will work perfectly on the new version as well.
Open the browser on Windows Operating System,
and in the address bar, type the URL as shown.
You will be directed to the download page of PERL.
Select the download version as per your system specifications.
In my case, It will be 32 bit version of PERL.
Save the Perl msi file on your computer, in a location of your choice.
I have already saved it on my machine.
Open the folder where you have downloaded PERL msi file and double-click on it.
Then click on Run in the pop-up window.
Click on Next in the Setup Wizard  window.
Accept the License Agreement when prompted and then click on Next.
Now, Custom Setup window will appear.
This window lists all the PERL features that get installed.
These are:  Perl
PPM utility, used to download and install Perl Modules on Windows
Documentation which provides the documentation for Perl Modules and
Examples of Perl.
Keep all these default features and click on Next.
A popup window for setting environmental variable and file extension will appear.
Keep the check-box checked, as shown here.
Click on Next and then Install.
This will start the installation of PERL.
This may take some time depending on your internet speed.
Once done, uncheck the Display release note check-box and then click on Finish.
This completes the installation of PERL on Windows.
Now let us verify the installation.
Go to Start menu and type cmd to open the command prompt.
On the command prompt, type: perl space hyphen v
You will see the installed version of PERL.
If it doesn't show the version, repeat the above installation steps once again.
Now let us execute a simple Hello Perl program.
This file has been provided to you along with this tutorial, in the "Code Files" link, below the player.
Please download and use this file.
I had saved the file in users\Amol directory on my system.
So, let's go there.

Dear Friends,  Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Composite Numerical Integration.
Develop Scilab code for different Composite Numerical Integration algorithms
Divide the integral into equal intervals
Apply the algorithm to each interval and
Calculate the composite value of the integral.
with Scilab 5.3.3 version.
Scilab and
Integration using Numerical Methods.
Numerical Integration is the
study of how the numerical value of an integral can be found.
It is used when exact mathematical integration is not available.
It approximates a definite integral from values of the integrand.
Let us study Composite Trapezoidal Rule.
This rule is the extension of trapezoidal rule.
We divide the interval a comma b  into n equal intervals.
Then h equals to b minus a divided by n is the common length of the intervals.
Then composite trapezoidal rule is given by:
The integral of the function F of x in the interval a to b is approximately equal to h multiplied by the sum of the values of the function at x zero to x n
Let us solve an example using composite trapezoidal rule.
Assume the number of intervals n is equal to ten (n=10).
Let us look at the code for Composite Trapezoidal Rule on Scilab editor
We first define the function with parameters f , a , b , n.
f refers to the function we have to solve,
a is the lower limit of the integral,
b is the upper limit of the integral and
n is the number of intervals.
linspace function is used to create ten equal intervals between zero and one.
We find the value of the integral and store it in  I one.
Click on Execute on Scilab editor and choose Save and execute  the code.
Define the example function by typing:
d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket is equal to f of x close quote comma open quote y is equal to one by open parenthesis two asterisk x plus one close parenthesis close quote close parenthesis
Press Enter . Type Trap underscore composite open parenthesis f comma zero comma one comma ten close parenthesis
Press Enter .
The answer is displayed on the console .
Next we shall study Composite Simpson's rule.
In this rule, we decompose the interval  a comma b into n is greater than 1  sub-intervals of equal length.
Apply Simpson's rule to each interval.
We get the value of the integral to be:
h by three multiplied by the sum of f zero, four into f one , two into f two to f n.
Let us solve an example using Composite Simpson's rule.
We are given a function one by one plus x cube d x in the interval one to two.
Let the number of intervals be twenty .
Let us look at the code for  Composite Simpson's rule.
We first define the function with parameters f , a , b , n.
f refers to the function we have to solve,
a  is the lower limit of the integral,
b is the upper limit of the integral and
n is the number of intervals.
We find two sets of points.
We find the value of the function with one set and multiply it with two.
With the other set, we find the value and multiply it with four.
We sum these values and multiply it with h by three and store the final value in I .
Let us execute the code.
Save and execute the file Simp underscore composite dot s c i.
Let me clear the screen first.
Define the function given in the example by typing:
d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket is equal to f of x close quote comma open quote y is equal to one divided by open parenthesis one plus x cube close parenthesis close quote close parenthesis
Press Enter .
Type Simp underscore composite open parenthesis f comma one comma two comma twenty close parenthesis
Press Enter .
The answer is displayed on the console.
Let us now look at Composite Midpoint Rule.
It integrates polynomials of degree one or less,
divides the interval a comma b into a  sub-intervalsof equal width.
Finds the midpoint of each interval indicated by x i .
We find the sum of the values of the integral at each midpoint.
Let us solve this problem using Composite Midpoint Rule.
We are given a function one minus x square d x in the interval zero to one point five.
We assume n is equal to twenty .
Let us look at the code for Composite Midpoint rule.
We first define the function with parameters f , a , b , n.
f  refers to the function we have to solve,
a  is the lower limit of the integral,
b  is the upper limit of the integral and
n  is the number of intervals.
We find the midpoint of each interval.
Find the value of integral at each midpoint and then find the sum and store it in I.
Let us now solve the example.
Save and execute the file mid underscore composite dot s c i.
Let me clear the screen.
We define the function given in the example by typing:
d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket is equal to f of x close quote comma open quote y is equal to one minus x square close quote close parenthesis
Then type mid underscore composite open parenthesis f comma zero comma one point five comma twenty close parenthesis
Press Enter . The answer is displayed on the console.
Let us summarize this tutorial.
Develop Scilab code for numerical integration

Hello everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Parsing Data.
In this tutorial, we will learn to download FASTA and GenBank files from NCBI database website.
And, Parse data files using functions in Sequence Input/Output module.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate biochemistry or bioinformatics
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64 and * Mozilla Firefox browser 35.0.
Scientific data in biology is generally stored in text files such as FASTA, GenBank, EMBL, Swiss-Prot etc.
Data files can be downloaded from the database websites.
Open the website link given below, in any web browser.
A web-page opens.
Let us download FASTA and GenBank files for human insulin gene.
In the search box, type: "human insulin", click on Search button.
The web-page shows many files for human insulin gene.
For demonstration, I will select 4 files with the name “Homo sapiens Insulin mRNA”.
I will choose files that have less than 500 base pairs.
Click on the check-box to select the file, to download.
Bring the cursor to the “Send to” option, located at the top right corner of the page.
Click on the small selection button with a down arrow, present next to the “Send to” button.
Under the heading “Choose destination”, click on File option.
You can save this file in any file format, listed under format drop-down list box.
Choose FASTA from the given options.
Then click on Create file option.
Select Open with, click on OK.
A file opens in a text editor.
The file shows 4 records, since we had selected four files to download.
The first line in each record is an identifier line.
It starts with a “greater than (>)” symbol.
This is followed by a sequence.
Save the file in your home folder as “sequence.fasta'”.
Close the text editor.
Follow the same steps as above, to download the files in GenBank format
for the same files selected earlier.
Select the file format as GenBank.
Create a file. Open with a text editor.
Notice that the sequence file in GenBank format has more features than a FASTA file.
Save the file as "sequence.gb" in your home folder. Close the text editor.
For demonstration purpose, we need a FASTA file with a single record.
For this, clear the earlier selection by again clicking on the check boxes.
Now, select the file “Human insulin gene complete cds”.
And follow the same steps shown earlier to save the file in the home folder.
Save the file as "insulin.fasta".
Biological data stored in these files can be extracted and modified using Biopython libraries.
Close the text-editor.
Extracting data from data files is called as Parsing.
Most file formats can be parsed using functions available in SeqIO module.
Most commonly used functions of SeqIO module are: parse, read, write and convert.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously.
Start Ipython by typing "ipython" at the prompt. Press Enter.
Next, import "SeqIO" module from Bio package.
At the prompt, type: from Bio import SeqIO. Press Enter.
We will start with the most important function “parse”.
For demonstration, I will use a FASTA file that has many records which we had downloaded earlier from the database.
For simple FASTA parsing, type the following at the prompt.
Here, we are using the parse function to read the contents of the sequence.fasta file.
For the output, print record id, sequence present in the record and also the length of the sequence.
Also notice that the parse function is used to read sequence data as Sequence record objects.
It is generally used with a for loop.
It can accept two arguments, the first one is the file name to read the data.
The second specifies the file format.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
The output shows the identifier line, followed by the sequence contained in the file, also the length of the sequence for all the records in the file.
Notice that the FASTA format does not specify the alphabet.
So, the output does not specifies it as a DNA sequence.
The same steps can be repeated for parsing GenBank file.
For Demonstration we will use the GenBank file which we have downloaded earlier from the database.
Press up-arrow key to get the lines of code which we had used earlier.
Change the file name to sequence.gb .
Change the file format to genbank.
The rest of the code remains same.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
Here too the output shows the record id, sequence and the length of the sequence for all the records in the file.
Notice that the GenBank format specifies the sequence as DNA sequence.
Similarly, Swiss-prot and EMBL files can be parsed using the same code as above.
If your file contains a single record then type the following lines for parsing.
Here, we will use the previously saved FASTA file with a single record, that is, insulin.fasta as an example.
Notice that we have used read function instead of parse function. Press Enter.
The output shows the contents for the file insulin.fasta.
It shows the sequence as sequence record object.
And other attributes such as GI, accession number and description.
We can also view the individual attributes of this record as follows.
At the prompt, type: record dot seq. Press Enter.
The output shows the sequence present in the file.
To view the identifiers for this record, type: record dot id. Press Enter.
The output shows the GI number and accession number etc.
You can use the function described above to parse the data files of your choice.
Now, let's summarize.
In this tutorial, we have learnt:to download FASTA and GenBank files from NCBI database website and use parse and read functions from the SeqIO module
to extract data such as record ids, description and sequences from FASTA and GenBank files.
Now, for the assignment-
Download FASTA files for nucleotide sequence of your choice from NCBI database.
Convert the file of sequences to their reverse complements.
Your completed assignment should have the following lines of code.
Use parse function to load nucleotide sequences from the FASTA file.
Next, print reverse complements using the Sequence object’s built in reverse complement method.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Getting started with Eclipse.
How to  create a project and add a class in Eclipse
How to write a java program and
How to run a java program in Eclipse.
For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, Eclipse 3.7
Eclipse installed on your system.
If not, for relevant tutorial please visit our website as shown.
Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment.
It is a tool on which one can write, debug and run java programs easily.
Now let us open Eclipse.
Press Alt F2 and in the dialog box, type eclipse and hit Enter.
We have the Workspace Launcher dialog box.
A workspace is a location where all your project related data and your eclipse related files are stored.
There is already a location which is the default location.
Using the Browse feature, a different directory can also be selected.
For now, let us proceed with the default directory.
Click OK to proceed.
And we have the Welcome to Eclipse page.
Click Workbench  which is  at the top-right corner of the page.
And here we have Eclipse IDE. Now let us add a project.
Go to File , New,  select Project.
In the list of projects, select Java Project.
Also note that, for most of our tutorials, we will be using Java Project. Click Next.
In the project name, type EclipseDemo.
Notice an option that says Use default location.
If this option is selected, all the 'EclipseDemo' project data is stored in the default workspace.
If it is unselected, using the Browse feature, a different location can also be selected.
For now, we’ll use the default location.
click Finish, located at the bottom right corner of the Wizard.
We get the Open Associated Perspective dialog box.
A perspective refers to the way items are arranged in Eclipse.
The dialog box is suggesting a perspective that is suited for Java development.
Select Remember my decision  and click Yes.
Here we have EclipseIDE with the project. Now let us add a class to the project.
Right click on the project, New and select Class.
In the class name, give DemoClass.
Notice that in Modifiers, we have two options, public and default.
For now, leave it as public.
The other options will be discussed in subsequent tutorials.
And in the list of method stubs, select the option that says, public static void main.
The other options will be discussed in subsequent tutorials.
Click Finish, located at the bottom right corner of the wizard.
And here we have the class file.
Notice that there are a lot of partitions. These are called portlets.
We have the Package Explorer portlet that behaves like a File Browser.
We have the Editor portlet in which we write the code.
And the Outline portlet which gives us hierarchy of the project.
Each portlet can also be resized.
They can also  be minimized by using the Minimize button.
They can be restored by using the Restore button.
Now let us minimize other portlets and focus on the Editor.
As we can see, there is already some code, Eclipse has generated for us.
The code generated here depends on the options we select while creating the class.
Now, let us add a print statement here.
Type: System.out.println in parenthesis in quotes  “Hello Eclipse”
Add a semicolon at the end of the statement.
Save the file by clicking  File and select Save.
Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Control  S  also.
To run this program, right click on the editor, go to Run as and select Java Application.
We see that if something is printed, the Output console shows the output.
If our code had problems, the problems would have been shown on the Problems portlet.
Here is how you write and run a Java program in Eclipse.
In this tutorial, we have learnt: how to create a project in eclipse and add a class to it, how to write java source code and how to run a java program in Eclipse.
As an assignment for this tutorial, create a project by the name Display
and add a class to the 'Display' project by the name 'Welcome'.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Flowcharts, Glue Points and Beizer curvesin LibreOffice Draw.
In this tutorial, you will learn to draw Beizer curvesand Flowcharts.
You will also learn how to connect Flowcharts using Connectors and Glue points.
Here, we are using: Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.
Let’s learn about Bezier Curves.
Bezier Curves are used mainly in computer graphics to make curves smoother.
You can use these curves to experiment with the shape and size of curves.
All curves have a start point and an end point.
The points on the curve are referred to as Nodes.
Let us go to our 'Routemap' file.
Let’s go to the Commercial Complex from Home.
To do so, we have to go right from the Parking Lot.
Remember, previously we had grouped the drawing. So, let’s ungroup it.
Now, from the Drawing toolbar, click Curve and select Curve.
On the Draw page, click on the start point of the route - this is Home.
Keep the left-mouse-button pressed and drag till the Play Ground.
You will see a straight line.
Now, move the pointer to the Commercial Complex.
The line will curve as the mouse moves.
Double-click at the end point, that is, the Commercial Complex.
We have drawn a curve!
Notice that the curve transition is smooth.
Now, let us edit the points on this curve using the Edit Points toolbar.
Click on the curve.
To enable the Edit Points toolbar, right-click on the curve and choose Edit Points.
When the blue boxes appear at the end-points of the curve, we can edit the curve.
Click on the start point of the curve.
You will see a dotted line with a control point.
You can now drag the dotted line to reduce or expand the curve, as required.
Double-click anywhere on the Draw page, once you have made a change.
You can use the Edit Points toolbar to insert, move or delete points on the curve to create a smoother curve.
Draw a Bezier curve and work with all the options
using the Edit Points toolbar.
Now, let us learn to create Flowcharts.
Let’s add 2 new pages to the file RouteMap.
Draw provides a separate option in the Drawing toolbar for Flowcharts.
This flowchart shows all the stages in the Spoken Tutorial process.
Let’s create this flowchart.
From the Drawing toolbar, click on Flowcharts.
Click on the small black triangle and select Flowchart: Process.
Place the cursor on the Draw page, hold the left-mouse-button and drag it down.
You have drawn a Process box.
A Process box represents a step or an event in the entire process.
We can insert text in flowchart objects too.
Let’s double-click on the Process box and type the text "Create the Tutorial Outline to chunk content into 10-minute scripts" inside it.
Formatting options for Flowcharts are also similar to that of other objects.
Now, let’s align the text inside the Process box.
Let us select the text.
Right-click to view the Context menu and click Text.
The Text dialog-box appears.
In the Text dialog-box, check the box "Resize shape to fit text width". Click OK.
You will see that the Process box has changed its shape to fit the text!
Now, let us undo this action by pressing the Ctrl+Z keys together.
Again, let’s select the text.
Go to the Main menu and select Format and click Text.
The  Text dialog-box appears.
Let us check the option "Word wrap text in shape". Click OK.
The text has adjusted itself to fit the shape of the Process box.
In the same manner, let us now draw another Process box beneath the first one.
Let us insert the text "Create Scripts" inside it.
Now, let's draw a Decision box and insert the text "Review Okay?" inside it.
A Decision box represents a decision that has to be made.
It directs us to the next process based on the outcome of the decision.
Let us now draw another Process box beneath the Decision box.
Let us insert the text "Record Video" inside it.
Next, we need another Decision box here with the text "Review Okay?".
Let’s copy the Decision box, we created before, and place it here.
So, select the Decision box and press the Ctrl+C keys together.
Now, press the Ctrl+V keys together.
Let’s move this box beneath the previous Process box.
Now, enter the text  "Review Okay" inside it.
Finally, let’s draw a flowchart-connector and type 'A' inside it.
A flowchart-connector connects two parts of a flowchart.
Let’s say that the first part of the flowchart is on one page
and the second part on another page.
We draw a flowchart-connector at the end of the flowchart on the first page.
Then we draw the same connector at the beginning of the second page.
Before we connect the objects, let us learn about Connector Lines and Glue Points in Draw.
Connectors are lines or arrows whose ends are attached or docked to an object.
Glue points- as the name indicates are the points that glue the connectors to the objects.
All the objects have glue points.
These are invisible;
they become visible when a connector is selected from the Drawing toolbar or when the mouse pointer is moved over an object.
Glue points are not the same as handles.
We use handles to re-size the object.
Glue points are used to glue the connector to an object.
Now, let us connect the objects in the flowchart using connectors.
Go to the Drawing toolbar and select Connector.
Click on the small black triangle to see the different types of Connectors.
Let us select the option Straight Connector ends with Arrow.
When you select the Connector, you will see cross marks on all the objects in the Draw page.
These are the glue points.
Now, let’s draw a line from the glue point of the first process box to glue point of the next process box.
We will connect all the flowchart objects, in a top-to-down manner, using connectors.
You will notice that every line automatically docks itself to the nearest glue point, wherever you place the cursor.
Now, let’s connect the Process and Decision boxes.
From the Drawing toolbar, select the option Connector Ends with Arrow.
From the Process box, let’s connect to the Decision box.
Similarly, let’s connect the Decision box with the next Process box.
You can also add text to a connector.
On the connector from the Decision box to the Process box, let us type: "No".
To select the connector, just double-click on it.
The end control-points become active
and the text cursor appears.
Let us type the text "No".
Let us do this once more for the other connector.
We have created a simple flowchart!
Let’s save our flowchart by pressing Ctrl+S keys.
You can also connect the objects using lines and arrows too.
But in that case, you should group the objects.
This is because arrows do not stay docked to objects.
How are connectors different from Lines and Arrows?
Connectors are lines or arrows
whose end-points are automatically docked
to the glue points of an object.
Lines and Arrows, on the other hand, do not dock automatically.
Create the second part of the Spoken Tutorial flowchart.
Color the process boxes.
Draw a connector with the letter 'A'.
It should be the first object in this flowchart.
It should look like this.
In this tutorial, you have learnt about:Flowcharts,  Connectors, Glue points.

Also, they automatically convert to the data type you require.
Let's try and echo out my age now.
If you don't know what concatenation is, it just means to join two things together or to join two strings together in a line.
Now, this would echo out 'concatination'.
I'll say "My name is" $name "and my age is" and put my age down.
Thanks for watching!  This is Joshua Mathew dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project. (Script contributed by Bhavini Pant).
In this tutorial, we will learn to include all the major topics we covered so far
As a prerequisite, you should have working knowledge of Perl programming.
If not, then go through the relevant Perl spoken tutorials on this website.
The sample Perl program will give the output of various weather forecast reports of a region.
weather dot pm is a module file that has a complex data-structure to hold the data required for this program.
It also contains various functions to generate the report.
weather underscore report dot pl is the Perl program which makes use of this module file to give the required output.
The same code files are available under this video on our website.
Download and unzip the files provided in the code file link.
Now, let us see our sample Perl program Weather dot pm.
The block of code in this program is under the namespace Weather.
Perl implements namespace using the package keyword.
BEGIN block is compiled and executed before the main program.
Export allows to export the functions and variables of modules to user's namespace.
At the rate EXPORT and at the rate EXPORT underscore OK are the two main variables used during export operation.
At the rate EXPORT contains list of subroutines and variables of the module.
These will be exported into the caller namespace.
At the rate EXPORT underscore OK does export of symbols on demand basis.
Here, I have used references to create complex data-structures, to hold the data required for a weather-report.
$weather_report is a hash reference. “place” and “nstate” have the scalar values.
“weekly” is hash of hash references.
Each week day has four keys -
“record underscore time” is an array reference with two index values.
I have a few subroutines to display the weather report of various options.
This function prints the header information such as header of the report, place, state and current date.
Now, let us see the next function display underscore daily underscore report.
This function prints the daily report on the screen, depending upon the weekday input.
We retrieve the parameter passed into a subroutine using the shift function.
I have used the trim() function to remove the leading and trailing spaces of the parameter value.
Here is the code for the trim() function.
Lc() function returns a lowercase version of the given input.
This is used to avoid case-sensitivity.
The week-day, passed as parameter from the main program, is assigned to a local variable dollar week underscore day.
The following print statements will print the data corresponding to a specified week day.
We are using the arrow operator to dereference a value in $weather underscore report.
When working with references, we have to understand the data type we are dereferencing.
If it is a hash, we need to pass the key in curly braces.
If it is an array, we need to use the square brackets with the index values.
return function of Perl returns a value.
This can be used to check the status of the function in the main program.
The next function is write underscore daily underscore report.
This function will print the report output to a file.
The open function with the greater than (>) symbol defines the WRITE mode.
Filename is created with the weekday name and dot txt extension.
The print statements will print the corresponding data of a specified week day, to a file.
This prints the weekly report.
I have declared a foreach loop to loop through each weekday of the hash reference.
I have used curly brackets to represent the hash reference  and the arrow operator to dereference.
I am using the “keys” in-built function to loop through the keys of the hash.
display underscore daily underscore report function will print each element of the hash.
Now, let us see  a Perl program, weather underscore report dot pl  where we will make use of this module file Weather dot pm.
Here, use strict and use warnings are compiler flags that help to avoid common programming mistakes.
use Weather semicolon. Here, Weather is a module name which I have used in this program.
We have already seen that the functions required for this program have been stored in this module.
It is not required to give the  dot pm file extension here.
In this program, I'll print different reports depending upon the given options.
The user has to enter an option to print:
If option '1' is typed, it will ask the user to enter the day of a week.
The diamond operator will read from STDIN, that is, from the keyboard.
For example, if the user enters 'monday', then it is assigned to a variable dollar dayoption, which is a local variable.
Next, we can see that we are calling two functions-
We have exported all functions in Weather dot pm with “use Weather” statement in this file.
So, no need to refer the functions within a package using the colon colon (::)package qualifier
Now let's see the next option.
If option '2' is typed, it will prompt the user to enter the day of a week.
$dayoption is passed as the input parameter to the function write underscore daily underscore report.
return value from the function is stored in the variable dollar result.
Print statement asks the user to check the text file for the output.
The filename is created with the day of the week dot txt as output file.
If option '3' is typed, it prints the weather report for the whole week.
display underscore weekly underscore report is the function name of the weekly report.
This print statement draws a horizontal line for the specified number of times.
This is just to give a good look to the report.
Lastly, if the option is 4, it will quit the program.
If any option other than the ones specified is given, the print statement says “Incorrect option”.
Here, the exit value of '0', indicates the program ran successfully.
The exit value other than '0' means an error of some kind has occurred.
Switch to the terminal and type perl weather underscore report dot pl and press Enter.
We can see four options on the screen.
Type '1 'and press Enter.
We are prompted to enter a day of the week. I'll type "monday" and press Enter.
This is the header output generated from the function display underscore header().
Now, we can see the weather report of Monday.
Now, I'll execute the program once again to demonstrate the other options.
Type 2 and press Enter.
At the prompt, we have to type any week day. I will type "Wednesday" and press Enter.
We can see a message: "Please check the file wednesday dot txt for report output".
The output has been written to this text file.  Let us open the file and check the contents.
Type: gedit wednesday dot txt and press Enter.
The output file has been created with the entered week day name, with 'txt' extension.
Now, let us check the next option.
Switch to the terminal and type: perl weather underscore report dot pl and press Enter.
Type '3' and press Enter.
This time, we can see the weekly weather report.
The hash keys and hash values are stored in a random order.
So, the displayed output is not related to the order in which they were added.
In this tutorial, we have seen a sample Perl program by covering main topics of our previous tutorials.
As an assignment,  write a similar Perl program employee underscore report.pl for displaying employee salary, designation, department, leave_balance details.
Pass Employee ID or Employee name as input.
Write the required functions in the module Employee dot pm file.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Manipulating Strings.
In this tutorial, we will learn to
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to use
First let us see about string slicing.
String slicing allows us to obtain substrings.
The syntax for the string slicing is:
Type ipython3 and press Enter. From here onwards, remember to press the Enter key after typing every command on the terminal.
Let us understand the string slicing with an example. Type, data is equal to inside double quotes python
Type, print inside brackets data inside square brackets 0 colon 3
We get the sliced substring as pyt.
Note that, we are slicing the string from the index 0 to 3.
By doing so, the string elements from index 3 are not included.
Let us create a list, week underscore name which has names of the days of the week.
Type as shown. Type, s is equal to inside double quotes saturday
We need to check if the first three characters of the given string exists in the list week underscore name.
Strings can be sliced into substrings.
To get the first three characters of the string s, type, s inside square brackets 0 colon 3
As you can see, the character at last index ie 3 is not included in the sliced output.
We will check if the substring of s is present in the list week underscore name.
Type s inside square brackets 0 colon 3 in week underscore name
We get the output as True which indicates that the substring is present in the list.
Obtain the substring excluding the first and last characters from the string s.
Switch back to terminal for the solution.
Type, s inside square brackets 1 colon -1
As we already know, the last element of the string can be accessed using the index -1.
Next let us learn to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
A palindromic string is a string that is same as its reverse.
Type, s1 is equal to inside double quotes dad
Now, we need to compare this string with its reverse.
For reversing s1, we stride the string from the first to last character.
It is done by keeping the start and stop values as empty and step as -1.
That is s1 inside square brackets colon colon -1
Now, we will check if the string s1 is a palindrome or not.
Type, s1 is double equal to s1 inside square brackets colon colon -1
The output True indicates that it is a palindrome.
If the given string has capital D in dad instead of small d, the comparison would return False.
So, we have to convert the string to all lowercase or uppercase, before comparison.
Python provides the string methods lower and upper to achieve this.
Let's try it out. Type, s2 is equal to inside double quotes capital D ad
Type s2.upper open and close parentheses We get all the characters in uppercase.
Type s2 As you can see, s2 has not changed.
It is because, method upper returns a new string. It doesn't change the original string.
Let us compare the original and reversed string in lowercase.
Check if each element in the following list is present in the list week underscore name.
Switch back to terminal for the solution.
Type as shown. It returns False for python as it is not there in the list week underscore name.
Next let us learn to use replace method.
Type, email is equal to inside double quotes info[at]fossee[dot]in
We often encounter email addresses which have @ symbol and periods replaced with text as shown.
Let us learn how to get back proper email addresses.
Now, we will first replace the [at] with the @ symbol, using the replace method.
Type as shown. You can see that the @ symbol is properly replaced now.
Replace the [dot] with '.' symbol in the given email.
Switch back to terminal for the solution.
Now the variable email underscore proper has the email in the proper form.
Next, we will look at another interesting problem.
Let us say, we have a list of email addresses in the variable email underscore list as shown.
We will obtain one long string of email addresses, separated by commas or semicolons.
We will use the string method join for joining the list items into a single string.
Type as shown. Comma followed by a space will give the string with the same formatting.
Type, print inside parentheses email underscore str You can see that all the email addresses joined into a single string.
From the email underscore str, change the separator to semicolon instead of comma.
Switch back to terminal for the solution.
Type as shown. We see that the email addresses are joined by a semicolon followed by a space.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
Use the following methods
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
2. In order to remove dots and to get substring we stride the string s.
To change the string to lowercase, we use the string method lower().

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Inspection and comparison of Git.
For this tutorial, I am using-
To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of running Linux commands on Terminal.
Let us begin with git diff command.
This command will show the changes of the current status of the files.
Now, I will show you how it works. Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open the terminal.
We will go into our Git repository mywebpage which we created earlier.
First, I will create a html file history.html and commit it for demonstration purpose.
Type: gedit space history.html space ampersand and press Enter.
I will copy and paste some code into this file, from my Writer document, which I had saved earlier.
Let us save and close the file.
Recall that we have to commit our work whenever we add or remove any file.
To add the file to the staging area, type: git space add space history.html  and press Enter.
To commit our work, type: git space commit space hyphen m space within double quotes “Added history.html” and press Enter.
Let's see the Git log by typing git space log and press Enter.
Currently, we have two commits in our repository.
Open the files mypage.html and history.html by typing gedit space mypage.html space history.html space ampersand
Here, mypage.html is the file which we created in the previous tutorial. Now, press Enter.
Let us add and delete some lines in these files.
In certain situations, we may not remember what changes we have made in our files.
Let us check the Git status by typing git space status and press Enter.
It simply shows the modified file names. But we cannot get any other details.
We want to know the actual changes that have been made to these files. Let us see how to check it.
Type: git space diff and press Enter.
This command will compare the current state of the files with the latest commit.
Here you will see the two versions of the file history.html.
a slash history.html is the version of last commit. And, it is represented by a minus sign.
b slash history.html is the version of current state. And, it is represented by a plus sign.
So, here the red color line with the minus sign is the old version.
And, the green color line with the plus sign is the new version.
These are the lines which we added in the new version.
Also, you can see the changes of the filemypage.html. Press down arrow key.
Press q key to exit.
Here, the output is displayed in colors.
If we can’t see the lines with colors, type: git space config space hyphen hyphen global space color dot ui space true and press Enter.
If you don't want to see the colors, please use false instead of true in this command.
Type: git space diff  and press Enter. Now, the output is displayed without colors.
Next, I will show you how to see the changes in a particular file.
Type: git space diff space history.html and press Enter.
Here, we can see the changes made in the file history.html only.
Let us now add our files to the staging area. Type: git space add space history.html space mypage.html and press Enter.
Let’s check the Git diff again by typing git space diff and press Enter.
This time, we don’t get any output because our files have been added to the staging area.
In such a case, we can type: git space diff space hyphen hyphen staged and press Enter.
Now, we can see the same output just like the one we got in the git diff command.
We can also use  hyphen hyphen cached  instead of hyphen hyphen staged  to get the same result.
How can we compare the current state with any previous commit?
First we will see the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
Now, say, I want to compare my current state with the Initial commit.
So, type: git space diff space, then copy and paste the commit hash of the Initial commit and press Enter.
Here, we can see the difference.
In this manner, we can compare our current state with any previous commit in our repository.
In this way, using git diff command we can see all the changes in the modified files.
It will help us to make sure what exactly we have changed before committing.
Let us freeze our work at this point.
To commit, type: git space commit space hyphen m space  within double quotes “Added colors” and press Enter.
Next, let us learn how to see the difference between two commits.
Let’s check the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline  and press Enter.
Type: git space diff space then copy and paste the commit hash of “Initial commit” space.
The difference between the two given commits can now be seen.
Next, we will compare the last revision with the second last revision.
Type: git space diff space HEAD space HEAD tilde and press Enter.
HEAD indicates the last revision which has the commit message “Added colors”.
HEAD tilde indicates the second last revision which has the commit message “Added history.html”.
The latest revision is always HEAD. The latest minus 1 revision is always HEAD tilde.
Likewise, latest minus 2 is HEAD tilde 2, latest minus 3 is HEAD tilde 3 and so on.
Let us now learn about git show command which helps to see the entire details of a commit.
Type: git space show and press Enter.
This command will show the details of latest commit in the repository.
It shows what changes have been made to the files along with the commit details.
This feature is helpful when we work collaboratively.
Now, let’s see the Git log by typing git space log space hyphen hyphen oneline and press Enter.
To see the details of the Initial commit, type: git space show space . Then copy and paste the commit hash of the Initial commit and press Enter.
Here, you can see the details of the Initial commit.
In this manner, we can see the details of any commit of our repository.
Next, let us learn how to see the entire history of a file.
To see the entire history of mypage.html, type: git space blame space mypage.html and press Enter.
Here, we can see the entire history of the file mypage.html i.e. from creation point up to current stage.
Likewise, you can see the full details of any file in your repository.
Lastly, we will see how to get help from Git.
The syntax to get help, is as follows-
For example: git help show.
Let me demonstrate this. Switch back to the terminal and type: git space help space show and press Enter.
Here, we can see the manual of show command.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt about:
As an assignment, explore the following commands:

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on More on Arrays in BASH.
Extract an element from an  array
Replace an element in an  array
Add an element to an  array and
Remove an element from an  array.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with the Linux Operating System.
For this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS and
Let us see how to extract an element from an array.
The elements in an  array can be extracted from any position.
Here, position is the index number.
Note that  index number always starts from zero.
The syntax is as follows:
ArrayName within square bracket "At" sign colon position colon Number of elements to be extracted from the position mentioned.
Let us understand with the help of an example.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Type:  gedit space array2.sh space & (ampersand sign). Press Enter.
Now type the code as shown here, in your "array2.sh" file.
This is the  Shebang line.
This "declare" command  declares an array  named Linux  with elements-
"Debian", "Redhat"
"Ubuntu" and  "Fedora".
This "echo" command will print the list of all the elements in the array.
The next "echo" command will print the extracted elements.
The command ${Linux[@]:1:2} will print two elements starting from index 'one' which is "Redhat".
Now switch to the Terminal.
First, let's make the file executable by typing chmod space plus x space array2.sh. Press Enter.
Type: dot slash array2.sh press Enter.
We get the output - "Original elements in an array Linux: Debian Redhat Ubuntu Fedora".
"The two elements starting from index one(Redhat): Redhat Ubuntu".
Let us switch back to the slides.
We will see how to replace an element in an array .
An existing element in an array can be replaced using the following syntax.
ArrayName within square brackets 'n' equals to within single quote NewWord.
Here 'n' is the index number or element number.
Linux[2]='Mandriva' .
This command will replace the third element "Ubuntu" with "Mandriva".
This echo command will display all elements of array Linux after replacement.
Come back to our Terminal.
Let's execute again.
This displays- "All elements after replacement : Debian Redhat Mandriva  Fedora" .
Now, switch to the slides.
We will see how to add an element to an array.
ArrayName equal to opening round bracket within double quotes dollar sign opening curly bracket ArrayName opening square bracket "At" sign closing square bracket closing curly bracket space within double quotes New_Word_1 space within double quotes New_Word_2 and closing round bracket.
Let us understand this with the help of one example.
Switch to the code file.
The highlighted command will append  a new element "Suse"  to the array Linux.
Then we will echo all the elements after appending "Suse".
We will execute the program again.
The output is displayed: All elements after appending Suse : Debian Redhat Mandriva Fedora and Suse.
Now, come back to our slides.
We will see how to remove an element from an array.
An element can be removed from an  array by using the following syntax -
unset space ArrayName opening square bracket index number closing square bracket.
Let us switch to the code file.
Here, we are using the unset command.
And we will remove the third element Mandriva from the array Linux.
Then we will echo all the elements again after the removal of Mandriva.
Now switch to the terminal.
We will execute the program.
Here is the list of elements after removing  Mandriva.
Debian Redhat Fedora and  Suse
In this tutorial, we learned to:
Extract an element from an array
Replace an element in an array
Add element to an array and
Remove element from an array.
As an assignment- # Declare an array names2 of length 7 and perform following operations.
Extract three elements, starting from index two.
Replace third element with Debian and display.
Append any new name at the end of array.

Hello.Welcome to the tutorial on Adding a File Chooser to a Java Application.
Create an application, Create the application form.
Add the File Chooser,
Configure the File Chooser and
run the application.
For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System, Ubuntu version 12.04
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
In this tutorial, we will learn to add a File chooser to a Java Application using the javax.swing.JFileChooser component.
As a part of this exercise, we will learn to create a small Java application that loads a '.txt' file into a Text Area.
Let us first create the Java Application:
Launch the IDE.
From the main menu, choose File and New Project.
Choose the "Java" Category and the "Java Application" Projects type.
And click Next.
In the Project Name field, let's type: "JFileChooserDemo".
Clear the Create Main Class check-box.
Here, we will create the JFrame container and add a few components to it.
Right-click on the Source Packages node.
Choose New > Other.
Choose the Swing GUI Forms categories and the JFrameForm type.
For Class Name, type: "JFileChooserDemo".
In the Package field, type: "jfilechooserdemo.resources".
In the Properties window, select the Title property
and type: "Demo Application".
Press Enter to confirm.
In the Palette, open the Swing Menus category.
Select the Menu Bar component and drag it to the top left corner of the Jframe.
Right-click the Edit item of the Menu Bar component.
Select Delete in the context menu.
Next, let us add a menu item that allows to open the FileChooser from the running application.
Make sure that the Menu Bar' is selected before you drag another Menu Item here.
In the Swing Menus category in the Palette, select a new Menu Item.
Drag it to the Menu Bar and drop it onto the File item of the Menu Bar.
Right-click jMenuItem1 in the Design view.
And choose Change Variable Name from the context menu.
Rename the item to Open and click OK.
Make sure that the jMenuItem1 is still selected in the Design view.
Press the Space bar to edit the text of the component.
Change the text to Open and press Enter to confirm.
Specify the action handler for the Open menu item.
Right-click the menu item Open and choose Events, Action, Action Performed from the context menu.
The GUI builder automatically switches to the source view.
A new event handler method  OpenActionPerformed()  is generated.
Let us switch back to the  Design  view.
Let's add a menu item to exit the  File Chooser.
In the  Palette , choose the Swing Menus category.
Select  Menu Item.
Drag it to the  Menu Bar below the Open menu item on the form.
Notice the orange highlighting that indicates where the jmenuItem1  is going to be placed.
Right-click jMenuItem1  in the  Design view.
Choose Change Variable Name from the context menu.
Rename the item to Exit  and click on OK.
Make sure that the jMenuItem1  is still selected in the Design view.
Press the Space bar  to edit the text of the component.
Change the text to  Exit  and press  Enter  to confirm.
Specify the action handler for the  Exit  menu item.
Right-click the menu-item Exit.
Choose  Events, Action, Action Performed  from the context menu.
The GUI Builder automatically switches to the Source view.
A new event handler method named  ExitActionPerformed() is generated.
The  ExitActionPerformed  node appears in the  Navigator  window above the   OpenActionPerformed()  node.
If you cannot view your  Navigator,
go to the  Window  menu in the menu bar,
choose  Navigating  and click on  Navigator.
Here, you can see the  ExitActionPerformed  node appearing above the  OpenActionPerformed  node.
To make the  Exit  menu-item work,
let us include the statement  System.exit(0);  into the  ExitActionPerformed()  method body.
Switch back to the  Design  mode.
From the  Swing Controls category of the  Palette, drag a Text Area  onto the form.
Resize the added component to make room for the text, displayed by the  File Chooser  later.
Rename the variable as "textarea".
Let us next add the actual  File Chooser.
If your  Navigator  window is not open, choose  Window, Navigating, a Navigator  to open it.
And in the  Navigator, right-click the Jframe node.
Choose  Add From Palette, Swing Windows and File Chooser  from the context menu.
You can notice in the  Navigator  that a  JFileChooser  was added to the form.
Right-click the  JFileChooser  node and rename the variable to  fileChooser.
We have now added the  File Chooser.
The next step is to configure the File Chooser  to display the title that you want.
We will also add a custom file filter and integrate the File Chooser into your application.
Click to select the  JfileChooser in the  Navigator window.
Now, let's edit its properties in the  Properties  dialog-box.
In the  Properties window, below the Palette,
change the dialogTitle to "This is my open dialog".
Press Enter  to confirm.
Now, switch to the Source mode.
Now, to integrate the  FileChooser  into your application,
I have an existing code snippet which I will copy and paste into the existing OpenActionPerformed() method.
This example reads the file contents and displays them in the Text Area.
We will now call the FileChooser's getSelectedFile()  method to determine which file the user has clicked.
I will copy this code onto my clipboard and in the Source view of the IDE, paste it inside the  OpenActionPerformed() method.
If the editor reports errors in your code, right-click anywhere in the code and select Fix Imports.
Now, let us add a custom file filter that makes the File Chooser display only '.txt' files.
Switch to the Design mode and select the fileChooser in the Navigator window.
In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button, next to the fileFilter property.
In the fileFilter dialog-box, select Custom Code from the combo-box.
Type new MyCustomFilter() in the text field
and click OK.
To make the custom code work, we will write the MyCustomFilter class.
This inner or outer class will extend the fileFilter class.
I will copy and paste this code snippet
into the source of our class, below the import statements.
This inner or outer class will extend the fileFilter class.
Right-click the JFileChooserDemo project in the Project window and select Run to start the sample project.
In the Run Project dialog-box, select the jfilechooserdemo.resources.JFileChooserDemo main class.
In the running Demo Application, choose Open in the File menu to trigger the action.
Open any text file to display its contents in the text area.
Let me select the Sample.txt file and choose Open.
The fileChooser displays the contents of the text file.
To close the application, select Exit in the File Menu.
In this tutorial, you learnt to:
Add a File chooser to a Java application and
Configure the File chooser.
As an assignment- use the same demo project we have created and add the following features:
Add a Save menu item under the menu bar.
Add keyboard short-cuts for all the menu items.
Add a code snippet to the Save action, to save the file.
I have already created a similar assignment where the file chooser displays the Save option under the File menu
and gives you the option to save the text file which you open.

Hello everybody. Welcome to this tutorial on Special Commands in KTurtle.
We assume that you have basic working knowledge of 'KTurtle'.
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website:
Click on Dash home.
In the Search bar, type: "kturtle".
Click on the KTurtle icon.
Let's first look at learn command.
learn is a special command  as it is used to create your own commands.
learn command takes input and returns output.
Let's take a look at how a new command is created.
Let me zoom the program text to have a clear view.
Let's type a code in the editor to draw a square:
repeat 4 within curly brackets
Here, the number 10 specifies the length of the side of the square.
Now, let's  learn the commands involved to draw a square, using the learn command.
We will name this set of commands, to draw a square, as square.
The command 'learn' is followed by the name of the command to be learnt. In this case, it is  "square".
Let us type the following code:
learn space square space $x.
Let's include curly brackets.
Let's replace 10 by $x.
New command that we have defined  is called square.
square takes one input argument, $x, to set the size of the square.
Note that when you run this  code, square returns no output.
The command learn is just 'learning' other command  square, to be used later.
square command can now be used like a normal command in the rest of the code.
Let me add few more lines here.
Let's type: go 200,200 square 100
Using the command square 100, Turtle draws a square of dimension 100.
Let's Run the code now.
Turtle draws a square on the canvas.
Let's  now replace 100 by 50.
Let's run again,Turtle draws another square with dimension 50.
Please note that this command can be used only within the scope of this program.
I will clear the current code from editor.
Next, we will  learn about “random” command.
random command takes input and returns output.
Syntax for the random command is: “random X,Y”
where X and Y are two inputs.
X sets minimum output and Y sets maximum output.
Output is randomly chosen number between X and Y.
Let's put the “random” command to use in the application.
I already have a code in a text-editor.
I will explain the code now.
“reset” command sets Turtle to default position.
Here, the command random 1,20 selects a  number which is equal or greater than 1 and equal or less than 20 and assigns it to the variable 'x'.
repeat command and the commands  within curly brackets draw a circle.
I will copy the code from text editor and paste it into KTurtle's editor.
When we run this code,
Turtle draws a  circle with radius  between 1 and 20  on the canvas.
Let us execute this code a few times.
You can see that a circle with a different size is generated each time.
Every time you execute this code, a circle with a different radius is drawn on the canvas.
Let us now use both  learn and random commands in an example.
I will clear the current code from the editor. Type "clear" command and Run to clean the canvas.
I already have a program in the Text-editor.
I will explain the code now.
“reset” command sets Turtle to its default position.
canvassize 300,300 sets the width and height of the canvas to 300 pixels each.
$R, $G and $B are three variables to which I am assigning random values between 0 and 255.
In the command canvascolor $R, $G and $B,
the Red-Green-Blue combination is replaced by the values assigned to the  variables 'R', 'G' and 'B' in the previous step.
The canvas color is randomly  set when this command is executed.
$red, $blue, $green are another set of variables
to which random values between 0 and 255 are assigned randomly.
pencolor  $red, $blue and $green the Red-Blue-Green combination values are replaced by the variables.
$red, $green and $blue to which random values were assigned in the previous step.
The color of the pen is also set randomly when the command is executed.
penwidth 2 sets the width of pen to 2 pixels.
Next, I have entered the code to learn to draw a circle.
Here $x represents the size of the circle.
repeat command followed by the code in curly brackets draws a circle.
The next set of commands, that is,  go command followed by circle command draw circles with the specified sizes.
For example: circle with size 5, draws a circle with size 5
at the co-ordinates specified at 'X' and 'Y' positions, in the go command.
For each circle, I have specified different positions on the canvas.
I will copy the code from text-editor and paste it into KTurtle's editor.
I will execute this code in Fullspeed.
You can execute this code at any of the speeds specified in the  Run option.
I will run this code a few times.
You can see the difference in randomly set values of pen color and canvas color.
Note the change in the color of the pen and the canvas on each execution.
You can execute the code how many ever times you want and note the changes  in the randomly set values of the pen and canvas.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about: “learn” command  and “random” command.
As an assignment for you to solve,
using  learn command- draw a
a circle at the centre of the canvas.
Using the “random” command, create various colors and
customize your geometric shapes and canvas.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on ‘Customizing Diagram Layout’.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to: change color, shape and width of a Reaction line,
add Anchor points to a Reaction line , align Components , show/hide Reaction ids.
We will also learn how to: add notes to Components , edit Protein , edit information ,
and get a bird’s eye view of the diagram.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS 14.04, CellDesigner version 4.3,  Java version 1.7.
To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with: undergraduate Biochemistry and
If not, for relevant CellDesigner tutorials, please visit the Spoken Tutorial website.
Let us begin.
The assignment for one of the previous tutorials was to build a process diagram for Methionine Biosynthesis.
I am going to use that same diagram as the example for this tutorial. And, I will demonstrate how to customize it.
Let me switch to CellDesigner interface.
What you see here is the process diagram for Methionine Biosynthesis.
Pause the tutorial here and open the Methionine Biosynthesis process diagram that you created.
If you do not have a saved file, you may open from the code file provided.
Now, let me start customizing the diagram.
Let us go back to the Cell designer interface.
To start with, I will change the width and color of a Reaction line.
To do so, I am selecting the State Transition between Homoserine and Succinyl homoserine.
Now, go to “Component” in the main menu bar.
And click on “Change color & shape” option.
Alternately, you may right-click on a Reaction line and select “Change color & shape” option.
A dialog box named “Change color & shape” appears on the screen.
For a thicker Reaction line, change the Line Width from 1.0 to a higher value.
I will change this to 3.0.
To change the color of the Reaction line, go to the Color panel.
In the Color panel, we can see a color wheel with a pointer like handle.
Click and hold the pointer and rotate to select the preferred color.
I will select a shade of blue.
Next, click anywhere inside the color triangle.
Now, click and drop the small circle at the pointer.
After all the modifications are done, click on Apply and then on Ok.
Observe that the Reaction line is now thicker and in shade of blue.
Next, we will learn how to add Anchor points on the Reaction line,
and, why Anchor points are useful to turn around the Reaction lines,
give them a proper shape and place them in the correct position on the draw area..
Let's come back to the CellDesigner interface.
Select any Reaction line.
I will select the same State Transition reaction line between Homoserine and Succinyl Homoserine.
On this line, using the cursor, choose the exact position where the Anchor point has to be placed.
Upon selection of the exact point, right-click and select Add Anchor Point.
You will see the newly added Anchor point at the exact chosen position on the Reaction line.
Let me show you how Anchor Points can help to modify a Reaction line.
Let me open a new window and name it Anchor. Click OK.
Now click on the icon for GTP/GDP
and click anywhere on the draw area.
Right-click on  Reaction line and click on  Add Anchor point.
Drag and drop the Reaction line anywhere on the draw area.
Next we will see how to align the components on the draw area.
Let us come back to the Methionine biosynthesis process diagram window.
Click anywhere on the draw area to uncheck the highlighted Reaction line.
Now, hold the Shift key and click on multiple Species on the draw area.
Go to Edit menu, scroll down, select Alignment and click on the Alignment type.
Alternately, click on the icon for Alignment on the toolbar.
Explore other Alignment options on the toolbar on your own.
Let us undo the alignment and move ahead.
While working on a Reaction, how can we show/hide Reaction ids on a process diagram?
Let’s learn that.
Go to 'View', scroll down and uncheck the 'Show Reaction Id'.
The Reaction ids on the respective reactions, on the draw area, will not be visible any more.
In case, you wish to show the Reaction Id, do the following.
Go to 'View', scroll down and click on the 'Show Reaction Id'.
The Reaction ids will appear on the respective reactions, on the draw area.
We can also add notes to all the Components (Compartment, Species or Reaction) on the draw area.
Let us learn how to do that.
Right-click on a Species on the draw area.
I will click on CoA.
Scroll down and click on the ‘Species Notes’.
A pop up menu is displayed.
A dialog box 'Species Notes' pops up.  Type the text related to the Species.
I will type the following.
Click 'OK'.
Observe that the notes information is displayed in the Notes Area.
Alternately, to add notes to a Species, click on a Species on the draw area.
I will click on Succinate.
Then, click on Edit Notes tab, located at the bottom right corner of the CellDesigner window.
A pop up window will appear.
Type the text related to the Species.
I will type and click 'OK'.
In the same manner we can edit a Protein.
To do so, right-click on a component on the draw area.
I will click on Homoserine succinyl transferase.
Scroll down and click on Edit Protein.
A dialog box named Protein appears on the screen.
Enter the name of the Protein in the name box.
I will type O-succinyltransferase in the name box.
Click on ‘Update’ and close the dialog box.
We can also add regions to a Protein.
Right-click on a Protein on the draw area.
I will right click on O-succinyltransferase.
Scroll down and click on Edit Protein.
A dialog box, Protein, appears on the screen.
Under the tab ‘residues/regions’, click on the 'Add' button.
In the dialog box - ModificationResidue/Bindingregion:
Select the ‘Type’ from the drop down menu as ‘Binding region.
Change the size and angle by moving the cursor at the required value.
For this demo, I will select Size as 15 andAngle 38.
Then click on ‘Close’.
Click on the Update
and close the box.
As we do not require to add region in the Methionine Biosynthesis, I will undo these changes.
Next, let us learn to edit information.
Right-click on the component, on the draw area.
I will click on Homoserine.
Scroll down and click on ‘Edit Information’.
A dialog box ‘Edit Information’ appears on screen.
In the dialog box, do the following-   under the tab ‘state’, select Open,
under the tab ‘prefix’, select mt.
under the tab ‘label’, select dna.
Click on ‘Ok’.
You can see the information mt:dna displayed on the draw area.
I will undo Edit Information, as we do not require it in Methionine Biosynthesis.
In some cases, the process diagram can be a complicated one.
In such cases, Bird's eye view can help as it is convenient to navigate inside a big model.
Click the Bird's eye view icon.
Drag the red square in the Bird’s Eye View.
Observe that the view on the draw area moves accordingly.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt how to: change- color, shape and width of a Reaction line,
add Anchor points to a Reaction line , align Components  and show/hide Reaction id’s.
We have also learnt how to- add notes to Components,
edit Protein/Gene, edit Information,
and get the Bird’s Eye View of the diagram.

Next option is General feedback. The text here is shown to the student after he/she has submitted the quiz.
This can be used to show the detailed solution of the question, also.
Now, click on the One or multiple answers dropdown.
Here we see 2 options- Multiple answers allowed
I’ll show you how both options work.
Let me first choose One answer only.
The Shuffle the choices checkbox is checked, by default.
Scroll down to see the Answers section.
Notice that every option here is associated with a grade and feedback.
Type Choice 1 as shown here.
Now for this question, Choice 1 is the correct answer.
Therefore I will select 100% in the Grade.
In the Grade dropdown, we can also allot partial marks or negative marks to every choice.
You can explore these later when you are more proficient with Moodle.
Feedback for students who choose this answer, can be written in the Feedback text area.
Fill the rest of the choices and grades, as I have done here.
Now scroll down and click on Multiple Tries section to expand it.
Notice here - the Penalty for each incorrect try field is set by default, to 33.33%
This means a student will be penalised for every wrong answer.
You can leave it as it is or change it to any of the other percentage options shown here.
I will select 0%, as I don’t wish to penalise my students for wrong answers.
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button at the bottom of the page.
We can see that our question has been added to the Question Bank.
Notice that there are 4 icons next to the question title of the question.
These are to edit, duplicate, preview and delete the question.
Click on Preview icon to see how the question will appear in the quiz.
The selected question and its options opens in a pop-up window.
Click on Fill in correct responses button.
Click on Submit and finish button.
This will show the feedback that the student will see, after answering the question.
Whenever you add a new question, always preview it to cross check.
Click on Close preview button to close this pop-up window.
Let us now create an MCQ which has more than one correct answer.
Following the previous steps, I have created another MCQ.
In One or multiple answers dropdown, this time I will select Multiple answers allowed.
Enter the choices 1 and 2 and their respective grades as shown.
A student who marks only 1 correct answer gets 0.5 marks.
And the student who marks both correct answers gets 1 mark.
Enter the choices 3 and 4 and their respective grades as shown.
And I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%.
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
Next, let’s add a Short answer question.
The student will be expected to type in a word or phrase, in response to the question.
Click on Create a new question button and double-click on Short answer option.
Create the question as shown.
In Case sensitivity dropdown, select No, case is unimportant.
The correct answer to this question is “same logarithmic spiral”
I am willing to give full marks to a student if whose answer is either:
However, if the student writes “logarithmic spiral” as the answer, I will give half mark.
Scroll down to the answers section.
Fill in Answer 1 and 2 and their respective grades as shown.
Notice the asterix in Answer 1 text.
So for eg: A student writes The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is the same logarithmic spiral.
Fill in Answer 3 and its respective grade as shown.
Notice there is no asterix before the answer text.
So for example: A student writes The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is not the same logarithmic spiral.
Fill in Answer 4 and its respective grade as shown.
Notice that I have awarded only 50% marks to this answer.
In the feedback textarea, type “You need to specify that it’s the same spiral and not any spiral.”
This explanation will be shown to the student as feedback.
Once again, I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%.
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
Let us now add a Numerical question.
Click on Create a new question button and double click on Numerical option.
Create the question as shown.
The answer to this question is 5mm.
The error margin here is 0.5.
Scroll down to the Answers section.
Enter the Answers, Error and grades as shown.
Expand the Unit handling section.
I will select the option - The unit must be given, and will be graded.
The Unit penalty field, by default, shows 0.1
So the student will get half of the marks if they write the answer without mentioning the unit.
In the Units are input using dropdown, I will select the text input element option.
This means the student has to type the unit along with the answer.
Expand the Units section.
Write Unit as mm and multiplier is 1. This means the answer choices are in mm.
Once again, I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%.
And then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
In this tutorial, we learnt about: Question bank in Moodle
Categories of questions and How to add questions to the question bank.
Here is a small assignment for you: Add more questions in the question bank.
Refer to the Assignment link of this tutorial for details.
Pause this tutorial and resume when done.
We should now have 10 questions in this question bank.
This script has been contributed by Nancy and Priyanka.
Welcome to the second part. Here I’ll show you how to edit your "login dot php" page to connect to the database and also how to check our username and password against that in the database.
Now we’ve already connected to our database.
Refreshing this and resending my username and password, we can establish that there have been no errors.
I mean this error here. And we have seen that if we don’t type data we will get an error.
Now, first of all I’m going to setup a query.
If you have used "mysql" or any structured query language before, you will know that you can query a database.
I think Microsoft Access has this.
So, here we are going to say, SELECT, in fact we’re going to say "SELECT *" because we need the ID, the username and the password.
I don’t think we need the id but "SELECT *" anyway so that it will grab all the data.
So "SELECT * FROM" and we’ve called this 'users', I think. Let me confirm that.
Yes, 'users'.  So "SELECT * users" and here we’ll say "WHERE username" which is the name of this...... this, here.
And we will say "WHERE username equals" the "username" that has been typed.
Now, if that "username" doesn’t exist, we need to display some kind of an error message to say that "This user doesn’t exist".
So, what we will do is we will use another function, a 'mysql' function called "mysql_num_rows()".
This counts the number of rows that have been retrieved from the query you’ve given the database.
So we’ll say $numrows equals mysql_num_rows() and in the brackets we have the name of our query, the variable that I have stored the query function in.
And if we echo out the number of rows, I’ll just prove to you and test for myself that we should get 1 because we have just 1 row.
Let me click Insert and add another row of data, for example - another "username" and another "password".
I’ll just try that now. I’ll be testing this later on. Let's see, let's say 'username'is "Kyle" and 'password' is "123" this time.
Okay, let's try that. And there we are. Hold on a second.  Where am I?  Ah there we go.
So we have got "Alex" and "Kyle".
We can see the "ids" have been automatically incremented.
You can see both our passwords here and the 2 'usernames'.
Now we will refresh this and see what we get.
Oh Ok. This is the whole part of the check.
The reason this has returned 1 is that if I were just selecting every user and then counting the row, the value would increment.
Go back here and refresh and we’ll get the value of 2 because there are 2 rows.
But if I’m saying "SELECT where the username equals my username", we’re obviously only selecting where my username exists and that is in 1 row.
Usually on a website, you won’t have duplicate username.
Okay. So now that we have got this, what is the purpose of finding out how many rows there are.
Now the purpose is that we can say if "num_rows is equal to zero", then that means we can.. sorry, if "my num_rows doesn’t equal zero" then we can execute the code we need to do, that we will need to login.
Otherwise, sorry else, we need to echo out, sorry  else die. We will give the message "That user doesn’t exist".
So, what we’re doing is, we’re checking that a row has been returned where we have supplied that username.
And if it doesn’t equal zero, we can execute our code to login.
Otherwise we’ll say die and "That username doesn’t exist".
This will be equal 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on.
Sorry it will equal...
If it doesn’t equal zero, then it must equal something.
And if it does equal something, then the code in here will be executed.
So, if it is equal to 0, that basically means that no result can be returned.
I’ll resend this.  Let’s go back.
And.... let’s get rid of our "echo num_rows".
Okay. So let’s go back to our main page and we’ll login with "Alex" and "abc"; password doesn’t matter at the moment.
Nothing’s happened because no errors have been returned.
Now let me use Billy, for example, and type the password in and click on Login.
"That user doesn’t exist!" because no rows that have the 'username' equal to "Billy" have been returned.
So, we can see that that’s working.
I’ll go back to my original thing.
So "Alex" and my password is "abc".
Now the code to login.
In order to login, we need to perform a password check.
So, to grab the password, I’ll use a function.
Sorry not a function, I’ll use... a loop and that loop will be the while loop.
I will type a variable name here. I’ll call it $row and that is equal to "mysql"..... "mysql_ fetches a row as an array". Okay?
So, I’ll say "mysql_fetch_assoc" for short.
And this is going to be my query.  So I’ve got my $query there.
From this, we are fetching each column data from here and putting it into an array called "$row".
So, obviously with the while loop, we’ll have our brackets and now we’ll set some variables.
I’ll say "$db username" which is the username that I’ll extract from the database, is equal to the "$row" and this is the row name, "username".
So, as we can see here, this is the row name here.
If this is an array of the data then each of these are going to be "id", "username" and "password".
We’re not using 0,1,2. But I’m not sure whether that works.
Now we’ll keep it simple and we’ll  directly reference the name of our column.
So, the database username will be "row" and since this is an array which is using this function on our query.
Next we will say "$db password" equals "$row" and then our 'password'.
So, after this we could echo out....
No, in fact we don’t need to echo out our contents of our 'db username' and 'password' unless we want to run into errors.
We already know what they are.  We’ve seen them in the database.
Now what we’ll do is we will perform a check.  So "check to see if they match".
It’s very simple to do this using an if statement.
if our $username equals our $db username AND our $password is equal to our $db password then we’ll say it’s correct.
Otherwise, we’ll say it’s incorrect.
I will remove the brackets because there is only one line. So echo "Incorrect password!".  Just leave it like that.
And here we’ll say echo "You’re in!".
Okay, we’ll just test this before I end this part of the video.
I’ll first say "Alex" and I’ll put a wrong password in. "Incorrect password!".
And now I’ll put "abc" as password and "You’re in!".
So, we’ve checked our "username" and it exists.
We’ve checked our fields exist so please enter in your "username" and "password".
If we enter in a "username" and a wrong "password" we get an error message – "Incorrect password".
If we enter the correct password, we get- "You’re in".
And if we enter a "username" that is not found, we get an error message saying the "user doesn’t exist".
Okay, so join me in the next part and I’ll show you how to create your sessions and your log out page. See you then!
This is Antara, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.
Welcome to the  Spoken Tutorial  on  Common Edit Functions  in  gedit Text editor .
In this tutorial, we will learn about editing functions that we use frequently in  gedit .
We will learn to:
We will also learn to  Print  our document.
Let's open the  gedit Text editor .
Now open the file  Students.txt  which we created earlier.
Let’s do so by clicking the icon in the toolbar with the icon labelled Open.
This is the shortcut icon to open an existing file.
Open Files  dialog box appears.
Select the  Desktop  folder on the right hand side.
Select the file  Students.txt  and click  Open .
Now, let's learn how to  cut, copy  and  paste   the text.
First, we need to select the text that we want to  cut  or  copy .
I want to cut the first three students details from this file.
To select the first three student details, click and drag the cursor across those three lines.
Now, the text is selected.
We can use the  Cut  icon in the  Toolbar . Or From the  Main  menu, select  Edit  and Cut .
Alternately, we can press  Ctrl + X  keys together to cut the text.
Notice that the selected text is no longer visible in the file.
Please note, however, that this text is not deleted.
It is stored in a part of the computer's memory known as the  clipboard .
The  Clipboard  stores content that is either cut or copied.
Content is stored temporarily until it is pasted or other content is copied.
Clipboard  content is deleted from memory once you exit  gedit .
Switch back to  gedit .
Let us now  paste  this text in a new document.
From the  Main  menu, click  File  and  New .
A new document named  Untitled Document 1  opens in the  gedit  window.
Now, from the  Main  menu, select  Edit  and  Paste .
Alternately, we can press  Ctrl + V  keys together to paste the text.
Or, use the  Paste  icon in the  Toolbar .
The text from the  Students dot txt  gets pasted into this document.
Select the tab  Students.txt .
Now, let's select the remaining students' details and make a copy of this.
From the  Main  menu, select  Edit  and  Copy .
We can also use the keyboard shortcut  Ctrl + C  to copy the content.
Notice that the copied text is still visible.
This text is also stored in the  clipboard .
Select the tab  Untitled Document 1.
Place the cursor after the third line and press  Enter .
Now, right-click for the context menu and select  Paste .
The content is pasted in the specified location.
This is a simple and effective way to cut, copy and paste content in  gedit .
Next we will see  Undo  and  Redo  options.
gedit Text editor  allows to  Undo  any changes that are made in a file.
Basically, it erases the last change done to the document.
This is useful when you have made a mistake and want to  Undo  it.
The keyboard shortcut for  Undo is Ctrl + Z .
The opposite of    Undo    is    Redo .
The    Redo   command reverses the Undo action.
The keyboard shortcut for    Redo    is    Shift + Ctrl + Z.
Now switch to  gedit Text editor .
Right-click and select    Undo   .
The text that we copy and pasted, is no longer visible.
The    copy-paste    action has been undone.
Let’s undo once again. This time, press    Ctrl + Z    keys together.
We can see the cursor jumps back to the end of the third line.
The previous action has been undone now.
Right-click and select    Undo    again.
The first three lines that we pasted earlier are also no longer visible.
We can also use the    Undo     icon in the    Toolbar   .
This is how we can    undo    all the actions we did so far.
Now, how can we get back the text again?
Simple! Right-click and select   Redo  .
Let’s redo our action one more time.
This time let’s press    Shift + Ctrl + Z  keys.
We can also use the  Redo   icon in the  Toolbar  .
We got back the text again.
And now, we can see only the student details from   Students.txt   files is copied in our   gedit   window.
Next, we will see the   Search  and   Replace   options.
It’s difficult to search for a particular word in a file, that has hundred lines of text.
Search function allows to search for one or all instances of the word, in the entire document.
Let us Switch back to    gedit Text editor  .
Let me open a document    school.txt  which I have already created earlier.
The   school.txt   file is available in the   Codefile   link along with this tutorial.
Download and use that text document.
In this document, I want to search for a particular word.
To do so, from the   Main menu, click on    Search    then   Find  .
Alternately, we can press   Ctrl + F   keys together.
Or, use the   Search for text   icon in the   Toolbar .
Find   box opens at the top right corner of the window.
In the   Find   Box, type the word   School  .
Observe that all instances of the word   school   are highlighted in yellow color in the document.
The first occurrence of the word   school  is highlighted in brown color.
Now place the cursor on the   Find  box and right-click the mouse.
From the list of options that appears, click on   Match Case  .
Only one word matches the case option. That is, capital 'S' in the word  School. .
Again, place the cursor on the   Find   box and right-click the   mouse  .
Now, from the   Main   menu, click   Search   and then on   Replace  .
Alternately, we can press   Ctrl + H keys together. Or, use the   Search for and replace text  icon in the   Toolbar  .
Replace   dialog-box appears.
In the  Search for  field, type "schools" and press  Enter .
In the  Replace with   box, type "colleges". Check the  Match entire word only  check-box.
We can see, all the  schools   words are highlighted in yellow color.
Click on  Replace  button.
This will replace the first occurrence of  schools   with  colleges .
Click on  Replace All  button to replace all the occurrences of  schools   with  colleges .
Click on  Close  button to close the window.
gedit Text editor  also allows us to search as we type.
Press Ctrl and F keys together to open the Find box.
Now, in the  Find box, start typing "Students" .
Notice that as we type the first letter  S  the cursor highlights all the   S letters in the document.
Finally, the entire word  Students  is highlighted when we finish typing.
Next we will see how to print the  school.txt  file.
Select  File   from the Menu bar  and then  Print .
We can also click on the  Print  icon in the  Toolbar .
Print  dialog-box appears.
If a printer is connected to your machine, it will be listed under the  Printer details here.
The tabs and selections in this window will be as per the default configuration settings.
To print your document, click on the  Print  button at the bottom right.
If the printer configurations are correct, then your document will get printed.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarise.
Here is an assignment for you-
Open the  School.txt  file in  gedit .
Copy the first paragraph and paste it in a new document.
Save the new document as  SchoolNew.txt .
Type the heading as "About School" in the first line. Undo the changes.
Note the changes in the contents of the file.

Welcome to this tutorial on Pipe Operator.
In this tutorial,we will learn about:
summarise and group_by functions
Operations in summarise function
Pipe operator
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Basics of statistics
Basics of ggplot2 and dplyr packages
Data frames
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A data frame moviesData.csv
A script file myPipe.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to pipeOps folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set pipeOps folder as my Working Directory.
Now we learn about summarise function.
summarise function reduces a data frame into a single row.
It gives summaries like mean, median, etc. of the variables available in the data frame.
We use summarise along with group_by function.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myPipe.R in RStudio.
Run this script by clicking on the Source button.
movies data frame opens in the Source window.
In the movies dataframe, scroll from left to right.
This will enable us to see the remaining objects of the movies data frame.
To know the mean of imdb_rating of all movies, we will use summarise function.
Click on the script myPipe.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Inside the summarise function, the first argument is a data frame to be summarised.
Here, it is movies.
The second argument is the information we need, that is the mean of imdb_rating.
Save the script and run the current line by pressing Ctrl+Enter keys simultaneously.
The mean value is shown.
One will argue that I can find the mean by using mean function along with dollar operator.
What is the use of installing a whole package and using a complex function?
Basically, we do not use summarise function for computing such things.
This function is not useful unless we pair it with group by function.
When we use group_by function, the data frame gets divided into different groups.
Let us switch back to RStudio.
In the Source window, click on movies data frame.
In the movies data frame, scroll from right to left.
We will group the movies data frame based on the genre.
For this, we will use group underscore by function.
Click on the script myPipe.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the current line.
A new data frame groupMovies is stored.
Now, we will use summarise function on this data frame.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the current line.
I will resize the Console window
The mean values of all movies in different genres are displayed.
Notice that, Documentary genre has the highest mean imdb_rating.
And Comedy genre has the lowest mean imdb_rating.
I will resize the Console window
In the Source window, click on movies data frame.
In the movies data frame, scroll from left to right.
Let us find the mean imdb_rating distribution for the movies of Drama genre.
Also, we will group movies of Drama genre by mpaa_rating.
For this, we will use filter, group_by, and summarise functions one by one.
Click on the script myPipe.R
In the Source window, type the following commands.
First, we will extract the movies of Drama genre.
Then, we group these movies based on mpaa_rating.
Finally, we apply summarise function.
This will calculate the mean of the filtered and grouped movies.
Run the last three lines of code.
I will resize the Console window
The required mean values are printed on the console.
I will resize the Console window again.
In this code, we have to give names to each and every intermediate data frame.
But there is an alternate method to write these statements using the pipe operator.
The pipe operator is denoted as %>%.
It prevents us from making unnecessary data frames.
We can read the pipe as a series of imperative statements.
If we have to find the cosine of sine of pi, we can write
Let us switch to RStudio.
We will learn how to do the same analysis by using the pipe operator.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here three lines of code have been written as a series of statements.
We can read this code as,
Using the movies data frame, filter the movies of Drama genre
Next, group the filtered movies by mpaa_rating
Finally, summarise the mean of imdb_rating of the grouped data.
This code is easier to read and write than the previous one.
In the case of pipe operator, we don’t have to repeat the name of the data frame.
Notice that we have written name of the data frame only once.
Save the script and run the current line.
I will resize the Console window.
The required mean values are printed on the Console.
I will resize the Console window again.
In the Source window, click on movies data frame.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
Let us check what is the difference between critics_score  and audience_score of all the movies.
We will use a box plot for our study.
By using the pipe operator, we can combine the functions of ggplot2 and dplyr packages.
Click on the script myPipe.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
The required box plot appears in the Plots window.
In the Plots window, click on the Zoom button to maximize the plot.
Here you can see that for the genres Drama, Horror, and Mystery & Suspense movies, the median is close to zero.
This means that the audience and critics opinions are very similar for these genres.
Whereas for Action & adventure and Comedy movies, the median is not close to zero.
This means that the audience and critics opinions are different for these genres.
Close this plot.
In the Source window, click on movies data frame.
In the Source window, scroll from right to left.
Let us check the number of movies in every category of mpaa_rating of each genre.
Click on the script myPipe.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Notice that we have included both genre and mpaa_rating in group_by function.
So, the analysis will be done on the data divided by these 2 variables.
Also, we have used num = n().
The function n computes the number of times the event with specific condition has happened.
Run the current line.
I will resize the Console window.
From the output, we can see that there are 22 Action and Adventure movies with mpaa_rating as R.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
summarise and group_by functions
Operations in summarise function
Pipe operator
We now suggest an assignment.
Use the built-in data set iris.
Using the pipe operator, group the flowers by their species.
Summarise the grouped data by the mean of Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width.
Please contact us.
Please post your general queries in this forum.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Neuron PhET simulation.
In this tutorial we will, Demonstrate Neuron, PhET simulation.
Here I am using, Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04
Java version 1.7.0
Firefox Web Browser version 53.02.2
To follow this tutorial, Learner should be familiar with topics in high school biology.
Using this simulation we will learn about, Movement of ions across the membranes when the neuron is stimulated or at rest.
Function of leak and gated channels
Membrane permeability.
Sequence of events that generates an action potential
I have already downloaded Neuron simulation to my Downloads folder.
To open the simulation, right click on Neuron_en.html file.
Simulation opens in the browser.
The simulation window shows a cross-section of an axon.
The nerve fibre or axon is like a cylinder.
The interior of axon is filled with axoplasm.
Exterior is covered with a thin axon membrane.
Different types of ion channels are present on axon membrane.
On the top-left corner of the screen, we have a zoom slider.
This helps to see the close-up view of the membrane.
On the right-side of the interface, you will see a Legend box and Show box.
Legend box shows ions and channels.
In the Show box, we have check boxes to show, All Ions ,Charges ,Concentrations Potential chart .
At the bottom of the screen we have, a box with Fast Forward, Normal and Slow Motion radio buttons.
Rewind, Play/Pause and Step buttons
Stimulate Neuron button and Reset button
In this simulation, we will see the movement of, sodium and potassium ions across the axon membrane.
About Neuron :Neurons are highly specialized cells in nervous system.
They can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli.
Drag the zoom slider, to zoom-in the axon membrane.
The ion channels are selectively permeable to different ions.
Here, 2 different types of ion channels are shown.
Leak Channel and Gated Channel.
For reference please refer to the Legend panel on the right-side of the screen.
There are sodium and potassium, Gated and Leak channels in the Legend panel.
Leak ion channels are always open.
They are responsible for the resting membrane potential.
Gated Channels open or close in response to a stimulus.
To observe the exchange of ions properly, keep the simulation speed slow.
Click on Slow Motion radio button at the bottom of the screen.
Sodium and potassium ions are seen continuously moving in and out of the membrane.
They move through the respective leak channels.
In the Show box, check against Charges and Concentrations check-boxes.
Note the concentrations of potassium and sodium ions, outside and inside the membrane.
Axoplasm will contain high concentration of potassium ions and low concentration of sodium ions.
The fluid outside the axon contains low concentration of potassium ions and high concentration of sodium ions.
This forms a concentration gradient across the membrane.
As a result, outer surface of the membrane is positively charged.
While its inner surface becomes negatively charged.
Therefore the membrane is polarised.
Resting Potential.
The electrical potential difference across the axon membrane is called Resting Potential.
In the Show box, check the check-box for Potential Chart.
To stimulate the neuron, click on Stimulate Neuron button.
Notice that Sodium ions move inside and potassium ions move outside.
During the exchange of ions charges get exchanged.
Notice the change in polarity across the axon membrane.
At this stage the nerve fibre is said to be in action potential or depolarized.
This movement of ions happen through gated channels.
Pause the simulation briefly.
Observe the increase in the membrane potential in the potential chart.
Action potentials in neuron are known as nerve impulses.
Click on Play button to start the simulation.
After a period of action potential, again reversal of the process takes place.
During this process the sodium and potassium ions move in and out.
This restores the resting potential of the membrane.
This process is called repolarization.
Now the fibre is ready to receive responsive stimulations.
In this tutorial we have demonstrated, How to use, Neuron PhET simulation.
Using this simulation we have learnt about, Movement of ions across the membranes when the neuron is stimulated or at rest.
Function of leak and gated channels.
Membrane permeability.
Sequence of events that generates an action potential.
As an Assignment : Observe, the difference between a gated channel and a leak channel
the sequence in which ion channels open or close to propagate an action potential.

Welcome to the 5th part of the User Registration tutorial.
In the last part, you saw that I registered myself in this database.
Everything has worked out fine and I am at the login screen here.
Let me type this in Username and type in my password.
It will tell me "That user doesn't exist".
At the part where we compare our passwords to check if they match.
That's checking our username there and this is checking our password.
"slicer u k 1". Okay, and this is checking this and this password here is equal to slicer u k 1.
Let me go back and refresh this.
So we are going to increase the limit for this to, say, 100.
I am going to browse our table and delete this value. Then I am going to go back and re-register.
So, register.  Choose your 'username'.
Now, let's check our database again.
This is followed on from our User Login tutorial.
So by putting these together, we have got a fully functional user register and login process.
Please subscribe for updates in the future. Thanks for watching.  This is Madhur, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project.
Welcome to this tutorial on Greenhouse Effect, an  interactive PhET simulation.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate Greenhouse Effect, using Interactive PhET simulation.
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of high-School science.
Here I am using- Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04
Java version 1.7.0
Using this simulation, students will learn:
2. Explore and compare the atmosphere of Ice age and today.
3. Effect of Glass panes and Clouds on atmospheric temperature.
4. Interaction of photons with atmospheric gases.
5. Contribution of atmospheric gases to Greenhouse Effect.
Greenhouse Effect:
This effect is caused by gases in the atmosphere.
They retain the heat radiated back from earth's surface.
This slide shows greenhouse gases and their percentages.
This process is similar to what happens inside a Greenhouse.
In cold places, fruits and vegetables are grown in glass covered area called a Greenhouse.
In a Greenhouse, solar radiations pass through the transparent glass and heat up the soil.
Some of this heat is absorbed by the glass and some is reflected.
This mechanism keeps the energy of the sun trapped in the Greenhouse.
Use the following link to download the simulation.
I have already downloaded the Greenhouse Effect simulation to my Downloads folder.
I will open the simulation using the terminal.
Open the terminal.
Then type: java space hyphen jar space greenhouse_en.jar and press Enter.
Greenhouse Effect simulation opens.
The simulation has 3 screens:
Greenhouse Effect screen shows Earth's atmosphere.
Light from Sun is depicted as yellow photons.
The radiated heat from Earth's surface is shown as red infrared photons.
On the right-hand side panel, we have options to explore the atmosphere.
By default, Atmosphere during is set as Today.
Observe the composition of greenhouse gases for Today's Atmosphere.
There is a thermometer to record the temperature in Kelvin and Fahrenheit scales.
Options panel has radio-buttons to display temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius units.
At the bottom of the screen, there are buttons to Pause and Play simulation.
Drag the slider to change the speed of the animation from fast to slow.
Click on Adjustable concentration button.
It will increase the concentration of greenhouse gases.
Then drag the Greenhouse Gas Concentration slider towards Lots. .
As the concentration of greenhouse gases increases, temperature increases.
Does clouds in atmosphere help in reducing the Greenhouse Effect?
Add Clouds to the simulation from the Options menu.
Observe the temperature. Note that Clouds will help the atmosphere to retain heat.
You can also compare the atmosphere during 18
Click on 1750 radio-button.
Note the composition of greenhouse gases.
Click on Ice age radio button.
Note the change in composition of greenhouse gases.
Percentage composition of greenhouse gases in Ice age is much lower.
Click on Reset All button at the bottom of the screen to reset the simulation.
Click on Yes to confirm your action.
Now, let us explore other screens in this window.
Click on Glass Layers tab.
Here, we have an option to add Glass Panes to the simulation.
This helps to understand the effect of Glass Panes on atmospheric temperature.
Let us add a Glass Pane and observe the change in temperature.
Add more Glass Panes and see what happens.
Click on Photon Absorption tab.
Drag the Infrared Photon slider to release the photons.
Click on Atmospheric Gases radio buttons, one by one, and check the vibrations.
Click on Build Atmosphere radio button.
Drag the sliders for the respective atoms.
Then drag the slider for releasing Infrared or Visible Photons.
Observe the vibrations of the molecules.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about the effect of greenhouse gases on atmospheric temperature,
compared the atmosphere of Ice age and Today,
effect of Glass panes and Clouds on atmospheric temperature,
interaction of photons with atmospheric gases,
contribution of atmospheric gases to Greenhouse Effect.
As an assignment, compare atmospheric temperature during 18
Add Clouds to the simulation and observe the changes in the temperature.
Explore Glass layers and Photon Absorption screens.
Explain why Glass panes increase the temperature of the atmosphere.

Now, what I'll do is - I'm going to do the '2 times' table.
So, I'll scrap this and I'll say the following.
Now, to make this interesting, what I'll do is to make this as a $multiple,
and the $multiple up here
I can change this as I please.
There we are.
So that's the foreach loop.  Thanks for watching.
This is Madhur, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Conditional Branching in Scilab.
To practice this tutorial, open the Scilab console window on your computer.
We will discuss two types of conditional constructs in Scilab that is the  if-then-else construct and the select-case conditional construct.
The if statement allows us to execute a group of statements if a given condition is satisfied.
Let me give you an example:
n is equal 42 if n is equal to equal to 42 (n==42) then disp "the number is 42" end of if construct.
Here, 'is equal to'(=) is the assignment operator, which assigns 42 to the variable n,
and 'is equal to is equal to' (==) is the equality operator which checks for the equality between the right hand and the left hand side operands.
In this case 'n' and 42 and gives the result in Boolean.
Here the comma after the first line is optional.
Also the then keyword is optional.
It can be replaced by a comma or a carriage return.
The end keyword ends the if construct.
On executing the script, we see the output as follows.
So far we have seen how to execute a set of statements, if a condition is true.
Now we will see how to execute another set of statements if that condition is false or we may wish to check if some other condition is satisfied.
We can do this by using else or elseif keyword respectively.
Here is how we do it.
In this example, 54 is assigned to a variable 'n' and checked for both true condition using 'if' and false condition using 'else' as described:
I will cut this, paste in the Scilab console, hit Enter.
You see the output.
If you notice, the examples shown above are on multiple lines.
They can also be written in a single line with proper semicolons and commas.
I will cut this and paste in the Scilab to execute. Hit Enter.
The select statement allows to combine several branches in a clear and simple way.
Depending on the value of a variable, it allows to perform the statement corresponding to the case keyword.
There can be as many branches as required.
Let us try with an example.
We will assign 100 to a variable 'n' and check the cases 42, 54 and a default case represented by else.
Cut,  paste, hit Enter.
Here we see the output .
This brings us to the end of this Spoken Tutorial on Conditional Branching using Scilab.
In this tutorial we have learnt the if - elseif - else statement and the select statement.
Thanks for joining good bye.
Hello everyone.Welcome to the tutorial on Introduction to Netbeans IDE.
In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the basics of getting started with Netbeans.
Netbeans is a free and open-source Integrated Developement Environment, available at www.netbeans.org.
It allows for integration of various components.
Supports various scripting languages and advanced text editors.
It also provides a 'GUI' to create and design projects and also supports databases.
To finish this tutorial, basic knowledge in the Java programming language is necessary.
Standard programming terminologies have been used in this tutorial.
To get started with Netbeans-
I am using the Linux operating system Ubuntu, version 11.04
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
In this tutorial, we will: * look at the installation of Netbeans
get familiarized with the interface of Netbeans and
create a sample Java project.
Let us first look at installing the IDE.
Netbeans can be downloaded from netbeans.org.
It is official main site.
Click on the "Download" link on the main page of the site.
On the next page which loads,
click on the 'Download' link in the last column which includes the download of all the supported technologies that is required by the IDE including the Glassfish Server.
The installation of Netbeans also requires the installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK) which can be downloaded from java.sun.com.
Click on the Get Java link here and select the link to download both the Netbeans and 'JDK' Bundle.
In the next page which loads,
select the setup file which is compatible with your operating system.
On Ubuntu, the setup-file is downloaded as a  '.sh' (dot sh) file
i.e as a shell script file.
Run this file by going to the Terminal.
Navigate to the window or directory which contains the downloaded setup file and at the prompt,
type "sh" followed by the name of the downloaded file and press Enter.
This will start the installer which will take a few moments.
The installer appears on the screen.
You can follow the onscreen instructions to install the IDE on your system.
I will exit the installer now.
Let us now look at the Netbeans window.
To open or launch Netbeans on your Ubuntu Operating System-
Go to the menu item Applications >> Programming and click on the Netbeans IDE icon.
When you first launch the IDE, it opens the Netbeans start page.
The IDE window contains
menus in the menu bar,
toolbars  and
workspaces like the file system window,
the run time window and the output window.
The  main menu provides most of the commands you need to use Netbeans with, including-
creating, editing, compiling, running and debugging your projects.
The tool bar which is present below the menu bar  provides buttons for several frequently used commands on the menu bar.
Workspace is a collection of windows that are used for performing certain types of operations
such as editing in the workspace window , execution, output or debugging- which is present below the workspace.
Let us next create a Sample Java Project.
To create a java project, go to the File menu, click on New Project.
In the 'New project' Wizard box, under Categories ,
select Java. Under Projects, select Java Applications and click Next.
In the Name and Location page  of the wizard,
give your Project Name as "KeyboardReader".
Set the Set as Main Project check-box selected and
click Finish.
The project is created and opened in the IDE.
Once the project is created, you should be able to  see the Projects window on the left  side of the IDE windows
which contains a tree view of the components of the project including the source files, Libraries that your code depends on.
The Source Editor  is on the right with a file called  as  KeyboardReader.java  opened.
Now, in the main class, let us enter a sample java code.
This code reads input from the keyboard and gives an output indicating if the input is a whole number or a floating point number.
I am now copying this code onto my clipboard and pasting it over the existing code in the IDE workspace.
The next step is to run our project.
To run any project on the Netbeans IDE, there are 3 methods.
The first method is- you can click on the project node in the Projects window and choose Run from the contextual menu.
Or, you can go to the toolbar and click on the Run Project button.
Or, you can also  press the F6 key on your keyboard to run the project.
Let me right-click on the Project node and select the Run option.
When you run a Java application, the IDE builds and compiles the  application code and runs the program in the output window which appears below the Workspace.
The IDE has now prompted me to "Enter any Number".
Let me enter a random number and press Enter.
It says if the input is a whole number or a floating point number.
Now, to the assignment-
As an extension to the "KeyboardInputReader" project,
convert another project i.e. a temperatures converter application which takes an input temperature,
converts into Fahrenheit from Celsius and vice-versa.
And, displays the converted temperature in the output window.
I have already constructed the assignment.
Let us run the assignment.
The program has prompted me to enter the input temperature in the output window.
Let me enter a sample temperature, -40, in Fahrenheit and it shows me the converted temperature in Celsius.
If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos.

Thank you for joining us and enjoy exploring Netbeans.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First C++ program.
In this tutorial I am going to explain,
How to write a C++ program
How to compile it, How to execute it
We will also explain some common errors and their solution.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 and
G++ Compiler version 4.5.2 on Ubuntu.
To practice this tutorial,
You should be familiar with Ubuntu Operating System and an Editor
Some editors are 'vim' and 'gedit'.
I am using 'gedit' in this tutorial.
For relevant tutorial please visit our website which is as shown.
Let me tell you how to write a C++ program through an example.
Open the  terminal Window using Ctrl,  Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
To open the text editor, type on the terminal.
“gedit” space “talk” dot “.cpp” space ampersand “&” sign.
We use the “&” to free up the prompt.
Please note that all the C++ files will have the extension “.cpp”.
Now   Press Enter,
the text editor has opened.
Let us start to write a program.
Type double slash “//” space “My first C++ program”.
Here, double slash is used to comment the line.
Comments are used to understand the flow of program.
It gives us information about the program.
The double slash is called as single line comment. Now press Enter.
Type (hash) “#include”, space, opening angle bracket, closing angle bracket .
It is  a good practice to complete the brackets first, and then start writing inside it.
Now Inside the bracket, type “iostream” .
Here iostream is a header file.
This file includes the declaration of  standard input output functions  in C++. Now press Enter.
Type “using” space “namespace” space “std” and a semicolon “;” .
The using statement informs the compiler that you want to use the std namespace.
The purpose of namespace is to avoid name collisions.
It is done by localizing the names of identifiers.
It creates a declarative region and defines a scope.
Anything defined within a namespace is in the SCOPE of that namespace.
Here std is the namespace in which entire standard C++ library is declared. Now press Enter.
Type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket .
main is a special function.
It denotes that the execution of the program begins from this line.
The opening and the closing bracket is called as Parenthesis.
Parenthesis followed by main  tells the user that main is a function.
Here, the int main()  function takes no arguments and returns a value of type integer.
We will learn about data types in another tutorial.
Now  let us switch to the slides to know more about  main function.
Every program should have  one main function.
There should NOT be more than one “main” function.
Otherwise the compiler cannot locate the beginning of the program.
The empty pair of parentheses indicates that main has no arguments.
The concept of arguments will be discussed in  the upcoming tutorials.
Now come back to our program. Press Enter.
Type opening curly bracket “{”.
The opening  curly  bracket marks the beginning of the function main().
Then Type closing curly bracket “}”.
The closing bracket indicates the end of the function main().
Now, inside the bracket press enter twice.
Move the cursor one line up.
Indentation makes the code easier to read.
It also helps to locate errors faster.
So let us  give a  space here.
And type “cout” space two opening angle bracket '.
Here cout is a standard C++ function to print the output on the terminal.
Now  after the brackets, type within  double quotes.
Anything within the double quotes, in the cout  functions, will be printed.
Now inside a quote type“Talk to a teacher backslash n” (\n).
Here \n signifies newline.
As a result, after execution of the cout function, the cursor moves to the new line.
Every C++ statement must end with a semicolon.
Hence type it at the end of this line.
Semicolon acts as a statement terminator. Now press Enter.
Give a space here and  Type “return” space “0” and a semicolon “;”.
This statement returns the integer zero.
An integer has to be returned for this function because the function type is int.
The return statement marks the end of executable statements.
We will learn more about the returned values in another tutorial.
Now click on “Save” button to save the file.
It is a good habit to save files frequently.
This will protect you from sudden power failures.
It will also be useful in case the applications were to crash.
Let us now compile the program.
Come back to our  terminal.
Type “g++” space “talk.cpp” space hyphen “-o” space “output”.
Here g++ is the compiler used to compile C++ programs.
talk.cpp is our filename.
hyphen -o output says that the executable should go to the file "output".
We see that the program is compiled.
By typing ls space hyphen lrt, we can see that output is the last file to be created.
Let us  execute a  program,  type  “./output” (dot slash output).
And  Press Enter.
Here the output is displayed as “Talk to a teacher”.
Now let us see the common errors which we can come across.
Switch  back to  our text editor.
Suppose here we miss the }(closing curly bracket)
now save the file.
Let us execute. Come back to our  terminal.
Now compile and run the program using the command we used before. We see an error.
We see that there is an error at line no.7 in our talk.cpp file  that "expected curly bracket at the end of input".
Now  Come back to our  text editor .
As I said before, the closing curly bracket marks the end of the function main
Hence re-insert the bracket here. Now Save the file.
Let us execute it again.
You can recall the previously entered commands by using up arrow key.
That is what I did now.
Yes, it is working.
I will show you another common error.
Let us switch back to our text editor.
Now, suppose here we missed std.
Let us save the file.
Come back to our  terminal .
Let us compile .
We see that there is an  error at line no.3 and  line no.6 in our talk.cpp file.
That "expected identifier before 'semicolon' " and " 'cout' was not declared in this scope".
As cout is the standard C++ library function.
and the entire C++ library function is defined under std namespace .
Let us now  fix the error.Come back to our Text editor.  Type std here.
Let us save it.
Let us compile it again.
Yes, it is working.As an assignment,
write a program to print your name and city.
We used single line comment in this tutorial.
Now just try to give a multiline comment.
For more details, please  write to  contact @spoken-tutorial.org

Hello and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Formatting Tags in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or Text Editor and Web Browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML5
However you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
HTML allows us to do basic formatting of the content.
Formatting tags are exactly like the ones that are there in any word processor application.
Some of the formatting tags are:
Paragraph
Bold, Italic, Underline
Large and Small
Insert and Delete
Superscript and Subscript
Line Break
Horizontal Ruler and
We will learn them one by one.
In any document, we use headings for various purposes in various sizes.
HTML allows us to create headings with six different sizes.
Heading tag will start from h1 for large headings and end with h6 for smaller ones.
A line space will be added automatically before and after the headings.
Let us open our file MyFirstPage.html, which we created earlier.
In our code, we have already used  h1  heading tag.
Let me add a few more lines of code to this program.
Type the following lines with proper indentation, below the h1 heading tag.
Here I have used all the six heading tags one after another.
Press Ctrl + S keys to save this change.
Now let’s see the output on the browser.
Go to the folder where the file is saved.
Right-click and open with your preferred web browser.
Observe the differences in the size of the heading “Welcome to Farmer's Market”.
Using appropriate heading as per your need, you can create headings of different sizes.
Switch back to the editor.
Next we will see how to format the text to make it bold, italic and so on.
Add the following lines of code next to the paragraph in your file, as shown here.
This line of code will demonstrate the use of bold, italic and underline.
Here I have used the tag    for bold.
So any text written in between these <b> tags will appear bold in the output.
Likewise, the text within the    tag will be italic and
Please look at the way I have written them here.
I have used the underline tag inside the italic tag.
While using a tag inside another tag, always remember to close the tags in the reverse order.
Here I have opened the italic tag first and then opened the underline tag.
While closing, I have closed the underline tag first and then the italic tag.
Follow the same procedure while using nested elements in your future codes.
Save the file.
Let’s switch to the browser and refresh the page to see the output.
Observe the change in the content that is displayed.
Let’s come back to the editor.
To create a line break, we have to use the break tag.
So, let me delete this break tag and save the file.
Let’s switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice here, the line space between the first two lines is now reduced.
The existing line space is the one that is created by the heading tag.
Switch back to the editor and undo the changes.
Save the file.
Now come back to the browser and refresh the page.
Note that the break tag can be written as follows
It is a self-closing tag which doesn’t require an end tag.
Let’s come back to the editor now.
I will add a few more lines to this code.
Notice here - I have used the strikethrough and superscript tags.
Let’s save the code.
Then switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice the change - the word Rs.20 per kg has been struck through.
And the word “Today’s offer” appears as a superscript.
Switch back to the editor once again.
The content written within the
And the content written within the
For subscript, we should use the
In the next line, I will type the
This tag will create a horizontal line.
Save the code and switch to the browser.
Refresh the webpage.
Notice the horizontal line.
Come back to the editor.
Let me add some more lines of code here, after the hr tag.
Observe that I have used the small and big tags here, along with ins tag.
Save the code and switch to the browser.
Refresh the webpage.
Notice that the words “folic acid” appears smaller in size.
And the word “Vitamins” appear bigger in size, compared to the normal font size.
Let’s come back to our code file.
This effect is achieved by using the small and big tags.
The small tag make the content smaller and the big tag makes it larger.
Let’s go back to our webpage.
But recall that in our code, we have used insert tag.
The browser will print the underline and insert in the same style.
The insert tag is used to mention that the inserted content should be underlined.
Now let’s learn about anchor tag.
In our webpage we could have many links that navigate us to either-
This action can be created with the help of  anchor  tag
This tag is also called as hyperlink tag.
Let’s switch to the editor and type the following code after the second paragraph tag.
Then save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Here we can see the new text “Click Here” is displayed.
The text appears to be hyperlinked.
But when we click on it, nothing happens.
Let’s find out why that is so.
Anchor tag should always be declared along with its attribute - href.
href stands for hyperlink reference
The value of href holds the target link.
This is the syntax
The content within the Anchor tag is clickable.
By clicking on this text, we will be redirected to the targeted link.
The content can be a text or an image.
Let’s switch to the editor to modify the code.
In the next line after Click here, type the following code.
Now save the code.
We can see two links here.
In the first case “Click here”, I haven’t given any link and have just kept it as blank.
If the href value is empty, it will keep us on the same page.
In the next one, I have given the name of the HTML file which we have used for assignment.
Clicking on this link will take us to the mentioned page.
While redirecting to a local link, make sure that the specified HTML file is available in the same folder.
Or specify the filename along with the path
Target is another important attribute for the anchor tag.
It specifies where the target has to be redirected.
The values are:
_parent: Opens in the parent frame
_self: Opens in the same frame
_top: Opens in the full body of the window.
Let us switch back to the editor to try out one of the attributes.
Let’s add this line of code here.
In this line of code, I have given an external website link and set the target to a blank page.

And to represent this, I am going to create a variable called '$exp' for expire and this will be equal to the time().
So, let's refresh.  So you can see quite a lot of digits here.
We can replace the block commenting with line-comment to keep it neat.
Okay, so we'll get rid of this.
So, what I'll do is comment this out and here I will echo it out.
We have got 'name' and that is equal to "Alex" and we've got an 'age' which is equal to 19.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on 2 Dimensional Arrays in C and C++.
what is a 2 Dimensional array.
Let us start with the introduction to 2 dimensional Array.
2D arrays are stored in a row column matrix.
The left index indicates the row.
The right index indicates the column.
Starting index of a matrix or array in C and C++ is always 0.
Here, we see a 2 Dimensional array in a row column matrix.
Starting index is 0.
Now, let us see how to declare 2 dimensional array.
data-type ,array name, row and column.
example, here we have declared a 2 dimensional array num with 2 rows and 3 columns.
Now let us see an example.
I have already typed the program, let me open it.
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot c.
In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements of the 2 dimensional array.
Here we have declared variables i and j.
Then we have declared num1 with 3 rows and 4 columns.
And num2, again with 3 rows and 4 columns.
num1 and num2 are 2 dimensional arrays.
Here, we take elements of the matrix num1 as input from the user.
The elements are stored row-wise.
We have considered i for rows and j for columns.
This for loop will check the condition that i runs from 0 to 2.
This for loop will check the condition that j runs from 0 to 3.
Similarly, here we take elements of the matrix num2 as input from the user.
Here we display the matrix num1.
Here percent 3d is used to align the matrix on the terminal.
Now, here we display the matrix num2.
Then we add the num1 matrix and the num2 matrix and display the result.
This is our return statement.
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
To compile, type gcc space 2d hyphen array dot c space hyphen o space arr and press Enter.
To execute, type dot slash arr (./arr), now press Enter .
Here we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num1.
I will enter the values now.
Now we can see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2.
I will enter the values.
Here we can see the num1 matrix.
Here we can see the num2 matrix.
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.
I have already made the program. I will open it and explain.
This is the program for 2 Dimensional arrays in C++.
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot cpp.
The extension is dot cpp (.cpp).
This is our using statement.
Here we have cout function as we use cout to print the output in C++.
Then we have cin function. We use cin to read  a line in C++.
Here, we use  / t  bit mean horizontal tab that is equivalent to 4 spaces.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.
To compile, type g++ space 2d hyphen array dot cpp  hyphen o space arr1 and press  Enter.
To execute, type dot slash arr1, now press Enter.
Here we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num1.
I will enter the values.
Now, we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2.
I will give the values as:
We can see the num1 matrix, the num2 matrix.
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.
Come back to our slide. Let us Summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt:
To add elements in a 2D array.
To print 2D array.
And to calculate the sum of 2Dimensional array.
As an assignment: Write the  program that takes two 2Dimensional arrays as input from the user.
Subtract them and find the result.

These are indicated by the all too familiar black asterix.
Let's create an article now.
Type Sodium as the title of the article.
We will put some text into the text box: Article Text.
You can put any text of your choice here.
I will copy the text that I have in my Gedit text editor and paste it in the Article text.
Next, select the Category field on the right-hand side of the screen.
Default value of the field is Uncategorised.
Let's leave it as it is.
There is a field called  Featured which is a toggle button, with options Yes and No.
A featured article is one which will be displayed on the homepage of a website.
I will select Yes  in the Featured menu.
Let's now save and close the article.
Go to the toolbar at the top left corner of the page.
There are various save options here.
Out of the given options, I will click on Save & Close.

Let's open our webpage and see the article we have created.
On the top right on the administrative panel, there is a link  Digital India. Click on it.
This is the site name that we gave for the website, during installation of Joomla.
We are now on our homepage and you can see the article Sodium that we created on the homepage.
Let's close the browser window and go back to the administrative panel.
Now, let us learn to edit an existing article.
We will edit the article that we have just created.
Look for the article in the Article Manager and click on its title.
Right now, we have only one article. So, we will click on the  article Sodium.
It opens the page with the title: Article Manager: Edit Article.
I am going to add a line at the beginning of the text:
Sodium is one of the essential minerals required by our body.
This time, let us choose another option to save the changes in the article.
Click on Save in the toolbar.
It will save the article and load the page with Edit Article
which indicates that, the article is still open for editing.
Let's go to the website and verify our changes.
Click on Digital India link on the top right of the page.
Scroll down to see that the article is edited.
Close the browser window and go back to the administrative panel.
To make a copy of an existing article, there is an option Save as Copy  in the toolbar.
Let us try it.
Click on Save as Copy button.
This creates a new article which is a copy of our original one- Sodium.
Note that the system has generated a new title, Sodium (2), for the copied article.
Let us give the copied article a title of our choice.
In the  Title  textbox, type:  Benefits of Sodium.
Now select the Status as Published. Then click on the  Save & Close option in the toolbar.
We are back to the Article Manager  page.
See here, we have got a new article  named Benefits of Sodium in our list.
Go to the webpage and verify that we have 2 articles on the homepage.
Click on the Digital India link, on the top right.
Scroll down to see 2 articles:  Sodium and Benefits of Sodium.
Pause this tutorial and do it.
Click on the title Benefits of Sodium.
Append XYZ at the end of the text.

Welcome to this tutorial on Calculation of Bubble Points and Dew Points in DWSIM.
In this tutorial, we will learn to generate:  Bubble Point Temperature at a given pressure,
Dew Point Temperature at a given pressure.
To record this tutorial, I am using  DWSIM 5.2 (Classic UI) and Windows 10.
The process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS also such as-
To practice this tutorial, you should know to: add components to a flowsheet,
select thermodynamic packages and  add material stream and specify their properties.
The prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website spoken-tutorial.org
In this tutorial, using DWSIM, we will calculate:
Here we provide the compounds, inlet stream conditions and property package.
At the bottom, click on the Next button.
Now, in the Compounds Search tab, type: Methane.
Select Methane from ChemSep database.
Next, we will add Ethane.
Similarly, add Propane.
Next, add Isobutane.
Followed by N-butane.
Similarly, add Isopentane.
Then add N-pentane.
At the bottom of the window, click on the Next button.
The Property Packages opens.
From Available Property Package list, double-click on Soave-Redlich-Kwong.
The next option is System of Units.
At the bottom, click on the Finish button.
Now let’s insert a material stream for which we have to calculate Bubble points and Dew points.
In the Filter List tab, type: Material Stream.
Go to the Input Data.
Change Temperature to 25 degree Celsius and press Enter.
Now, for Methane, type the Amount as 0.05 and press Enter.
For Ethane, type it as 0.1 and press Enter.
Similarly, for Propane, type 0.15 and press Enter.
And for Isobutane, type 0.1 and press Enter.
Next, for N-butane, type 0.2 and press Enter.
For Isopentane, type 0.25 and press Enter.
Lastly, for N-pentane, type 0.15 and press Enter.
Now we will see how property package calculates phase equilibrium data of compounds.
To do this, go to Utilities.
Click on Add Utility.
In the Add Utility window, under Object Type, select Material Streams.
Under Utility Type, select Phase Envelope.
Under Flowsheet Object, select Feed.
Then, at the bottom, click on the Add Utility button.
Phase Envelope window opens.
Let us adjust the Phase Envelope window for better visibility.
Enter Name as BubblePoint-DewPoint.
Under Settings, click on Bubble Points tab.
Select the check box against Custom Initialization.
We are going to calculate bubble point temperature against given pressure.
So, let Initial Flash method be PVF.
Here, we will change only Initial Pressure and Pressure Step.
Type Initial Pressure as 1 bar and press Enter.
Type Pressure Step as 1 bar and press Enter.
We will not change any temperature value as we are doing a PVF Flash.
Now, go to Dew Points tab.
We will repeat the same process as Bubble Points Initialization.
Select the check box against Custom Initialization.
We are going to calculate dew point temperature against given pressure.
So, here also let the Initial Flash method be PVF.
Hence we will change only Initial Pressure and Pressure Step
Type Initial Pressure as 1 bar and press Enter.
Type Pressure Step as 1 bar and press Enter.
Now click on the Calculate button at the bottom.
The calculation process is running in the background.
We can see the dew points and bubble points generated at different pressure and temperatures.
Under Results, click on Table.
In the column Pb, look for 2 bar at which we had to calculate the bubble point.
Look for temperature in Tb column corresponding to 2 bar.
We can see the bubble point temperature to be minus 91.9274 degree Celcius
Next, we have to find Dew point temperature at 10 bar.
In the column Pd, look for 10 bar at which we have to find the dew point.
Here is 10 bar under Pd column.
Look for temperature in Td column corresponding to 10 bar.
We can see the dew point temperature to be 87.396 degree Celcius.
There is an alternative way by which we can verify the correctness of the above results.
For this, let’s get back to flowsheet window.
Click on Feed.
Under Input data, select Flash Spec as Pressure and Vapor Fraction (PVF).
Type Vapor Phase Mole Fraction as 0 and press Enter.
And, Pressure as 2 bar and press Enter.
Now check the temperature which is minus 91.9274 degree C.
This is the bubble point temperature at 2 bar pressure.
It matches the value obtained earlier from Phase envelope.
Similarly, let’s check for Dew point temperature.
Let the Flash Spec be same as Pressure and Vapor Fraction (PVF).
Type Vapor Phase Mole Fraction as 1  and press Enter.
And Pressure as 10 bar and press Enter.
Now, check the temperature which is 87.396 degree C.
This is the dew point temperature at 10 bar pressure.
It matches the value obtained earlier from Phase envelope.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to generate: Bubble Point Temperature at a given pressure,
Dew Point Temperature at a given pressure.
As an assignment, calculate the following for the given component system and inlet conditions.
Calculate Bubble Point Pressure at 20 degree Celsius.
Calculate Dew Point Pressure at 60 degree Celsius.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Comments in Perl.
comments in Perl.
I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 operating system and Perl 5.14.2
that is, Perl revision 5 version 14 and subversion 2.
You should have basic knowledge of compiling, executing and variables in Perl.
If not, please go through the relevant spoken tutorials on the spoken tutorial website.
Commenting a piece of code in Perl can be done in two ways:
Single Line ,  Multi-Line.
This type of comment is used when user wants to comment a single line of code or
to add one liner text to explain the functionality of a piece of code.
This type of comment starts with the symbol # (hash).
Here is a demo. Let us open a new file in the Text Editor.
Open the Terminal and type - gedit comments dot pl space &
Once again reminding you that the ampersand is used to free the command prompt in the terminal, now press Enter.
Now type the following commands.
hash Declaring count variable press Enter.
dollar count space equal to space 1 semicolon press Enter.
print space double quotes Count is dollar count slash n double quotes complete  semicolon space hash Prints Count is 1
Now save this file by pressing Ctrl S  and execute the Perl script.
Switch to the Terminal and type perl hyphen c comments dot pl and press Enter.
This tells us that there is no syntax error.
Now type: perl comments dot pl and press Enter.
It will show the following output - Count is 1
Let us switch back to gedit.
In gedit, go to the first line and press Enter.
Go back to the first line and type the following command.
Hash exclamation mark slash usr slash bin slash perl
This line in Perl is called as  shebang line and is the first line in a Perl program.
It tells where to find the Perl Interpreter.
Note: Though this line starts with hash symbol, it will not be considered as a single line comment by Perl.
Now let us look at multiline comments.
Multi Line: This type of comment is used
when user wants to comment a piece of code or  to add description/usage of piece of code.
This type of comment starts with the symbol equal to head and ends with equal to cut.
Let's switch back to gedit and type the following in the comments dot pl file.
At the end of file, type: equal to head, press Enter.
print space double quote count variable is used for counting purpose  double quote complete press Enter.
equal to cut
Save the file, close it and execute the Perl script.
On the Terminal, type: perl hyphen c comments dot pl and press Enter.
No syntax error.
So let us execute it, perl comments dot pl
It will show the same output as before. Count is 1.
It does not print the sentence “count variable is  used for counting purpose”.
This is because we commented the portion using equal to head and equal to cut.
You can either use  =head =cut or =begin =end.
These are not the special keywords used by Perl.
Please note, there should not be any leading or trailing space(s) before '='  (equal to sign) and after the head, cut, begin or end word.
Open the Terminal once again.
And Type -  gedit commentsExample dot pl space & and press Enter.
Type the following commands as shown on the screen.
Here, I am declaring two variables firstNum and secondNum and I am assigning some values to them.
Then I have commented this portion here.
Now I added these two numbers and assign the value to a third variable named addition.
Next, I want to print the value using print command.
Save the file and execute the Perl script on the Terminal.
On terminal, type: perl hyphen c commentsExample dot pl, press Enter.
There is no syntax error.
So, execute the script by typing
perl commentsExample dot pl press Enter.
It will show the following output. Addition is 30.
Here, we learnt to add comments in Perl.
Write a perl script to find square of a number.
Explain the functionality of the code written using single line comment & multiline Comment.

Hello everyone and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on construction of the mixing tank.
This is an activity to be done on Day-2.
In this tutorial, we will learn the significance of the mixing tank and how to construct a mixing tank.
Let’s first understand the significance of the mixing tank and the shape of the mixing tank.
Mixing tank is where biomass is mixed with water and passed into the digester tank.
The mixing tank is usually cylindrical in shape.
A mixing tank of height 2 feet and diameter 22 inches has the capacity to hold 25 kgs of manure mixed in water.
However, dry manure should never be put into this tank.
Manure should always be mixed in equal quantity of water.
For example, 25 kgs of manure should be mixed in 25 liters of water.
This will ensure free flow of the biomass into the digester tank.
Let’s see the construction of the mixing tank.
For construction, following items are used-
Weldmesh sheet of thickness 16 gauge,
some newspaper,
sand,
cement,
and liquid waterproofing material.
The step-by-step procedure to construct the mixing tank is as follows-
Spread the Weldmesh sheet of 69 inches x 24 inches on the ground.
Next, at a distance of 34 inches from one end of the sheet, make a hole of size 4 inch diameter with a metal cutting scissor.
Now tie the loose ends, end to end, with steel wire.
We need to make a cylinder like structure with diameter 22 inches and height 24 inches.
Note that the hole has to be at the base of the mixing tank.
Now, place newspaper or any other paper inside the structure.
The paper will help hold the sand that will be filled inside this structure.
Pour sand up till the brim of the structure. This will give firmness to the mesh while plastering the outer wall.
Now, we will plaster the outer wall of the mixing tank.
Prepare cement mixture as follows-
sand- 75 kgs,
cement-25 kgs,
liquid waterproofing material - 50 ml, thoroughly stirred in 10 litres of water
and adequate water to mix this mixture well. Note that no gravel is used in this mixture.
Start plastering the outside wall of the mixing tank as shown here.
Finally, smoothen the plastering using a wooden trowel.
The mixing tank should be left overnight for curing.
Next day, take out all the sand placed inside the mixing tank.
This must be done carefully so as to not break the plastered outer wall of the mixing tank.
Once the sand is taken out, plaster the inside wall of the mixing tank.
Prepare fresh cement mixture as was prepared for outer wall of the mixing tank.
Spread half inch of this mixture on the inside wall.
While plastering, please remember the position of the hole that is at the base.
We need to break the plaster from here, later.
Let the plaster on the inside wall dry for 6-7 hours.
After 6 to 7 hours, remove the plaster at the position of the hole by slightly tapping it.
At this point, the mixing tank is ready to be transferred to the actual plant site.
Remember, the following has to be completed on the same day i.e day-2 of civil work. Hence, the mason has to plan accordingly.
Assembly of the mixing tank for the biogas plant will be explained in a later tutorial.
Let’s Summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt the  significance of the mixing tank
and how to construct a mixing tank.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to do Cataloging in Koha.
To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04 and
Koha version 16.05.
If not, please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website.
Let us begin. Let me switch to the Koha interface.
Log in with Library Staff username Samruddhi.
Recall, we had given her Cataloging rights in an earlier tutorial.
Also recall, we had an assignment of adding a Book and  a Serial to our Library in one of the earlier tutorials.
We are now inside the Koha interface as Library Staff: Samruddhi.
On the Home page, click on Cataloging.
To start a new record, click on the tab  plus New record.
From the drop-down, I will select BOOKS.
The selection depends upon the ITEM type created in one of the earlier tutorials.
However, you may select as per the Item Type that you had created.
A new page with the title Add MARC record opens up.
Note that it is mandatory to fill the fields marked in red colored asterisk on this page.
Interestingly, Koha auto-generates values for a few mandatory fields.
Among the range of tabs from 0 to 9, we will start with tab zero.
Click inside the field for 000, LEADER.
By default, Koha shows this value.
I will leave the field for 001 CONTROL NUMBER as blank.
When 003 CONTROL NUMBER IDENTIFIER is clicked, Koha auto-generates this value.

In this tutorial, we will learn about Git repository and some basic commands of Git.
To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of running Linux commands on the Terminal.
If not, for relevant Linux  tutorials, please visit our website.
Now, we will see what is Git repository.
Git repository is a folder where all the data of our project will be stored.
It can be located on the local machine or on a remote machine.
The difference between normal folder and a Git repository is-
normal folder contains only files and directories
but the Git repository contains set of files and directories along with their complete history.
Now, let us learn to create a Git repository in our local machine.
Press Ctrl+Alt+Tkeys to open the terminal.
On my machine, I will create a directory for the Git repository in my Home directory.
You can create the directory wherever you want on your machine.
By default, we are in our Home directory.
Type: mkdir space mywebpage and press Enter.
So, now we have created a directory "mywebpage" in our Home directory.
To go into this directory, type: cd space mywebpage and press Enter.
To make "mywebpage" directory as the Git repository, type: git space init and press Enter.
You can see the message “Initialized empty Git repository”.
This indicates that Git is initialized successfully
and this is the path where Git repository is created in our system.
After initialization, a hidden folder dot git will be created inside the mywebpage folder.
To see the hidden folder, type: ls space hyphen a and press Enter.
It shows the dot git folder. Deleting this dot git folder will delete the whole repository.
So, you should be very careful with this dot git folder.
Now, we have to set our identity to Git.
To set the email address, type:  git space config space hyphen hyphen global space user dot email space priya[dot]spoken@gmail.com and press Enter.
Here, I have used priya[dot]spoken[at]gmail[dot]com.
You can use your own valid email address.
To set the username, type: git space config space hyphen hyphen global space user dot name space Priya and press Enter.
I have used "Priya" as a username. Please use your name instead of "Priya".
The name and the email address that we set are the identities of the person who is working on Git.
Next, I will configure the gedit text editor to give the commit message.
Type: git space config space hyphen hyphen global space core dot editor space gedit and press Enter.
Now, gedit is configured to Git.
Here, 'global' flag is optional.
We will switch back to our slides to know more about global flag.
Multiple repositories can be created in a single machine.
If you use hyphen hyphen global flag, the setting will be applied to all the repositories in the machine.
So, whenever you create a new Git repository, this setting will be applied by default.
If you want the identity only for a particular repository then do not use hyphen hyphen global flag.
Now, let us check the configuration details of the identity that we set earlier.
Type: git space config space hyphen hyphen list and press Enter.
Now, you can see the editor name, email address and username.
I will be using 'html' files for demonstration.
You can use any file type of your choice. For e.g. text files or doc files.
Switch back to the terminal. Let me clear the prompt.
Now, type: gedit space mypage.html space ampersand.
If you are using another file then give that filename instead of "mypage.html".
We use the '&' (ampersand) to free up the prompt. Now, press Enter.
I will copy and paste some code into this file, from my Writer document, which I had saved earlier.
Likewise, add some content into your file.
Now, I will save my file.
So, I have an html file with some code in it.
Note: wherever I use mypage.html, you will have to replace it with your filename.
Next, we will ask Git to follow the file "mypage.html".
Switch back to the terminal and type: git space add space mypage.html and press Enter.
Now, we will check the current status of Git. So, type: git space status and press Enter.
You can see “new file: mypage.html”. This means that Git has started following the changes made to this file "mypage.html".
This is called tracking.
Let us switch back to our file mypage.html
and add a few more lines of code to this file.
Like before, I will copy-paste from my Writer file.
Then switch back to the terminal. As before, to check the current status of Git, type: git space status and press Enter.
It shows: “Changes not staged for commit:” and “modified: mypage.html”.
Let us switch back to our slides to know more about Staging area.
Staging area is a file that stores information of the changes that need to be committed.
The file contents should be added to the staging area before committing them.
We will discuss more about commit in the upcoming tutorials.
Older Git versions used the term index instead of staging area.
Now, let us see how to add the new changes of the file to the staging area.
Switch back to the terminal. Let me clear the prompt.
Type: git space add space mypage dot html and press Enter.
To check the Git status, type: git space status and press Enter.
Now you can see the message: “Changes to be committed:”.
This means that the file has been added to the staging area and is ready to be committed.
Now, we will freeze our code at this point.
When we attain a particular stage in our work, we can save them in the repository. This is called commit.
Each commit is saved with the information of username, email-id, date, time and commit message.
Now, let us see how to commit. Switch back to the terminal and type: git space commit and press Enter.
gedit text editor opens up automatically to get the commit message.
In the first line, I will type: “Initial commit” as the commit message.
You can type any informative message that you want.
Here, you can see some lines begin with hash. You can leave them as it is or you can delete them.
Please write the commit message before or after the hash line.
In future, with this commit message, we can identify what we did till this stage.
Let me save and close the editor.
You will see some details, such as:
Now, let us see the commit details using git log command.
Type: git space log and press Enter.
We have only one commit in our repository.
It shows a unique ID which is called commit hash or SHA-1 hash.
Switch back to our slides to know more about SHA-1 hash.
SHA-1 hash is a unique id of 40 alpha-numeric characters.
Git stores all the information in its database by the hash value.
Git commits are identified by the SHA-1 hash.
You will understand the importance of the SHA-1 hash in future tutorials.
Let us come back to our terminal.
It shows the details of the commit such as author name, email address, date, time and the commit message which we gave earlier.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:
As an assignment- Create a directory in your machine and make it as a repository.
Create a text file and add some content into it.
Add the file to the staging area of the Git repository.
Commit the file to your repository and
See the commit details using git log command.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Block Elements and Layouts in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
And HTML5 layouts
To practise this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of HTML.,
If not, then go through the corresponding tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML5
gedit Text Editor
However you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Elements in HTML are classified into two types.
Block level elements
Block level elements are used to create individual blocks in the HTML document
Each block level element starts on a new line.
It also creates a line break at the start and end on its own.
We can create a block element inside another block element.
Whereas  Inline elements can be added anywhere in the line.
It won’t create any line break.
These are some of the block level elements.
These are some of the inline elements.
In this tutorial we will learn about div and span tags.
Division or div tag is a block level tag.
With the help of div tag and CSS, we can create:
For this demonstration, I have written some code and saved it as layout.html
I have already opened this file in a text editor.
I have created a section for News and added some content in it using the div tag.
Next I have created a section for an article about Spoken Tutorials on Web Technology.
I have written both these div blocks in an outer div block.
Open this file in a web browser to see the output.
Inside the second div tag let us add some styles.
Inside the style attribute, I have set the float property value as left.
This will align the elements to the left of the container.
I have set some more attributes like width, height and background color.
Likewise, let me add the styles for the 3rd div tag as shown here.
In the 2nd div tag, I have set the width as 20%.
In the 3rd div tag, I have set the width as 80%.
So this setting will split the display area as 20% for the 1st section and 80% for the 2nd section.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser  and refresh the page.
Likewise, you can create many other layouts on our own, using the div tags and styles.
We can create the same look using Table tag also.
But that is not a good practice for creating blocks or layouts.
Creating a block or layout using div tag is more easy and flexible.
But it requires lot of practice to become an expert in div tag for creating good layouts.
Now let us learn about the span tag.
Span tag can be  Used to group the inline elements
Used to set different styles for a particular section
Inserted anywhere inside any tag
Switch to the text editor.
Here let me set different colours for each list item using the span tag.
Update the code as shown here.
For each list item, I have set a different background colour using the span tag.
Save the file.
Switch  to the browser and refresh the page.
Observe the output now.
Come back to the text editor.
Let us change the colour of the text as well.
Save the file
Switch back to the browser and refresh the page.
In HTML5 we can also create layouts without the div tag.
For each part of the webpage, we have the layout elements.
<header> for Page headers
<nav> for Navigations or Links
<section> for Document sections
<article> for Articles
<aside> for Sidebar contents
<footer> for Page footer
These tags have a start and an end.
With the help of layout elements and CSS we can create attractive web layouts.
We will discuss this in detail in a later tutorial.
With this we come to the end of the tutorial.
Create a 3 column layout using div tag

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Create a 3-fold brochure” using Inkscape.
Use guidelines and to set them
Settings for a 3-fold brochure
Design a 3-fold brochure.
We will also learn the importance of using layers.
This is a sample 3 fold brochure. As we open it, we can see the 3 folds.
So, there are 6 sections in all.
The outer side contains sections 1, 5 and 6.
The inner side of the brochure contains sections 2, 3 and 4.
Let us learn how to create a brochure like this one.
Open Inkscape.
Click on File and go to Document Properties.
Let's do some basic settings first.
Change: Default units to mm
Page Size to A4
Orientation to Landscape
Custom Size Units to mm.
We have to divide the canvas into 3 folds.
For that, observe that the width of the canvas is 297.
So, we have to divide 297 into 3 parts which is 99 for each of the three sections.
Close the Document Properties dialog box now.
Click and drag a guideline from the left side onto the canvas.
Double-click on this guideline.
A dialog box opens up.
Change the value of 'X' to 99 and click on OK.
Click and drag another guideline from the left side onto the canvas.
Double-click on it to open the dialog box.
Here, change the value of X to 198.
Now our canvas is divided into 3 equal sections.
These guidelines tell us where each fold will start and end.
Let us save this file twice:
One for the inner side of the brochure
and the other for the outer side.
Go to File and click on Save as.
I will save the file on my Desktop with the name Brochure-OUT.svg.
Once again go to File and click on Save as.
This time, I will give the name Brochure-IN.svg and click on Save.
So, now we have 2 files- one for the inner section and one for the outer section.
Let us start with Brochure-IN.svg.
As we go about creating this brochure, it is desirable to use different layers for different elements.
Towards the end of this tutorial, we see the benefits of doing so.
Let us first design the inner sections of the brochure i.e. sections 2, 3 and 4.
Using the Bezier tool, draw a graphic illustration in the middle of the canvas. Color it blue.
Remove the stroke.
Create a new layer and name it as you prefer.
Create a circle of 150X150 pixels.
Color it green.
Duplicate the circle and create 5 more circles of different sizes as shown.
Place them around the graphic illustration as demonstrated.
Inside these circles, we will place some images.
I have already edited the images to a circular shape and saved them in my Documents folder.
For your convenience, these images have been provided to you in the Code files link.
Pause the tutorial, click on the link and save these images to your preferred location.
After this, resume the tutorial.
Go to File, click on Import and then on Image1.
Keep it on top of the first circle.
In a similar way, repeat the steps for the other 5 images.
Align them using Align and Distribute option.
Now, your canvas should look like this.
Next create a new layer.
Select the Bezier tool and draw an arrow.
Color it gray.
Remove the stroke.
Go to Filters menu. Select Shadows and Glows and then click on Drop Shadow.
Check on Preview box to notice the effect.
Now click on Apply. Close the dialog box.
Keep it on the top of the first circle in an overlapping manner, as shown.
Duplicate this arrow twice to create 2 more arrows.
Keep them on 2nd and 3rd circles respectively, as shown.
Now, all the graphic elements are done.
We will now insert the relevant texts.
On the new layer, type “Introduction” on the first arrow.
Type Features on the second arrow.
Type Usage on the third arrow.
Now, we have to insert the text under each of these sections.
I will copy and paste the texts from a LibreOffice Writer file that I have saved already.
This file is available to you in your saved folder.
Please locate it and copy the text from it.
Then paste it as shown on a new layer.
Reduce the font size to 15 and align them using Text and Font option.
Create a bullet of green color using the ellipse tool.
Place it to the right of the first sentence.
Repeat the same process for all the sentences.
Now the inner part of the brochure is ready.
Let's press CTRL + S to save our SVG file.
Now you can hide or show the layers that you want in the final brochure.
Let us now save the same file into PDF.
Go to File, click on Save As.
Change the file extension to PDF.
For printing purpose, the resolution must be 300.
For web, it can be 72.
Let me keep it as 300.
Now click on OK.
Let us now change the opacity of the arrows.
Go to the Arrow layer and change the opacity of the layer to 70.
I have also added a new layer with ink-blots.
Save the file in SVG and PDF formats.
Compare the 2 'pdf's to understand the difference.
Next, let us create the outer part of the brochure.
Go to File. Click on Open.
Select Brochure-OUT.svg.
Now we have to design the sections 1, 5 and 6.
Once again, remember to use different layers for different elements.
Draw a graphic illustration on the top left using the Bezier tool as shown.
Color it blue. Remove the stroke.
Import Spoken Tutorial logo which is in your saved folder.
Reduce the size and place it on the top left corner of the 1st section.
Type Spoken Tutorial and align it to the right of the logo.
Change the font size to 25.
Draw a circle below the text and color it yellow.
Import Inkscape logo.
Place it on the top of the yellow circle.
Type “Inkscape” below the logo. Change the font size to 45.
I have added details about Spoken Tutorial project and inserted the relevant logos.
Please do so likewise.
I have aligned all the elements using
Text and font
and Align and Distribute options.
Now the outer side of the brochure is ready.
Go to File.  Click on Save As.
Change the format to SVG and click on Save.
Repeat the same process.
Change the extension to PDF.
This is our completed brochure.
If you have used layers for the various elements then you can conveniently change the colours and opacity.
These are 2 other colour schemes that I have created for the same brochure.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Use guidelines and to set them
Settings for a 3-fold brochure
Design a 3-fold brochure.
We also learnt-the importance of using layers
and obtaining the same brochure in various colour schemes.
Here is an assignment for you-

Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on loops in BASH.
for loop
while loop
Let us start with an introduction to  loops.
Loops are used to execute a group of statements repeatedly.
Let us see the syntax.
for expression 1, 2, 3
statement 1, 2, 3
and this is the end of for loop.
An alternate syntax of for loop is:
for variable in sequence/range
statement 1, 2, 3
and end of for loop.
Let us see an example of for loop using the first syntax.
In this program, we will calculate the sum of first n numbers.
Note that our filename is for.sh.
The variable number will store the value given by user.
The value is an integer here.
Now, we initialize the variable sum as zero.
This is where we begin the for loop.
First, we initialize 'i' to 1.
Then we check whether 'i' is less than or equal to number.
Now here, we calculate the sum as sum plus i
and then we print it.
After this, we increment the value of 'i' by 1.
And then we check the condition till this condition is False.
On exiting the for loop, this message is printed.
Let us execute the program and observe what happens.
On the terminal, type - chmod +x for.sh
Then type: ./for.sh
I will enter 5 as the input number.
The sum that is calculated for each value of 'i' is displayed.
After that, the last line of the output is displayed:
"Sum of first n numbers is 15".
Now, let us see the flow of the program.
Let me resize the windows.
First, we have value of 'i' as 1.
Then we check whether 1 is less than or equal to  5.
Since the condition is True, we calculate the sum as 0 + 1.
Now we have the sum as 1.
Then we print sum  i.e 1.
Next, 'i' is incremented by 1 and the new value of 'i' is 2.
Then we check whether  2  is less than or equal to  5.
The condition is True and now sum will be  1 + 2  i.e  3.
'i' is then incremented by 1 and then the new value of 'i' is 3.
And we get sum as  6.
The script will continue to add the next value of 'i' to the previous value in  sum.
This will continue till i<=5 is False.
On exiting the for loop, the final message is printed.
Let us see another example of for loopusing the second syntax.
I have written the code in this file and named it as for-loop.sh.
This simple program will list the files in a directory.
Then we have for loop.
'ls'  command lists the directory content.
-1 (hyphen one) lists one file per line.
This will list all the files present in your home directory.
This is the end of for loop.
Let us execute the script on the terminal by typing -
chmod +x for-loop.sh
Type: ./for-loop.sh
This will display all the files present in the Home directory.
Now we will learn about  while loop.
Let us understand the syntax first.
while condition
This means that the while loop will execute as long as the condition is True.
Let us see an example of while loop.
Here, I have named it as while.sh.
In this program, we will calculate the sum of even numbers within a given range.
Here, we accept a number from the user and store it in variable number.
Next, we declare variables 'i' and sum and initialize them to  0 (zero).
Now, this is the while condition.
Here, we check whether 'i' is less than or equal to value of number given by the user.
Then we calculate the sum by adding value of 'i' to value of sum.
Next, we increment the value of 'i' with 2.
This will ensure that we only add the even numbers.
And the while loop is repeated till the value of 'i' exceeds the value of number.
When we exit the while loop, we print the sum of all the even numbers within the given range.
Type on the terminal:
chmod +x while.sh
./while.sh
I will give 15 as my input.
The last line of the output is:
"Sum of even numbers within the given range is 56".
Let me resize the window and explain the output.
First we check whether 'i' which is 0, is less than or equal to the number which is 15.
The condition is True. Hence sum will be '0+0' i.e 0.
Now 'i' will be incremented by 2 and the new value of 'i' is  2.
Then we check if 2 is less than or equal to 15.
The condition again is True; so we add 0+2.
Now sum  has the value 2.
Again the value of 'i' will be incremented by 2.
So, now value of 'i' will be 2+2 i.e 4.
And the next value of  sum  will be 4+2 i.e 6.
In the same way, the script will continue to add 2 to the previous value of 'i', till it exceeds 15.
And we get the total value in sum as  56.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learned two different syntax of for loop  and we also learned about the while loop.
As an assignment -find the sum of the first "n" prime numbers.
It summarizes the Spoken-Tutorial project.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Create and Edit Components in CellDesigner.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: open an already saved '.xml' file in the draw area,
change the following in a compartment: shape, size, color and thickness of the border,
create multiple files in CellDesigner, change identity of a Species.
We will also learn how to cut, copy and paste a Species, about Start-point and End-point of a Species,
how to activate and change color of a Species, change properties of a  Reaction , how to close a File.
Here I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 14.04, CellDesigner version 4.3, Java version 1.7.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with  undergraduate Biochemistry and CellDesigner interface.
If not, for relevant CellDesigner tutorials, please visit our website www.spoken-tutorial.org.
Learners please note: some of the previous tutorials in this series, were created on Windows OS.
However, hereon the series will be completed on Ubuntu Linux OS.
Let's proceed to create and edit components in CellDesigner.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously.
Now type ./runCellDesigner4.3 and press Enter.
CellDesigner window now opens on your screen.
Let us open the file Create and Edit that we had created earlier.
So, click on File and then on Open.
A dialog box named Open appears on the screen.
Here, we have to select the folder under ‘Folders’ label.
Click on the 'Create_and_Edit.xml' file under the ‘File’ label and then double-click on ‘Ok’.
Our file Create_and_Edit.xml is now open in the draw area.
Select the compartment. Go to the Component in the  main menu  bar.
Scroll down and select Change to OVAL.
On the draw area, we now have an oval compartment.
To change the color or thickness, go to “Component” in the main menu bar.
Click on “Change color & shape” option.
Alternately, right-click on the compartment boundary and select “Change color & shape” option.
A dialog box named 'Change color & shape' appears on the screen.
For a thinner boundary line, change the Membrane Thickness from 12 to 8 or below.
To change the color, go to Color panel.
In the Color panel is a color wheel, with a pointer like handle.
Click and hold the pointer and rotate to select the preferred color.
After all the modifications are done, click on Apply, and then on 'Ok'.
Explore other options to draw various Compartments on the reaction toolbar, on your own.
We will now learn how to change the identity of  Species.
So, first we will open a new window by pressing CTRL+N.
Let us give a name to this file, say Change Species.
We will keep the default width and height and click on Ok button.
Now, click on the icon for 'Generic protein' from the toolbar. Click on the draw area.
In the dialog box, type Pectin and click on the Ok button.
Now right-click on the Generic protein Pectin
and click on the option Change Identity.
A dialog box named 'Change identity of the species' appears on the screen.
Click on the down arrow in the Class box.
Select any option, for example, say simple molecule, from the drop-down menu.
Now, give a name to this simple molecule in the Name box.
Let's say Fructose and click on Apply button.
Observe that our Protein Pectin is now converted to a simple molecule named Fructose.
Let us now learn to Cut, Copy and Paste.
I will use the same Fructose that is already present on the draw area.
To cut a Species, click on the Species Fructose first.
Go to Edit menu, scroll down and click on Cut.
Notice here that the shortcut key for Cut is Ctrl+X.
The Species Fructose has been cut.
To paste the species, go back to the 'Edit' menu, scroll down and click on Paste.
Notice here that the shortcut key for Paste is Ctrl+V.
The Species Fructose reappears on the draw area.
To make a copy of the Species, go to  Edit on the main menu bar.
Click on Copy.
Notice here that the shortcut key for Copy is Ctrl+C.  Click on Copy. Click on the draw area.
This time, let us press Ctrl + V to paste.
We now have a copy of Fructose on the draw area.
To undo any action, press Ctrl+Z and to redo any action, press Ctrl+Y.
These are however, limited in their use.
Let us drag and move the Fructose molecules aside on the draw area.
To do so, click on Fructose and drag it to the desired location.
Next we will learn,  what are start-point and end-point species and how to activate a species?
For that, I have already drawn a state transition reaction between 2 generic proteins.
I have named them Protein 1 and Protein 2.
Recall, we already learnt how to draw a reaction earlier.
If you do not know, refer to the previous tutorials in this series. Let us proceed.
In this reaction,  the ‘start point’ is ‘Protein 1’  and the ‘end point’ is Protein 2.
To activate a species, click on a Species which is an 'end-point' of a Reaction.
In our case, it is Protein 2.
So, click on  Protein 2 and press A on the keyboard.
Let me undo this change by pressing Ctrl + Z keys.
Alternately, click on Protein 2
Next, on the main menu bar, go to Component.
Scroll down and click on Set Active.
Notice that the activated species is wrapped by a dashed line.
Let us now change the color of the species, Protein 2.
So, right-click on it and then click on 'Change color and shape'.
As we saw earlier, in the Color panel is the color wheel.
Click and rotate the pointer, to select the preferred color.
Then, click on Apply and Ok.
Observe the color changes in the  species.
We will now learn how to change the properties of a Reaction.
Let us come back to our state transition reaction present on the draw area.
Right-click on the reaction arrow between the two species.
Now, select Change Identity option.
A dialog box Change Properties of the Reaction appears.
Type the name of the reaction in the Name box, say Reaction1.
Select the required reaction from the drop-down menu in the Type box, say Transcription, Click on 'Ok'.
Observe that the reaction has changed on the draw area.
We do not see the name that we gave on the reaction arrow in the draw area.
Don't worry, we will learn about it in upcoming tutorials.
Let's right-click once again on the reaction arrow and click on Change Identity option.
In case it is a Reversible reaction, select the option TRUE and click on Ok.
You will now see that the reaction has reversed.
To exit CellDesigner, click on File and select Exit option.
Alternately, you may press Ctrl Q.
A dialog box Confirmation appears on the screen asking if we wish to save the changes.
Click Yes and double-click on the Ok button.
It says the file has been modified.
Save the changes?  Click Yes.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating Dummy Content.
In this tutorial, we will learn to create dummy content using devel module.
One of the things we need when we are building our Drupal site is to have a lot of content. This will help us to understand layouts, views and designs.
But ideally, we shouldn’t use real content. Say, we need to change a Content type, or a field.
The problem is we have to go in and edit the real content which is a waste of time.
But this step is very important. We need to test our content types to make sure they are working what we want.
We have only covered a few kinds of fields till now.
Here is our Cincinnati node. Let’s say the Cincinnati group wants to charge a fee for their meetings
and they want to put this on the site.
We can use a decimal for money or an integer which is a whole number.
Say, you chose an integer because they only charged 10 dollars. But later on, they decided to charge 10.99 dollars.
Then, we are in trouble.
An integer cannot be changed into a decimal, especially after we have already added content.
And so, these are the things that need to be planned out beforehand.
We can test all of this by using some fake content. These can be easily inserted and easily deleted, when we are done with our testing.
Remember this - we don’t need hundreds of real contents but only a few fake contents.
The solution to this problem is the Devel module. Go to drupal.org/project/devel.
Till now, we haven’t actually talked about Modules or extended our Drupal website yet. We will do that in the upcoming tutorials.
But here, we will learn to install Devel Module and use it. This will give us an idea of some of the power that Drupal Modules can give us.
Scroll down to the bottom and locate the Download section. This screen might look very different for you.
Drupal 8 dot x version could be up in the green region. So, make sure you click that one.
If not, then click the Development releases.
Now, there are two ways to do this. We can download it, but that will give us many unnecessary files on our desktop.
Or, we can right-click. And depending on our browser, we will see either Copy Link or Copy Link Location.
Either way, click the link to the .tar file or the .zip file. But don’t click on this dev file, because that won’t work.
These are the links to the actual files.
Once we have got that, come back to our site. Click on Extend and then on Install new module.
Now, paste the URL into the Install from a URL field. If you have a good internet connection, you can install from the URL.
Otherwise, for your convenience, the devel package has been provided in the Code Files link on this page.
Please download it and upload it using the Choose File option here. Lastly, click Install.
Now, click on Enable newly added modules.
Click on the word CORE to minimize it. Then scroll down.
Under the DEVELOPMENT block, we can see Devel and Devel generate. Ignore the others, for now.
Put a check-mark in Devel and Devel generate. Then, scroll down to the bottom and click Install.
Remember that in Drupal, we always have to make sure that we click on Save, Install etc.
We should get a green message here –"2 modules have been enabled".
Don’t worry if you see any caution message in red color, as long as it’s not a serious error.
To generate a whole bunch of content, click on Configuration. Then on the left hand side, we will see Generate content link. Click on that.
Now, we will be able to generate as much content as we want, to do the required testing.
We will choose Events and User Groups because these are the 2 Content types that we need to test.
Notice here, there is a "Delete all content in these content types before generating new content". This is to delete the fake content.
Let’s put a check mark there and generate 0 (zero) nodes. This will delete all the Events and User Groups.
This will also include the ones that we created ourselves. For example - our Cincinnati User Group would also be gone if we did this.
So, let’s uncheck that. Let’s generate 50 nodes.
Go back a year.
We don’t have comments on our nodes.
Change the Maximum number of words in titles to 2. If you don’t do that, this will generate a lot of long Lorem Ipsum text.
Click Generate. Immediately, we get a success message. To find out if it worked, click on Content.
Here’s a list of 50 new nodes - half Events and half User groups.
Click on any one and we will see that Devel has generated - a lot of text in Description, an Event Logo,
a fake Event Website, a Date, has chosen one of the User Groups as Sponsor and has selected some of the Event Topics.
We can now do our layouts, our views and all the other things that we need to do with our site.
Devel has helped us to save a lot of time by generating fake content.
This is a great feature of Drupal, provided from a Module, downloaded at drupal.org. These are called Contributed Modules. We will learn about this later.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial we have learnt about creating dummy contents using devel module.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installation of PostgreSQL.
In this tutorial, we will learn to install PostgreSQL on  Ubuntu Linux OS and  Windows operating system.
We will also learn to connect to PostgreSQL database and set password for the database.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with either of the mentioned operating system
PostgreSQL is a relational database management software.
It is a powerful and most advanced open source database system.
It runs on various platforms such as Linux, Windows and Mac Operating System.
First we will see how to install PostgreSQL on Linux.
Press CTRL + ALT +T keys simultaneously to open the terminal.
In the terminal window, type: sudo apt hyphen get update and press Enter.
This command will update the Ubuntu's default repositories.
Press Ctrl L to clear the screen.
Next, type: sudo apt hyphen get install postgresql and press Enter.
We can see the installation process has begun.
Press 'Y' wherever there is a prompt to confirm the configuration.
Installation will take sometime to complete, depending upon your internet speed.
Now we can see that the installation has been completed successfully.
By default, a user account called postgres is created during installation.
To set the password, type: sudo hyphen u postgres psql postgres and press Enter.
Enter your system password if prompted.
At the prompt, type: slash password postgres.
Immediately you will be prompted to set a new password for the Postgres user.
You can enter a password of your choice.
Enter the same password one more time.
Please remember this password for future use.
Next, type: select version open bracket close bracket semicolon and press Enter.
Do not forget to put the semicolon at the end of each statement.
The PostgreSQL version that we have installed now, is displayed on the terminal.
This indicates that we have successfully installed PostgreSQL.
I have increased the terminal font size for this demo.
So, I’ll hit the ‘q’ key to exit.
Now let us see how to disconnect from the server.
Type slash q and press Enter to disconnect from the server.
Notice that we are back at the command prompt of the terminal.
Every time when you want to work with PostgreSQL, you need to be connected to the server.
Psql is an interactive terminal program provided by PostgreSQL.
Using psql tool, we can execute SQL statements, manage database objects etc.
Another way to connect to a database is using pgAdmin GUI application.
We can interact with PostgreSQL database server through this interface.
We will be demonstrating all features using pgAdmin in this series.
Switch back to terminal.
For this, type: sudo psql hyphen capital U postgres hyphen h localhost hyphen capital W
hyphen h is the hostname or IP of the local server.
Enter the password for postgres user which you have set after installation.
We can see the prompt changes to Postgres.
Let us verify the PostgreSQL database and whether the server has been started by a simple query.
Type: Select current underscore user, now();
We can see the user name and current date as output.
During installation, some sample databases are created automatically.
Type: slash list or slash l and press Enter.
We can see the below database names that are available in PostgreSQL server, by default.
To change a database', type: slash c database name.
I will type:  slash c postgres.
We can see a message saying You are now connected to database “postgres” as user “postgres”.
We can create our own database and tables as per our requirement.
All the database commands can be executed from the command line.
Type: 'slash q' to disconnect from the server.
Now let us see how to install PgAdmin.
PgAdmin can be installed by using any one of the following methods on Ubuntu Linux Operating System.
Go to Ubuntu Software Centre or Synaptic Package manager, search for PgAdmin and install.
For more details, refer to the ‘Linux’ spoken tutorials on our website.
Or, in the Terminal, type:  sudo apt hyphen get install pgadmin3 and press Enter.
I have already installed PgAdmin in my machine.
Click Dash Home on the top left corner of the desktop.
In the Search box, type: PgAdmin.
The PgAdmin icon appears. Click on it.
The PgAdmin interface opens.
Now let us learn to install PostgreSQL on Windows OS.
Open your web browser and go to www.postgresql.org/download
Then, click on the Download the graphical installer link.
I have installed postgres version 9.3.x in Linux Operating System.
Now I would like to install the same version in Windows also.
So, click on the Previous supported versions and look for version 9.3.x
Click the link near to the Windows icon.
It will open a dialog box to save the file.
It will take sometime to download the file. Wait until it is finished.
I have already downloaded it in my machine in the Downloads folder.
Go to the Downloads folder and double-click on the downloaded file. It will open a window.
Click on the Run button.
In the setup window, click on the Next button.
Select the components and click on the Next button.
Enter the password for postgres and re-type one more time. Click on the Next button.
Installation has started. Wait until it finishes completely.
Next, click on the Finish button to complete the installation.
Lastly, exit from the wizard.
Let us see how to open the PostgreSQL command line on Windows.
Click on Start, then All program, then PostgreSQL and psql to open the command line.
We can see the postgres prompt.
Type: select version() semicolon and press Enter to see the installed version of postgresql.
This indicates that we have successfully installed in Windows.
Let us open the PgAdmin from Windows.
Click on Start, then All program, then PostgreSQL and PgAdmin3 to open the GUI interface.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu Linux and Windows operating systems.
As an assignment, connect to the server and list the default available database.

Toggle between the two windows by clicking the lightning bolt icon.
Let me now go back to graphics window.
Many tasks in Chimera can be accomplished by two methods.
First one, by making use of menu bar, located at the top of the Chimera window.
Other is by entering commands on the command line.
To show the command line, click on Favorites menu.
Scroll down and click on command line option.
A command dialog box appears at the bottom of the Chimera window.
Commands for a particular task are to be written in the text box.
We will learn more about this feature in the subsequent tutorials.
To resize the window, drag any corner of the window.
Now, let us see how to open a protein structure.
There are 3 ways you can do it. If you are connected to Internet, click on the File menu.
Scroll down and click on “Fetch by ID” option.
A dialog box appears on the screen.
You can connect to various databases to fetch the structure.
For demonstration, I wish to display a protein structure.
I will select PDB from the options.  Type the 4 letter PDB code of the protein molecule you intend to display.
I will type 1zik (one z i k).
This is the pdb code for Leucine zipper protein. Click on Fetch button.
By default, a ribbons display of the protein will appear on the display window.
We can also type a command to fetch a structure.
In the command line text box, type “open 1zik”.
Press Enter to open the structure on the display window.
If you are not connected to internet, you can open the already downloaded pdb file.
To clear the structure present on the screen: scroll down the Favorites menu and click on Model Panel option.
A Model Panel dialog box opens.
Click on model id, then click on Close option.
Now I will demonstrate how to download a PDB file.
You need a working internet connection to download the pdb file.
Scroll down the File menu and click on Fetch by ID option.
A dialog box opens.
Scroll down to bottom of the dialog box.
Click on web page button.
PDB database web page opens in the browser.
If you know the pdb code for the protein, type in the text box provided. Or, type the name of the protein.
I know the pdb code for leucine zipper. So, I will type “1zik” in the text box.
Click on Go button.
Scroll down the page.
Click on the Download files button located on the right-hand corner of the page.
From the drop-down menu click on PDB-file-text option.
A dialog box appears.
Click on Save File option.
Click on Ok button.
The downloaded pdb file will now be saved in the Downloads folder.
To open the already downloaded pdb file, click on Open option in File.
Navigate to the Downloads folder. Select 1zik.pdb file.
Click on “Open” button.
A model of leucine zipper is displayed on the panel.
By default, the two peptide chains are displayed as grey ribbons.
Use the mouse button to move the structure on the panel.
Left mouse button for rotation,
the middle mouse button controls xy translation.
The right button or the mouse wheel to zoom in or zoom out.
For interactive scaling and clipping of the structure:  use Side View option from Favorites menu.
A viewing window opens.
A tiny version of the structure is shown on the window.
The yellow square on the left, represents the viewer's eye position
Try moving the small square using left mouse button.
Dragging it horizontally, adjust the scale factor.
Double-clicking the eye position shows a menu for changing the camera mode.
Move the clipping planes i.e. the two vertical lines using left mouse button.
There are more viewing controls on the window which you can explore.
Close the viewing window.
Let us now learn to manipulate this structure.
The first step is to select the part of the structure you want to modify.
For now, I want to show the entire protein structure as atoms.
Click on the Select menu in the menu bar.
Select menu in the menu bar will allow us to select individual components of the structure
such as chain, element, residue, ligand etc.
However, if nothing is selected from the “Select” menu, it means we want to modify the entire structure.
Now go to Actions menu, and select atoms/bonds from the options.
Click on show from the sub-menu.
On the screen, we see atoms as well as part of the structure as ribbons.
Now to remove ribbons, select ribbons from the Action menu.
Then click on hide option.
The entire structure is now shown as sticks display.
Let us now proceed with a bit more manipulation of the structure.
The following steps will convert it to the ball and stick display.
Scroll down to atoms/bonds.
Select ball and stick from the sub-menu.
Notice that the structure is without hydrogen atoms.
To add hydrogen atoms, scroll down the Tools menu.
Click on Structure Editing.
From the sub-menu, select Add hydrogens option.
In the dialog box, make selections as shown.
Observe that the structure is now shown with hydrogen atoms.
Usually the structure of a protein is associated with water molecules.
To hide water molecules, go to Select menu, scroll down to Residue, click on HOH option.
Observe the screen; all the water molecules are highlighted.
Go to actions menu, scroll down to Atoms\bonds and click on hide option.
This will hide the water molecules from the structure.
The Presets option in the menu bar has some more options to change the display.
When you click on Interactive 1 option: the structure will be displayed as ribbons and both the peptide chains in different color.
Interactive 2 will convert the structure to atoms display.
Go back to Interactive 1 display.
We can also selectively change the color of peptide chains.
Scroll down the Select menu and select chain A from the sub-menu.
Chain A is now highlighted.
Go to Actions menu scroll down to color, select yellow.
Chain A is now displayed in yellow color.
To clear the selection, hold CTRL key on the key board. And click on the empty space on the Chimera window.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.
To exit the Chimera window, go to File menu and click on Quit option.
Let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to" open a structure on the Chimera window and download the PDB file for protein structures,
move, rotate and zoom the structure,  Scale and clip,
change the display using menus in the menu bar,
remove the water molecules, and  add hydrogens.
For the Assignment, download the pdb file of Leucine zipper from PDB database.
Open the pdb file on Chimera window using Open option in the File menu.
Change the display of atoms to wire and all the aromatic rings as disks.
Your completed assignment will look as follows.

Hello everybody.Welcome to this tutorial on Grammar of TurtleScript in KTurtle.
grammar of Turtle script  and  'if'-'else' condition.
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website:
Click on Dash home.
In the Search bar, type: "kturtle".
Click on the KTurtle icon.
We can also open KTurtle  using Terminal.
Press Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously to open the Terminal.
Type kturtle  and press Enter to open the 'KTurtle' Application.
Let's first look at TurtleScript.
TurtleScript is a programming language.
It has different types of words and symbols used for various purposes.
It instructs Turtle what to do.
Grammar of TurtleScript in  KTurtle includes-
Comments, Commands
Numbers, Strings
Variables and
Boolean values.
Now, we will see where to store numbers.
Numbers  can be stored in:
Mathematical operators
Comparison operators and
Variables,I will zoom the program text for clear view.
First  let's look at variables.
Variables are words that start with  ‘$’ sign, for example $a.
Variables are highlighted in purple color.
Using the assignment equal to (=), a variable is given its contents.
Variables can contain- * numbers $a=100.
strings $a=hello or
boolean values that is true or false $a=true.
Variable keeps the contents until program finishes execution or until it is reassigned to something else.
For example, consider the code.
Let us type:$a = 2004
$b = 25
print $a + $b
Variable 'a' is assigned a  value  2004.
Variable 'b' is assigned a value 25.
print command, commands Turtle to write something on the canvas.
print  command takes numbers and strings as input.
print $a + $b  commands Turtle to add two values and display them on the canvas.
Let's Run the code in slow speed.
Value 2029 is displayed on the canvas.
Let us next see the mathematical operators.
Mathematical operators include -
I will clear the current code from the editor and type "clear" command and Run to clean the canvas.
I will explain the code now.
“reset” command sets Turtle to its default position.
canvassize 200,200 fixes the width and height of the canvas to 200 pixels each.
Value 1+1 is assigned to the variable $add.
Value 20-5 is assigned to the variable $subtract.
Value 15 * 2 is  assigned to the variable $multiply.
30/30 is assigned to the variable $divide.
go 10,10 commands  Turtle to go 10 pixels left of canvas and 10 pixels from top of canvas.
print command displays the variable on the canvas.
I will copy the code from text-editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Pause the tutorial here and type the program into your  KTurtle editor.
Let us click on Run button  to run the program.
Command which is getting executed is highlighted on the editor.
Turtle displays the values on the canvas at the specified positions.
Let us consider a simple example for using  comparison operator .
I will clear the current code from the editor. Type "clear" command and Run to clean the canvas.
I will  zoom the program text to have a clear view.
Let's type:
$answer = 10 > 3
print $answer
Here, 10 is compared to 3 with the greater than operator.
The result of this comparison, the boolean value 'true', is stored in the
variable $answer and the value 'true' is displayed on the canvas.
Let's run the code now.
Turtle displays Boolean value 'true' on the canvas.
Now,let's see how Strings work in this application-
Strings can be put in variables like numbers.
Strings cannot be used in mathematical or comparison operators.
Strings are highlighted in red color.
'KTurtle' identifies a line in double quotes as a string.
I will clear the current code from editor. Type "clear" command and Run to clean the canvas.
Now, I will explain about Boolean values.
There are only two boolean values: "true" and "false".
For example, let's type the code:
$answer = 7<5
print $answer.
The Boolean value 'false' is assigned to the  variable $answer  because 7 is greater than 5.
Let's Run the code now.
Turtle displays Boolean value "false" on the canvas.
Let's next learn about “if-else” conditon.
‘if’ condition is executed only if the boolean value evaluates ‘true’.
‘else’ condition is executed only if the ‘if’ condition is ‘false’.
I will clear the current code from editor. Type "clear" command and Run to clean the canvas.
I already have a code in a text file.
This code compares numbers 4 , 5 and 6 and displays the results accordingly on the canvas.
I will copy the code from text-editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Let's run the code now.
The Turtle has compared the values 4 and 5
and has displayed the result: "4 is smaller than 6" on the canvas.
Grammar of Turtle script  and
‘if-else’ condition.
Now, to the assignment part.
Solve an equation using:
if - else condition,
Mathematical  and comparison  operators.
Display the results using  “print” and “go” commands.
To solve the assignment-
choose any four random numbers,
multiply two sets of random numbers,
compare the results using the comparison operators,
display both the results,
display greater result at the  center of the canvas.
You can choose any equation which you like.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Calling methods of the super class.
In this tutorial, we will learn:   when to use the super keyword
How to call methods of the super class
How to invoke the constructor of the super class.
Here we are using: Ubuntu Version 12.04 ,JDK 1.7 ,Eclipse 4.3.1
You must also have knowledge of subclassing and method overriding in Java.
A subclass can use a superclass data or method using the super keyword.
The super keyword :
Now, let us go to the IDE and to the project we created earlier.
Let us go to the Manager class.
Now, come to the getDetails() method.
In the return statement, let us remove Name and Email.
Now, let us come to the Employee class.
This is the parent class or super class.
We already have a getDetails() method here.
This method returns the name and email.
So, we can use this getDetails() method in the Manager class.
We will call getDetails() method from the Employee class, inside the Manager class.
So, come to the getDetails() method  in the manager class.
Inside the return statement, type: super dot getDetails() plus slash n Manager of  getDepartment().
Now, let me run the program.
We can see that we get the Manager details. Thus we can call the method of superclass inside the subclass.
Now let us come to the  Employee class.
Let us include a constructor here.
So, inside the Employee class, type:  public space Employee  within brackets String name, String email_address .
Within curly brackets, type: this dot name is equal to name semicolon , this dot email_address is equal to email_address
Now, let us comment the setter and getter methods.
Inside the getDetails() method-  instead of getName, type name , instead of getEmail, type email_address.
A subclass inherits all of the methods and variables from a parent class.
Note that it does not inherit constructors.
But, constructors can call the non-private constructors of its superclass.
We do this using the keyword super from the child class constructor.
We will see that now.
For that, come to the Manager class. We will include a constructor here.
So, type: public space Manager within brackets String space  name comma String space email underscore address comma String space dept .
Then, within curly brackets, type: super within brackets name, email underscore address semicolon.
Then type: department is equal to dept semicolon.
Here we will comment the setter and getter methods.
Then, in the getDetails() method type: department instead of getDepartment.
Now, come to the TestEmployee class.
Comment the call to the setter methods.
Now, inside the call to the Manager constructor, type: within quotes Nikkita Dinesh,  abc@gmail.com, Accounts.
Now, run the program.
We get the output as shown. We get the Manager details.
In this way, we can call the constructor of the super class.
In this tutorial, we have learnt: the super keyword  ,calling the method of the super class and  invoking constructor of super class.
As an Assignment-Open the previous assignment. Call the Vehicle class run method in the Bike class.
The output should be: The Vehicle is running. The Bike is running safely.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Overview of Linux AWK commands.
In this tutorial, we will learn about Linux AWK and the tutorials covered in the Linux AWK series.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System.
AWK is used for searching and extracting data from a file.
We can also manipulate the data and generate reports using AWK.
Like any programming language, AWK also has-
conditional Statements,
single and multi dimensional arrays,
During the search process, a file will be treated as a sequence of records.
Each line will be considered as a single record with multiple fields.
Then AWK searches for the given pattern and performs the desired action.
Now, we will briefly go through some of the individual AWK tutorials in this series.

Please do not post unrelated and general questions on them.
This is Praveen from IIT Bombay, signing off. Thank you for joining.
Welcome to this tutorial on user login and sessions.
This tutorial will give a few aspects of php that will focus on how an html form can be submitted and how to check for user name and password.
The entered values will be checked against a database.
I'll show you how to set-up a database with your 'user name' and password, how to connect to a database and also to process a logout function.
Since we're using sessions, the user will remain logged-in until they press the logout button.
To start with I'll create an html form.
I'll take you through some of the MySQL features that we will set up.
In our html form, we have the action going to a page called "login dot php".
We'll keep separate pages to keep it simple.
Our method is going to be "POST". Let's end our form here.
I'll start creating our input type which will be "text" and the name will be "username".
A 'line-break' here.
Copy-paste this line and change "text" to "password".
And it's called "password".  Depending on which operating system we are using, this will appear as stars or circles.
And finally we'll create a "submit" button and its value will be "Log in".
Let's try this. Refresh and we have a page here.
"index dot php" with a user name and password.
I'll log in and it goes to a page that doesn't exist.
Now, let's make it a bit more user friendly and type out labels here.
Refresh and there we are.
Now let us create our "login dot php" file.
First I will open "php my admin".
If you are using "xampp" then it will be installed by default using the local host for "php my admin".
If it isn't installed yet, I would suggest you google it and install a copy on the local host directory and start using it.
Now, we'll create a new database.
So here, create new database called "php login" and click Create.
We can see it appears here and we can now create tables.
In case you're not familiar with sql, let me brief you.
A basic structure is a database which stores tables,  tables store rows and rows store values.
Let's name it "users" and click on OK.
An error - the "Number of fields"!
When I create a new database, I open up a notepad  and note down all the fields that I'll use.
I'll use "id" for start, next "user name" and lastly "password". That's all we want at the moment.
We can also add the "first name", "date of birth" etc. depending on your program.
But for now, we're using these 3 fields making it a total of 3 fields.
Let's go back here. So, three fields and that will create that first.
Now we proceed with typing in the the field names.
We type "id" and we will make this an integer.
This is the primary key and we want it to make auto_increment.
Now, every time a new record is created, the "id" values will increment by one.
So, for example, the first user who registers will have an "id" of one, the second user who registers will have an "id" of two and so on and so forth.
Okay, next one will be the "user name" and last one is going to be the "password".
Next, we'll set them as VARCHARs and I'll set this as 25 characters and the password as 25 characters, as well.
There is nothing else that we need to set for these.
Let us scroll down and let's click on Save.
Okay, so once I save here, we can come down and see this here.
And you can insert values in them.
We'll do it because we're testing.
I have created some tutorials on how to make a user registration form. We can discuss this further there.
The value of "id" will be auto-incremented, so we don't have to put anything.
It'll go to 1 straight away.
In user name, I'll say "Alex".
My password will be "abc".  I would recommend you a better password, though.
Okay, so user name is "Alex" and password is "abc" - easy to remember. That's what has been stored.
To browse, just click the Browse tab.
Let's scroll down. We have "user name" and "password" as "Alex" and "abc" and the "id" has already been set to 1.
Now, we'll create the "login dot php" page.
Let's save this quickly - "login dot php".
Let us see how to create our php tags.
I'll take into account some POST variables now.
In "index dot php", we used the method as "POST".
We'll set '$username' as 'dollar sign underscore POST' and rename the variable which is "username".
It is found here and.... $password will equal a POST value and that will be "password".
First of all, we will check whether both the username and the password were entered.
We won't start validating the form. Its unnecessary to do so since we know the user has entered both these fields.
Now, I will type my if statement.
This will be a big block because all the code that I require after I check this will go in here.
So, here I'll say if "$username" which means if "username" has a value, it will return TRUE and I'll say "$password".
So this requires the "username" and "password" for this to be TRUE and to execute this block of code here.
What should we write here?  We need to connect to our database.
To do this, we create a variable called "$connect" equal to "mysql_connect()".
And inside this, the first parameter will be a "host" which is "localhost" for me.
The second one will be "username" and I'll use "root".
The third one is the "password" which I believe I don't have.  We'll check on that.
After this we can say "or die" and give an error message.
So, for example, we can say "Couldn't connect".
I am not sure about my password.  I think it's something else.
We'll try something, then it will say "Couldn't connect".
Now we need to select our table, sorry our database.
We'll say "mysql_select_db" which is another built-in function when you have the php module installed.
It also comes with XAMPP.
Here I'll put a double quote and say "phplogin"
So assuming that everything is okay, I can add my error message here "Couldn't find db". Okay?.
Refresh page.  Click Login.  Nothing happened.
Let's edit our "if" statement and say "else" echo or instead the best function is "die()".
Here it will just stop executing anything after this point, after this function is called.
And it'll also pass a message of your choice.
So here I'll say "Please enter a user name and a password".
Refresh this. Resend the data and we get this error message.
Next I'll type "Alex" and "123", sorry "abc" and click Login.
No error message which means we are connected to the database.
That's the end of this part.  In the next one I will show how to connect to our database and check for the username and password.
Thanks for joining us. This is Royston, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project. Bye.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Advanced Formatting and Password Protection in Calc.
Protect a spreadsheet with a password
Protect a single sheet with a password
Define Ranges for a database
Use the Subtotal option and  Validate cells.
Let us open our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
This file has been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Please download and extract the file. Make its copy and use it for practising.
First let us learn to protect this spreadsheet with a password.
This option ensures that only people who know the password can open this spreadsheet.
Click on the drop-down besides the Save icon and select Save As option.
Save As dialog box opens up.
Check the Save with password checkbox at the bottom left corner.
In the Save As option, we can either save it as a different file or replace the same file.
For this demonstration, we will replace the file.
Set Password dialog box opens up.
Here in the Enter password to open field, type a password, say spoken123.
In the Confirm password text field, retype the same password that is spoken123.
Then click on the OK button in the dialog box.
Close the file.
Now, we’ll try to reopen this file and check what happens.
Immediately the Enter Password dialog box appears.
Let us type the password as 111 here and click on the OK button.
We get an error message.
Click on the OK button.
This time in the Enter password field, type the correct password as spoken123.
The Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file opens.
It is possible for us to remove the password option at a later time, as well.
To do that, click on the drop-down besides the Save icon and then on the Save As option.
Now uncheck the Save with password option in the Save As dialog box.
Then click the Save button at the top right corner.
Let’s replace the same file by clicking on the Yes button.
Once again, let us close and open this file.
Notice that, this time we do not require a password to open the file.
Next, let’s learn how to password-protect individual sheets in the spreadsheet.
Go to the Tools menu in the menu bar and click on the Protect sheet option.
Alternatively, right click on the Sheet 1 tab at the bottom and select Protect Sheet option.
Either ways, the Protect Sheet dialog box opens.
To protect the sheet, uncheck the following options by clicking on the checkbox besides it:
Select protected cells and  Select unprotected cells.
Now, in the Password field, let’s type spoken123 as our password.
In the Confirm field, retype the same password.
Then click on the OK button in the dialog box.
We can see a lock symbol in the Sheet 1 tab.
This indicates that our sheet is now password-protected.
To verify, let’s try to add some data in any cell on this sheet.
Notice that we are unable to type anything in any cell.
Also, we see a warning message. Click Ok to exit this box.
We are also unable to select or move the image in this sheet elsewhere.
But what about the other sheets? Let’s click on Sheet 2.
Here we’ll select cell E3 and type the word testing inside the cell.
Calc allows us to edit the cells in other sheets.
Let’s undo these changes.
Now go back to Sheet 1.
Let’s unprotect the sheet now.
Right-click on Sheet 1 tab and select Protect sheet option.
The Unprotect Sheet dialog box opens up and prompts us for the password.
Type spoken123 in the password optional text field.
Click on the Ok button in the dialog box
Notice the lock symbol in Sheet 1 tab has disappeared now.
This indicates that Sheet 1 is no longer password
We are able to edit the cells again and move the images as well.
Next, let’s learn about Ranges.
We can define a range of cells in a spreadsheet and use it as a database.
Each row in this database range corresponds to a database record
While each cell in a row corresponds to a database field.
We can sort, group, search and perform calculations on the range as we would do in any database.
First, let’s define a database in our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods and then sort the data.
So, let’s select the items which we require in the database.
We’ll select all the data from column SN to Miscellaneous.
We’ll Ignore the Sum Total row for now.
Let’s name our database.
Go to the Data menu in the menu bar and select the Define Range option.
Define Database Range dialog box opens up.
In the Name field, type dtbs which is the short-form of the database.
Click on the OK button in the dialog box.
Click anywhere else in the spreadsheet to deselect the cells.
Again go to the Data menu in the menu bar and click on the Select Range option.
Select Database Range dialog box appears.
Notice that in the Ranges section, the name dtbs is listed as a database.
Click on dtbs from the list and then click on the OK button in the dialog box.
Now we can sort the data within this database, however we want.
Sorting data was already explained in an earlier tutorial in this series.
So, we’ll skip that demonstration here.
Next, let’s learn how to use the Subtotal option in Calc.
The Subtotals option calculates the sub total of data under different columns.
For this, we can use any mathematical function of our choice.
Let’s find the subtotals of the data in the Cost column.
First, let’s delete the entry in row number 8 which is SUM TOTAL.
Then select all the data from cell A1 to F7 as shown.
Go to the Data menu in the menu bar and click on the Subtotals option.
The Subtotals dialog box appears.
By default, the 1st Group tab is selected at the top.
Click the Group by field drop-down and choose SN, if not already selected.
This groups the data by SN which is the Serial Number.
Next, in the Calculate subtotals for field, check on the Cost checkbox.
This will calculate the total of all the entries under it.
Under the Use function field, choose Sum, if not already selected.
Notice that the Grand Sum of the entries under the column Costs is displayed on the spreadsheet.
We also see subtotals after every row and see the changes in the SN column.
Click on cell C14 and look at the formula bar.
We see the syntax of the formula, Calc has used for the SUBTOTAL.
It says equal to SUBTOTAL and within brackets number 9 and the cell range.
The same is seen highlighted in the spreadsheet as well.
Refer to this table for numbers that correspond to functions within the SUBTOTAL formula.
9 stands for the function SUM which is what we had selected in the SUBTOTAL dialog box.
Other function numbers are mentioned in this table, for your quick reference.
Use the corresponding numbers in the left column, when you wish to use another function.
At the top left below the Name Box, we can see 3 tiny new tabs 1, 2 and 3.
These tabs give 3 different views of the data.
Let’s click on tab 1.
Click on tab 2.
The data under Costs as well as the Grand Sum is displayed.
Now, click on tab 3.
We get the detailed view of all the data along with the Grand Sum of the data under Costs.
Let’s close this file without saving the changes.
And let’s re-open the file.
We’ll now learn about the Validity option in Calc.
The Validity option validates data in the spreadsheet.
This is done by specifying the Validation rules for the selected cells in the spreadsheet.
For example, we can specify the mode of payment for the items bought using Validation.
Let’s add a new column Mode of Payment as MOP next to the column Received.
Below the heading MOP, the cells can be used to display the mode of payments.
The MOP for the Items in Column B can be shown here.
That is, Salary, House Rent, Electricity Bill and the other components.
Now, let us click on the empty cell just below the heading MOP.
This will have the mode of payment for the item Salary.
Go to the Data menu in the menu bar and select Validity option.
The Validity dialog box pops up.
Let’s click the Criteria tab at the top if not already selected.
From the Allow field drop-down, select List.
The Entries box gets displayed.
Let’s enter the options which will appear on validating the selected cell.
We’ll type the first mode of payment as In Cash and press Enter.
Next, we’ll type the following entries as shown.
Click on the OK button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Notice the down arrow displayed alongside cell F2, which means the cell is validated.
Now, click the down arrow.
We see the options that we entered as Mode of Payments in the Entries box here.
Click on the down arrow again to collapse the list.
To validate the cells below, click on the Clone Formatting icon in the Standard toolbar.
Then, click on the cell F3 and press the left mouse button.
Drag along the cursor till cell F7 and release the mouse button.
All selected cells are validated in one go.
Now click on the cell just below the heading MOP and then click on the down arrow alongside.
For mode of payment let’s select Online.
In the same manner, you can select the options in each of the validated cells.
Select according to the mode of payment made for each Items as shown.
Likewise we can format and validate other columns in the spreadsheet.
Let’s save all these changes and close the file.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial, let us summarize.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Protect a single sheet with a password
Define Ranges for a database, Use the Subtotal option and  Validate cells.
As an assignment
Use the password protect option to protect the sheet named Department Sheet
Use the Subtotals option and find the Grand Sum of Salary column
Close the file without saving the changes.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on the Mozilla Firefox - Search and Auto-complete features.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Search, manage Search Engines, use the Find bar,
use Auto-complete in the Address bar.
In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04.
One of the most common things people do on the internet is to search for information.
One can search for a specific website or for some other information.
Mozilla Firefox has a number of functionalities that make it easy to search for information on the Internet.
Let’s look at some of the ways.
One way is to search by visiting other websites.
After all, search engines are websites too!
In the URL bar, type: ‘www.google.com’.
The google home page comes up.
In the search box  of the google home page, type: ‘email’ and click Search.
The search engine brings up all the results.
We see that the top result is for g mail, the email from 'google'.
But, there is an easier way to do the same thing with Mozilla Firefox.
Next to the 'URL bar' on the navigation toolbar, there is a Search bar field.
Alternately, you can press Ctrl+K to directly go to the Search bar  field.
Click on the search bar and type ‘email’.
Click the magnifying glass icon that is next to it.
We will see the results of the search in the contents area.
We see that the top result is for 'gmail', the email from 'google'.
On the left side of the 'Search bar', the logo of the search engine which has been used to bring up the results is seen.
The default search engine used in Mozilla Firefox is ‘google’.
But, we need not be constrained by this. We can choose the search engine of our choice.
Click on the google’s search engine logo within the Search bar.
We notice that a drop-down box appears with the logos of most popular search engines including “Yahoo” and “Bing”.
Select “Yahoo” from the drop-down box.
We observe that the logo on the left of the search bar has now changed to the “Yahoo” logo.
Now, let's  type ‘email’ again in the 'Search bar' and click the magnifying glass.
This time we see that the results in the Contents area are from the “Yahoo” search engine.
Observe that the results are slightly different from last time.
The top result is no longer 'gmail'. Instead, the top result is “Yahoo” mail.
Click on the search engine logo within the 'Search bar' again.
In the drop-down box,  select Manage Search Engines.
This opens a dialog box entitled ‘Manage Search Engine List'.
Click on the last item in the list.

Welcome to this  spoken tutorial on Logical Operators in Java.
In this tutorial, you will learn about the logical operators.
How to check for multiple expressions using logical operators and  how to override precedence using parentheses.
For this tutorial we are using:
To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge on relational operators in Java.
Logical operators are used to check for multiple conditions.
Here is a list of the available logical operators in Java.
and, or, not. We shall look into each of them in detail. Switch to Eclipse.
Here, we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and  the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class LogicalOperators and added the main method.
Let us create some variables.
boolean b ;
We shall store the result of conditions in 'b';
int age is equal to 11;
int weight is equal to 42;
We have the age and weight of a person.
We shall check if the person is below 18yrs of age and is at least 40kgs.
b is equal to age less than 18 ampersand ampersand weight greater than equal to 40;
This statement has two expressions and a double ampersand symbol in between.
It checks if age is less than 18 and also if weight is greater than or equal to 40.
This operation is called the and operation.
Let us now print the value of 'b'.
System dot out dot println(b);
Save and Run .
As we can see, the output is true because both the conditions are satisfied.
Now, let us change the weight so that one condition is not satisfied and re-run the code.
Change 42 to 32.
The output now is false.
This is because the condition age less than 18 is  satisfied
but the condition  weight  greater than or equal to 40 is not satisfied.
The AND operation requires both the conditions to be true for the result to be true.
Therefore we get false as our output.
This way, using a  double ampersand symbol we can perform  an AND operation.
Let's say we have age and weight and it is enough if only one of the conditions is satisfied.
In other words, we need to see if the first condition  or the second condition is true.
It is done using the OR operation.
Let us first remove the earlier condition.
And  type:
age less than or equal to 15 pipe pipe weight less than or equal to 30
There are two conditions and a double pipe symbol in between.
This statement checks if at least one of the given two conditions is satisfied.
Let us run the code to see the output. Save and run.
We see that the output is true.
This is because an OR operation does not need both the conditions to be true like the AND operation.
It needs at least one condition to be true.
So, although the condition for weight is not satisfied, since the condition for age is satisfied
we get the output as true.
Now, let us change the age in  such a way that both the conditions are false and see the result.
change 11 to 17.
Save and Run .
Now the output is false because both the conditions are not satisfied.
This way, we use a double PIPE symbol to do an OR operation.
Now, let us say we need to check for people who are older than 15 and with weight more than 30kilos.
In other words, we need to check the exact opposite of the condition we just did.
In such situations, we use the NOT operation.
First, enclose the condition in parentheses.
And  add an exclamation mark before the condition.
By using an exclamation mark, we check for the exact opposite of the condition inside the parentheses.
Since the earlier output was false, now it must be   true. Let us see.
As we can see, the output is the opposite of earlier one.
This way, by using the exclamation mark we perform the NOT operation. Now, let us say we want people  younger than 15.
Or people younger than 18  and  lighter than 40kilos.
Let us see how would we go about this condition.
Remove the earlier condition and type:
age less than 15
OR age less than 18
AND weight less than 40;
As we can see, the condition itself is confusing.
Moreover, we do not know if the OR operation will be performed first or the AND operation.
It depends on the precedence of operators.
In such situations, we use parentheses to overwrite the precedence and also make the condition clear.
So let us add the parentheses.
Let us run the code,  save, run.
Now, although the first condition which is age less than 15 is not satisfied,
the second condition which is
age less than 18 and weight less than 40 is satisfied.
Therefore, the output is true.
As a rule, use parentheses to avoid ambiguity and make the expressions clear.
And  this is how we use the logical operators to check for multiple conditions.
We have learnt about logical operators, how to check for multiple expressions using logical operators and
how to override the precedence using parentheses.
find out if the two expressions shown are equivalent?

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Switch Case in Java.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the switch case construct in Java.
For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0
For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of if else statement in Java.
If not, please go through the tutorials on these topics available at our website which is as shown
switch case: The switch case is used to perform actions based on the value of a variable.
Here is the syntax for a switch case statement.
Let us use it now.
I already have Eclipse opened.
I have created a class named SwitchCaseDemo.
Now, let us add some variables.
Inside the main method, we will create a variable day of type int.
So, type inside the main method int day and we can give it a value equal to 3 semicolon.
Now, let us create a variable dName of type String.
String dName we can initialize it to null.
Here, dName is a variable to hold the name of the days of a week.
day stores the day number.
Now, we will type the switch case statement. So, next line, type:
switch within brackets day then open curly brackets Press Enter.
This statement defines which variable is under consideration for the cases.
Next line, type:
case 0 colon.
Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Sunday semicolon.
Then type: Next line break;
This statement says that if the day is 0 then dName must be set to Sunday.
Note that a break statement must be used at the end of each case.
without the break statement, the switch-case functions in a complex fashion.
It will be explained in subsequent part of the tutorial.
Similarly, let us type the remaining cases.
Next line, type: case 1 colon.
Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Monday  semicolon.
Next line, type break;
Then type: case 2 colon.
Next line, dName equal to  Tuesday then semicolon.
Next line, type break;
Then next line, case 3 colon.
Next line, type: dName equal to within double quotes Wednesday  then semicolon
Next line, type break;
Then case 4 colon.
Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Thursday then semicolon.
Then break .
Then next line, type: case 5 colon.
dName equal to within double quotes Friday then semicolon.
Then break.
Then case 6 colon.
Next line, type: dName equal to within double quotes Saturday  then semicolon.
Then type: break semicolon.
Then close the brackets.
Now, let us add a print statement and see the code in action.
So, next line, type: System  dot out dot println within brackets dName  then semicolon.
Now Save and run the file.
Now press Ctrl S and Ctrl F11 keys.
We get the output as: Wednesday which is corresponding to the case 3.
Now, let us change the value of the  day and see the result.
So change 3 to 0.
Now Save and Run that file.
As we can see, the output is Sunday corresponding to the case 0.
Now, what if there is no case corresponding to the value. So, let us see that.
Change day equal to -1 Save and run the file.
As we can see, there is no output.
But it would be better if we could have a case for all other values.
That is done by using the default keyword.
So, after the last case, type:
default  colon.
Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Wrong Choice then semicolon.
Next line, break  semicolon.
We do not say case default;
Note that we simply use the keyword default.
Now, let us run the code. So save and run the file.
As we can see, the default case is executed and the required message Wrong choice is printed.
Let us try with another random value.
Change -1 to 15.
As we can see, again the default case is executed.
Now, let us see what happens if we remove the break statement.
So, Let us change day = 15 to day = 4,
remove the corresponding break statement for day =4.
Now Save and run the file.
Although the case is 4, we get the output as Friday and not Thursday.
This is because of the way switch case works.
First, the value of day is compared with 0.
Then with 1, then with 2 and so on with all the possible cases.
When a match is found, it executes all the case from the match onwards.
In our case, it executed case 5 after case 4.
Then it stops because of the break statement in case 5.
To avoid that, we need to add a break statement in each case.
Let us now add the break statement we have removed.
So, type: break semicolon.
Now let us run the code.
As we can see, now only case 4 is executed.
As a rule, remember to use a break statement in every case, to avoid errors.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to use switch case construct and how to use break statement.
As an assignment, write a program that has a name and gender as a variable. Use a switch case statement that prints “Hello Mr....” for males and “Hello Ms...” for females.

Hello friends. Welcome to the tutorial on plotting charts
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to
To practice this tutorial, you should know how to
Load data from files and Plot data.
Let us initialize the pylab package.
A pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors, to illustrate numerical proportion
The syntax for pie() function is as follows: pie inside parentheses values comma labels equal to labels
Where values are the data to be plotted and labels – the label for each wedge in the pie chart
Plot a pie chart representing the profit percentage of company A.
Use the data from file company-a-data.txt available in the code file link of this tutorial
The data file has two columns with a set of values in each column.
The first column represents years. The second column represents the profit percentages.
To produce a scatter plot, we first need to load the data from the file using loadtxt command.
Let us clear the terminal.
unpack equal to True --> returns the transposed array of data.
Type clf open and close parentheses to clear the plot window, if any plots executed previously.
Type pie(profit comma labels equal to year) and press Enter.
Notice that we passed two arguments to the function pie().
First one being the values, which is profit in our case.
The next one being the set of labels to be used in the pie chart, which is year in our case.
Pause the video here.
Plot a pie chart with the same data with the following colors for each wedges.
yellow, blue, green, cyan,
yellow, magenta and blue.
Hint: In your ipython interpreter, try typing pie question mark.
Solution to Exercise 2
Type pie inside parentheses profit comma labels equal to year comma colors equal to inside parentheses the color codes  and press Enter.
This will display a pie chart with each wedge having the color as specified in the parameters.
A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars
The syntax for bar chart is: bar inside parentheses x comma y
Plot a bar chart representing the profit percentage of company A.
Use the data from file company-a-data.txt.
Solution to Exercise 3
Type bar open and close parentheses year comma profit and press Enter.
This will display a bar chart representing the profit percentage of company A
Plot a bar chart as shown in the image:
The data for the chart may be obtained from the file company-a-data.txt.
Hint: In your ipython interpreter, try typing bar question mark
Solution to Exercise 4
Type bar open and close parentheses year comma profit comma fill equal to False comma hatch equal to inside single quotes slanting line and press Enter.
This will display a bar chart which is not filled and which is hatched with 45

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Menu and Endpoints.
In this tutorial, we will learn to set up URL patterns. We will also learn about Menu management.
In this tutorial, we will talk about the process of creating proper URL paths for our website.
Endpoints and aliases- Endpoints are URL paths which display a particular content.
By default, in Drupal, the endpoint of a node is node/[node:id].
Sending this to a server will display the contents of the node. A number in the ID is not human readable
that is, we cannot easily associate a particular content with say, node/278162
Alias is an alternate URL path for the same content. We can use either the original or any one of several aliases for displaying the same content.
For example, node/278162 and content/drupal-camp-mumbai-2015.
Both return the same content. The second one is easy to remember.
Let us now create URL patterns that will apply to all the contents we have.
Setting up URL paths require three modules.
Those three modules are the Pathauto, Token and CTools.
Please go ahead and get the Pathauto installed on your machine.
Come back to the Pathauto project page. Here, you will notice that Pathauto requires Token and CTools.
Install Token and CTools. Once you have installed these modules, turn them on.
Once we have done that, we are ready to go.
Click on Configuration. Down here, on the left hand side, under the SEARCH AND METADATA section, you will see URL aliases.
By default, there are no URL aliases available.
Click on the Patterns tab. Click on the Add Pathauto pattern button.
Click on the Pattern type drop-down.
Here we can create separate patterns for Forum, Content, Taxonomy term and User.
For example, I will select Content.
Template variables are called as tokens. They are dynamically generated for each entity.
Token module provides these variables. When you see Browse available tokens in any input form, you can insert predefined tokens.
Click on the Path pattern box where you want to insert a token.
Type "content/". Then click on the Browse available tokens link.
A popup window opens up to show the "Available tokens".
Suppose we want a pattern like content/[title of the page], the token for the title of the page is under the Nodes section.
Click on the right arrow button of the Nodes section.
Choose the token [node:title] which will be replaced by the Title of the page.
This will insert [node:title] at the cursor location in the form box.
If this does not happen, make sure to click on the box and position the cursor as required.
Under Content type, we can select to which entity type this pattern should be applied.
Let us select all the types so that this pattern is default for all of them.
This setting can also be overridden for a particular type.
In the Label field, type "Content Title". Then click on the Save button. Here, we can check the new pattern we just created.
This pattern will be applied to generate URL aliases for all newly added contents. But it will not create the URL aliases for existing contents.
To apply it for the existing contents, click on the Bulk generate tab. Select Content type and click on the Update button.
It is started generating the URL aliases. It can take a while depending on the number of existing contents.
Now click on the List tab. We can see that the URL aliases for our content.
Each node on our site has a system path of /node/nodeid.
The newly generated URL alias is there in the first Alias column.
We can see that all the aliases follow the same pattern. You have to do this each time you create a new Content type.
Use the following thumb rules to create patterns-
Separate words by hyphen and not underscore
Use date tokens for contents classified by time.
There are more options available to control the URL alias pattern in the Settings tab.
We also see that, by default, several common words are removed from the pattern.
To summarize -
delete aliases and bulk generate aliases at any time.
From now onwards, every new node will use the patterns that we have established.
Now, we will talk about the Menus.
We have been adding menus to our site, in a random order, mostly based on the Views and basic pages.
Now, let’s see how we can manage the menu system.
Go to Structure, scroll down and click on Menus.
We have a number of different menus here that come with Drupal, by default.
We are interested in the Main navigation menu. So, click on Edit menu.
Here, we will be able to click and drag and re-order our Menu links.
Let’s drag Home and Upcoming Events to the top.
You can re-order these, in any way you want. Once done, click Save.
Now we have got Events and Upcoming Events.
This will create a sub menu.
That’s pretty simple. Click Save and take a look at our front page.
Notice that now we have got four menus.
Where did our 'Event' sub-menu go?
Please remember, not all themes in  Drupal support sub-menus or drop-down menus. 'Bartick theme is one of them.
For now, go back to Structure > Menus and edit the Main menu.
What if we need a link to a particular node or to a particular section of our site?
For instance, if I wanted a menu link for my Forums, I would first go back to the site.
Go to the Forums page and copy the actual URL which is just /forum.
Then come back over and click on Edit menu and then on Add link.
Give it a title called "Forum" and paste the copied link.
If you are looking for a specific piece of content, just type a letter like ' F'  or 'G'.
Say, for instance, if we type an 'a' , all the nodes that have 'a' in the title, will show up.
We can just select the one we are looking for and it will tell us that its node id number 1.
If we want an internal path, such as the ability to add a node, then it would be /node/add.
If we want to link it to the Homepage, it will be front.
Click Save and now we have a link to the Forum.
Click Save. Let’s just double check if that works and indeed it does!
So, play around a little bit to understand it better.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt about:

Press Ctrl+Z keys on the keyboard to undo.
In this spreadsheet, we had already typed the column headings earlier.
In Calc, we can differentiate the headings from other data by adding a style to it.
To do that, click on cell A1.Then hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor upto cell G1.
Now release the left mouse button.
We can see that all the headings got highlighted.
Now click on Styles menu in the menu bar.
We can see various heading styles.
Now click randomly on any cell to unselect the headings.
Notice that the headings are now highlighted with a grey colour background.
In the Items column, we’ll type the names of a few items one below the other.
In order to enter numbers in the cell, click on the cell and type the number.
Remember to always press the Enter key after every data-entry.
To enter a negative number, either type a minus sign before it or enclose it within parentheses.
By default, numbers are right-aligned and negative numbers have a leading minus symbol.
Let us delete these entries.
Select all the cells to be deleted by holding the Shift key and clicking each cell.
In the SN column, we want the serial number of each item one below the other.
So click on cell A2 and enter numbers as 1, 2, 3 one below the other.
Remember to press Enter key after typing each number.
In order to auto-fill the serial numbers in the subsequent cells, click on the cell A4.
Click on a little black box that is visible at the bottom-right corner of the cell.
Drag it till cell A7 and release the mouse button.
We see that cells A5, A6 and A7 get auto-populated with the subsequent serial numbers.
We will now enter the cost of each item under the heading Cost.
Click on the cell C3 and type the expense for House rent as Rupees 6000.00
Now, what if we want the number with the Rupee symbol?
Clear the value typed in cell C3 by pressing Ctrl and Z keys together.
Right-click on the cell C3 and  select the Format Cells option.
This will open the Format Cells dialog box.
The first tab is Numbers. Click on it if not already selected.

Welcome to this tutorial on Aesthetic Mapping in ggplot2.
In this tutorial, we will learn,
What is aesthetic
How to create plots using aesthetic
Tuning parameters in aesthetic
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Basics of statistics
Basics of ggplot2 package
Data frames
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A data frame moviesData.csv, and
A script file aesPlots.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to aesPlots folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have set aesPlots folder as my Working Directory.
Now let us see what is Aesthetic?
Aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in a plot.
It includes lines, points, symbols, colors, and position.
It is used to add customization to our plots.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script aesPlots.R in RStudio.
Here, we are plotting a scatter plot between critics_score and audience_score of movies.
Run this script by clicking on the Source button.
Scatter plot appears in the Plots window.
movies data frame opens in the Source window.
In this scatter plot, each point refers to a particular movie.
Suppose we want to color these points according to the genre of the movies.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
As we can see that there are different genres like
Drama
Comedy
Horror
Documentary, etc.
So, we will assign a unique color to each genre.
Click on the script aesPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Inside aes, we have added color argument and set it to genre.
Save the script and run the current line by pressing Ctrl+ Enter keys simultaneously.
Modified scatter plot appears in the Plots window.
In the Plots window, click on the Zoom button to maximize the plot.
We can see that each point is assigned a unique color according to its genre.
In the right side of the plot, we can view the mapping of genres with their colors.
Close this plot.
Now, we will learn how to draw a bar chart using ggplot function.
In the Source window, click on movies.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
Let us inspect the object named mpaa underscore rating in movies.
Click on the script aesPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Run the last two lines of code.
mpaa_rating is a factor.
It has 6 levels like
G NC-17 PG PG-13 R, and  Unrated.
So, our bar chart will have 6 different bars.
Each bar will represent the number of movies in each level.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have mapped mpaa underscore rating on X-axis.
Next, we have used geom underscore bar as we are plotting a bar chart.
Similarly, we can use
geom_line to draw a line chart
geom_boxplot to draw a box plot
Run the current line.
The bar chart appears in the Plots window.
Now, we will learn how to add labels to this bar chart.
In the Source window, after geom_bar(), type space plus sign and press Enter.
Now type the following commands.
Here, we have used labs argument to add label and title to the bar chart.
Run the current line.
The modified bar chart appears in the Plots window.
We can see that most of the movies have been rated as R in mpaa_rating.
Suppose, in this bar chart, we want to view the distribution of movies by genre.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Inside aes, we have added fill argument and set it to genre.
Run the current line.
The modified bar chart appears in the Plots window.
In the Plots window, click on the Zoom button to maximize the plot.
There are seven different colors in each bar.
Besides the plot, the meaning of each color has been given.
Close the plot.
In the Source window, click on movies data frame.
Now we will plot a histogram for the object named as runtime in movies.
Recall that, we have already learned how to plot a histogram using hist function.
Now we will use ggplot2 package to plot a histogram.
Click on the script aesPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
There are some warning messages, which we will ignore for now.
The histogram appears in the Plots window.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt,
What is aesthetic
How to create plots using aesthetic
Tuning parameters in aesthetic
We now suggest an assignment.
Using built-in data set mtcars, draw a bar chart from the object cyl.
Add suitable labels to this bar chart.
Please contact us.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Lists and its Operations.
Create a list in R
Access the elements of a list
Perform indexing on lists
Combine two lists
To understand this tutorial, you should know,
Data frames in  R
Matrices and vectors in R
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use,
A data frame CaptaincyData.csv
and A script file myList.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to Lists folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set this folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myList.R in RStudio.
I am resizing the Source window
Run this script by clicking on Source button.
captaincy data frame opens in the Source window.
Now let us create a matrix from a  subset of captaincy.
We will convert the values in first three rows of played, won and lost columns into a matrix.
Click on the script myList.R
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Press Enter at the end of every command.
Remember, as.matrix function is used to convert subData into a matrix.
Now let us create a numeric vector myVector.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the last three lines of code by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
I am resizing the Source window
The three objects subData, matrixA and myVector are loaded in our workspace.
We will learn how to create a list in R by using the list function.
A list is an R object.
It has components of mixed data types like
strings
numbers
vectors
some other list inside it.
A list can also contain a matrix or a function as its elements.
A vector having all elements of the same type is called atomic vector,
whereas, A vector having elements of different types is called list.
Let us switch to RStudio.
We will create a list containing captaincy, matrixA and myVector.
I am resizing the Source window
In the Source window, type the following command.
Now, we will assign names to the elements of myList.
For this, we will use names function.
In the Source window, type the following command.
We will assign the following names,
dataframe to captaincy.
matrix to matrixA
vector to myVector
In the Source window, now type print, myList in parentheses.
Run the last three lines of code.
I am resizing the Console window.
In the Console window, three elements of myList are shown with their respective names.
Hence, myList is a named list.
Now, we will learn how to access the elements of a list.
I am resizing the Console window.
Elements of the list can be accessed by the index of the elements in the list.
It is also known as indexing.
In case of named lists, it can also be accessed by using the names.
Suppose we want to access the element named as dataframe of myList.
In the Source window, type myList dollar sign dataframe
Run the current line.
captaincy dataframe, which is an element of myList, is shown on the Console.
We can also access an element by using its index.
Suppose we want to access the element named matrix of myList.
Index of matrix is 2 in myList.
In the Source window, type myList and 2 in square brackets.
Run the current line.
matrix element of myList is shown on the Console.
Now, suppose we want to access the third column of matrix element of myList.
For this, we use double square brackets.
In the Source window, type the following command.
2 in double square brackets denotes that second element of myList is to be accessed.
comma 3 in single square brackets denotes that third column of second element is to be accessed.
Remember we use single square bracket notation with two indices for indexing a data frame.
First index and second index refer to row and column respectively.
Also, leaving an index blank indicates that we want to keep all the elements in that dimension.
Run the current line.
The elements of third column of matrix element are displayed on the Console.
Now, let us learn how to combine two different lists.
First, we will create a simple list.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
Now, we declare an object named merged dot list.
It is used for storing the combined output of myList and listSimple.
In the Source window, type the following commands.
Save the script and run the last three lines of code.
I am maximizing the Console window.
Now, scroll up to locate the output.
The combined list is shown on the Console.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learned how to
Create a list in R
Access the elements of a list
Perform indexing on lists
Combine two lists
We now suggest an assignment.
Create a numeric vector c(1:5) and a 5 by 3 matrix with elements from 1 to 15.
Create a named list with vector, matrix and iris data set.
Retrieve the iris data set from the list using dollar operator and indexing method.
State the differences between the results obtained by using dollar operator and indexing method of accessing iris.

Draw a rectangle in perspective with larger side at the left side and smaller side at the right.
First select the text and then the rectangular path.
Go to Extensions, click on Modify Path and then on Perspective.
Now, we can see that the text appears in perspective.
Note, the text takes the starting point and direction of the path.
Next, let us create the text in another perspective.
Type TUTORIAL on the canvas.
Go to Path menu and click on Object to Path.
Draw a similar perspective rectangular path using Bezier tool.
This time, start from left top corner and continue in a clockwise direction.
First select the text and then the path.
Go to Extensions > Modify Path and then on Perspective.
Now we see the text appears from top to bottom.
This is because the text is aligned, based on the starting point of the path.
Lastly, we will learn about cut-out text.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on static members in C++.
Static keyword. Static variable
Static function.
Ubuntu OS version 11.10
g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with an introduction to static.
Static variables are initialized to zero before the first object is created.
Only one copy of the static variable exists for the whole program.
All the objects will share that variable.
It will remain in the memory till the  end of the program.
Static functions-
A static function may be called by itself without depending on any object.
To access a static function, we use-
classname :: (scope resolution operator) and the staticfunction();
Let us see an example on static memebers.
Note that our file name is static dot cpp.
Then we have class statex.
In this, we have a non-static variable as 'x' declared as private.
Then we have a static variable sum declared as public.
This is our constructor statex.
In this, we have incremented sum.
Then the value of sum is stored in 'x'.
Here we have a static function stat.
In this, we print the sum.
Then we have function number().
Here we print the number 'x'.
The class is closed here.
To declare the static variable globally, we use scope resolution operator.
To access a static variable we write as:
datatype classname scope resolution operator and the static variable name.
Now the storage is allocated to variable sum.
It is initialized to 0.
Here, we create objects of class statex
as o1, o2 and o3.
Then we call the function number() using the objects o1, o2 and o3.
Static function stat() is accessed here
using the class name and the  scope resolution operator.
Here, we print the static variable sum.
To compile, type:
g++ space static dot cpp space hyphen o space stat. Press Enter.
Type: ./stat (dot slash stat). Press Enter.
Number is: 0, 1, 2
Result is: 3
Now static var sum is 3.
Now, I will explain the output. Let me resize the window.
Here, first the value of number is 0 i.e.' x' is 0.
The first object gives the value as 0.
Then we have the value as 1 i.e. x =1.
The second object gives the value as 1.
And the third object gives the value as 2.
Then we call the stat() function which gives the value of sum.
Result is: sum.
Here, sum is incremented and stored in x.
Hence, this will give the value as 3.
Thus the final output we have is.
Static var sum is 3.
Now, let us create another object here as o4.
I will call the function number() using the object o4.
Let us execute.
Press the up arrow key twice.
Again press the up arrow key twice.
You can see that Result is 4.
Now static var sum is 4.
As the 4th object is created.
In this tutorial, we learned:
static keyword static variable
eg. static int sum;
static function. eg. static void stat()
As an assignment-  Create a class that declares a static variable,
decrement the variable,
And print the value.

and should know how to solve ODEs.
t zero is the initial time,
The solution to the equation will be a matrix with two rows.
Hence we plot both the rows with respect to time.
We are given the equation -
Assume epsilon is equal to zero point eight nine seven.
We substitute the value of epsilon with zero point eight nine seven.
Let sigma be equal to ten,  r be equal to twenty eight and b equal to eight by three.
Let us summarize this tutorial.

Let's create the syntax quickly.
The switch statement is a substitute for the if statement. It's a lot more neater and formattable choice although the input is an expression.
So, now let's input the value of something  and then let's save the value equal to this.
Then we can execute the code if it equals or matches this value.
It's not a comparison technique. So, for comparing an if statement for matching values and outputs that depend on the input, we're going to say switch.
Let's start.
switch  is the basic code for it.
Let's put an expression in here, for example, I will say "Alex" here.
Let's create a mini program and I will explain it as we go.
Just like the if statement we will put curly brackets here.
Now let's look at the way to call each sort of check.
We want to check the value here.
Now we will put this in quotation marks.
You can't even number obviously.
So, what we type is - case - the value of the case that we want to match. For example- "Alex".
Then we type a colon or a semicolon.
And then the condition if the case has matched with the switch expression you have picked.
So, I will type - echo "you have blue eyes".
To end our case comparison, we're going to use break and a semicolon.
Remember that we've used the semicolon here but not here.
Now the second case. Let's see how to do it.
I'll type "Billy" and echo "you have brown eyes".
Okay. And then break and semicolon.
This is like an integrated if. That is, I could say - if your name is "Alex" then echo "you have blue eyes" or else if your name is Billy, "you have brown eyes".
Probably for some people it's easy to do it this way. It's a lot more readable but it's a matter of choice.
Okay, we have got no more cases, I'm just going to use "Alex" and "Billy" for this example.
Here, I will say default which will echo out - "I don't know what color your eyes are".
Okay, we don't need a break after this because there are no more cases.
Obviously, there's no break after it because there are no more options to choose from.
Okay. So, we've got our switch here. Let's give it a go.
Now  I'm going to replace this "Alex" here with a variable to build our program.
So, I'll type $name equals and I will let you decide that.
Then I'll say $name here.
So, you see this is how we incorporate a variable here.
You should know how to do that by now.
So, let's start and see how this will work.
You'll say switch, you'll take this expression which is equal to "Alex".
Basically, this is the case which equals to "Alex" and it'll echo this.  The break is to end it.
If the name is say, "Rahul", the default will echo - "I don't know what colour your eyes are".
Okay, so let's try running this.
Just to revise.
We can see that "Alex" matches to "Alex", matches to the output.
What you can do is, you can enter as many lines of code here as you like.  This break determines where the case ends.
An if statement needs curly brackets to end a block.
However, here break determines the end of the block. These are called blocks, by the way.
So, let's change this to "Billy" and let's see what happens.
"You have brown eyes" - exactly what we determined here.
Okay, now I'll change this to "Kyle" and refresh. "I don't know what colour your eyes are" because there is no block that states Kyle's eye colour in our program feature.
So, that's basically the switch statement.
Try it out. Some people don't like using it, some prefer using it.
It's probably much faster than the if statement. It's easier to control.  It looks a lot better.  So, really it's up to your personal choice.

Dear Friends, Welcome to the spoken tutorial on  Advanced Control of Continuous Time systems.
Define a continuous time system: second and higher order
Plot response to step and sine inputs
Do a Bode plot
Study numer and  denom Scilab functions
Plot  poles and zeros of a system.
Ubuntu 12.04 as the operating system with
Scilab 5.3.3 version.
Before practicing this tutorial, a learner should have basic knowledge of Scilab and control systems.
For Scilab, please refer to the Scilab tutorials available on the Spoken Tutorial website.
In this tutorial, I will describe how to define second-order linear system.
So, first we have to define complex domain variable 's'.
Let us switch to the  Scilab console window.
Here, type s equal to poly open parenthesis zero comma open single quote s close single quote close parenthesis, press Enter.
The output is 's'.
There is another way to define 's' as continuous time complex variable.
On the console window, type:
s equal to percentage s, press Enter.
Let us study the syslin Scilab command.
Use the Scilab function ’syslin’  to define the continuous time system.
G of s is equal to 2 over 9 plus 2 s plus s square.
Use csim with step option, to obtain the step response and then plot the step response.
Let us switch to the Scilab console window.
Here, type: sys capital G equal to syslin open parenthesis open single quote c close single quote comma two divide by open parenthesis s square plus two asterisk s plus nine close parenthesis close parenthesis
Here c is used, as we are defining a continuous time system.
The output is linear second order system represented by
2 over 9 plus 2 s plus s square.
Then, type t equal to zero colon zero point one colon ten semicolon
Then type   y one is equal to c sim open parenthesis open single quote step close single quote comma t comma sys capital G close the parenthesis semicolon
Then type  plot open parenthesis t comma y one close parenthesis semicolon
The output will display the step response of the given second order system.
Let us study the Second Order system response for sine input.
Sine inputs can easily be given as inputs to a  second order system to a continuous time system.
Let us switch to the Scilab console window.
Type U two is equal to sine open parenthesis t close parenthesis semicolon.
Then type: y two is equal to c sim open parenthesis u two comma t comma sys capital G close the bracket semicolon.
Here we are using  sysG, the continuous time second order system, we had defined earlier.
Then type: plot open parenthesis t comma open square bracket u two semicolon y two close square bracket close parenthesis.
Make sure that you place a semicolon between u2 and y2 because u2 and y2 are row vectors of the same size.
This plot shows the response of the system to a step input and sine input. It is called the response plot.
Response Plot plots both the input and the output on the same graph.
As expected, the output is also a sine wave and
there is a phase lag between the input and output.
Amplitude is different for the input and the output as it is being passed through a transfer function.
This is a typical under-damped example.
Let us plot  bode plot of 2 over 9 plus 2 s plus s square.
Please note, command 'f r e q' is a Scilab command for frequency response.
Do not use f r e q as a variable!!
Open the  Scilab console and type:
f r is equal to open square bracket zero point zero one colon zero point one colon ten close square bracket semicolon.
The frequency is in Hertz.
Then type bode open parenthesis sys capital G comma fr close parenthesis.
The bode plot is shown.
Let us define another system.
We have an  over-damped system p equal to s square plus nine s plus nine
Let us plot step response for this system.
Type this on your  console:
p is equal to s square plus nine asterisk s plus nine
and then press  Enter.
Then type this on your console:
sys two is equal to syslin open parenthesis open single quote c close single quote comma nine divided by p close parenthesis
and press  Enter.
Then type: t equal to zero colon zero point one colon ten semicolon
y is equal to c sim open parenthesis open single quote step close single quote comma t comma sys two close parenthesis semicolon.
Then type plot open parenthesis t comma y close parenthesis.
The response plot for over damped system is shown.
To find the roots of p type this on your console -
roots of p and press Enter.
These roots are the poles of the system sys two.
The roots or poles of the system are shown.
Please plot Step response for this system along similar lines, as for over damped system.
G of s is equal to 2 over 9 plus 6 s plus s square which is a critically damped system
Then G of s is equal to two over 9 plus s square which is an undamped system
G of s is equal to 2 over 9 minus 6 s plus s square which is an unstable system
Check response to sinusoidal inputs for all the cases and plot bode plot too.
Switch to  Scilab console.
For a general transfer function, the numerator and denominator can be specified separately.
Let me show you how.
Type on  console:
sys three is equal to syslin open parenthesis open single quote c close single quote comma s plus six comma s square plus six asterisk s plus nineteen close parenthesis.
Another way of defining a system is to type:
g is equal to open parenthesis s plus six close parenthesis divided by open parenthesis s square plus six asterisk s plus nineteen close parenthesis
Then type this on your console:
sys four is equal to syslin open parenthesis open single quote c close single quote comma g close parenthesis.
Both ways, we get the same output;
six plus s over 19 plus six s plus s square.
The variable ’sys’ is of type ’rational’.
Its numerator and denominator can be extracted by various ways.
Sys of two, numer of sys or numer of g gives the numerator.
The denominator can be calculated using sys(3) or denom of sys functions.
The poles and zeros of the system can be plotted using p l z r function.
The syntax is p l z r of sys.
The plot shows 'x for poles' and 'circles for zeros'.
Type this on your Scilab console:
sys three open parenthesis two close parenthesis.
Press Enter.This gives the numerator of the rational function sys three that is '6 + s'.
Otherwise, you can type:
numer open parenthesis sys three close parenthesis.
The numerator of system three is shown.
To get the denominator, type:
sys three open parenthesis three close parenthesis. Press Enter.
The denominator of the function is shown.
You can also type denom open parenthesis sys three close parenthesis.
Then type p l z r open parenthesis sys three close parenthesis.
The output graph plots the poles and zeros.
It shows 'cross and circle' for 'poles and zeros' of the system respectively.
It is plotted on the complex plane.
In this tutorial, we have learnt how to:
Define a system by its transfer function.
Plot step and sinusoidal responses.
Extract poles and zeros of a transfer function.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial- More on single dimensional array in awk.
scan the elements of an array,
Delete statement,
ARGV array and ENVIRON array.
To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorial on array in our website.
Previously we covered some aspects of awk arrays.
Now let us see how we can use awk array with a file.
We will use the same file awkdemo.txt that we have used earlier.
Here, the first field is roll number and sixth field is stipend of the student.
Let us first calculate the HRA for all students.
Here, HRA is 30% of their stipend amount.
I have already written the code and saved it as calculate_hra.awk.
Inside the BEGIN section, the field separator is initialized with the Pipe symbol.
Then, in the action section we are initializing the array elements.
This section will get executed once for each line of an input file.
I have declared "hra" as an array variable and dollar one as index.
Here dollar 1 indicates the 1st field, that is roll number.
So, array hra at index roll number will contain the corresponding HRA amount as a value.
How can we scan all the elements of this array?
You should use this variation of for loop.
This loop executes statements once for each index in the array.
The variable var will be set to the index values one by one.
The code is written inside END section.
This section will be executed after awk has processed all the lines of the input file.
Variable i will be initialized to every index value or roll number one by one.
In each iteration of the for loop, the HRA for a particular roll number will be printed.
Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space calculate_hra.awk space awkdemo.txt .
The output shows the roll number and HRA for all the students.
Now say, I want to delete the record for the student with roll S02.
So, we have to delete the array element at index S02.
Let me do this using the calculate_hra.awk code.
Before the for loop, press Enter and type the following code:
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Let me clear the terminal.
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
The record for the student with roll number S02 is not printed in the output.
So, any array element can be deleted using the delete command.
You have to mention the array name with the index.
What if I want to delete an entire array?
Let us switch to the code to try this.
Delete the index S02 along with the quotes and square brackets from the delete statement.
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Clear the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
See, we are not getting any output.
Remember, in an earlier tutorial on awk built-in variables, we had said-
ARGV is an array that stores the command line arguments.
I have already written the code in argc_argv.awk.
The code is written within awk BEGIN section.
First we are printing the number of arguments, that is the value of ARGC.
Next, using the for loop, we are looping for the value of i from 0 to ARGC-1.
And, we are printing ARGV at index i.
Now, type on the terminal- awk space hyphen small f space argc underscore argv dot awk space one space two space three.
Here, one two three are the command line arguments.
We get the number of arguments as 4.
Let us have a look at the individual arguments.
Next, we have three arguments that we supplied in the command line.
That is why the value of ARGC is always the number of command line arguments supplied plus one.
The array element indices are the environment variable names.
Let us see how we can see the values of different environment variables.
First, let us print our username.
We need to print the value of environment variable USER.
At the command prompt, type the following.
The output will show the name of the user who logged in.
In this tutorial, we learnt about-
Scan the elements of an array,
Delete statement,
Paper presentation allowance which is 80% of the stipend,
Performance incentive which is 20% of the stipend.
Store the allowances in two different arrays.
Print the total amount required for each allowance and the average.
Print the value of environment variable PATH from awk program.

Close the Preferences window.
Now we will check if exterior angle is equal to sum of interior opposite angles.
In the input bar, open the parentheses.
Then press  plus sign on the keyboard and select beta.
Observe in the Algebra view a new angle tau equal to epsilon is created.
Angle tau is the sum of the angles alpha and beta.
Using the Move tool drag point C and observe the changes.
Next I will open a new window with triangle ABC and angles already drawn.
We will draw altitudes and an orthocentre to the triangle ABC.
For this first we will draw external lines on all the sides of triangle ABC.
Click the Line tool, then click on points A, B.
Similarly click on points B, C and A, C.
Now we will draw altitudes to the triangle ABC.
Click on the Perpendicular Line tool.
Similarly click on point B and line h.
The three altitudes of the triangle meet at a point.
Click on the Intersect tool and mark the point of intersection as D.
Point D is the orthocenter of the triangle ABC.
Let us rename point  D as orthocenter.
From the sub-menu select Rename.
Rename text box opens.
In the Rename text box type Orthocenter.

Observe that the angle bisectors intersect at a point.
Let's mark the point as D using Intersect tool.
Let us construct a line perpendicular to segment BC, passing through D.
Select the Perpendicular Line tool, click on point D and then on segment BC.
Observe that the perpendicular line intersects BC at a point.
Let's mark this point as E using Intersect tool.
Now, Let's construct a circle with centre  D and which passes through E.
Click on Circle with Centre through point tool, click on point D and then click on point E.
A circle which touches all sides of the triangle is drawn.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial we have learnt to, Draw a triangle and measure its angles.
Display perimeter and area of the triangle
Show that sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees
Show that, exterior angle is equal to sum of the interior opposite angles.
We have also learnt to draw, Altitudes of the triangle and located the orthocenter.
An incircle to a triangle.
As an assignment, Draw a circumscribed circle to the triangle.
Hint: Draw perpendicular bisectors to the sides of the triangle.
Your assignment should look like this.
Another assignment- Draw medians to the triangle.
Mark the intersection point of medians.
Hint: Mark midpoints of the sides.
Your assignment should look like this.

This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
R version 3.4.4
RStudio version 1.1.463
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
For this tutorial, we will use
A data frame moviesData.csv
A script file myVis.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to DataVis folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set the DataVis folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to RStudio.
Open the script myVis.R in RStudio.
We have already learnt how to use the filter and arrange functions in the dplyr package.
Run this script by clicking on the Source button.
movies data frame and other filtered data frames open in the Source window.
We will close all the data frames except movies.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
This will enable us to see the remaining objects of the movies data frame.
To select the required variables of a data frame  we will use the select function.
It helps us to select only those variables that are required.
Here, we will use the select function to select title, genre, and imdb rating for all the movies.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
The first argument in the select function is the name of the data frame.
Other arguments are the variables which we will select for all the movies.
Save the script and run the last two lines of code by pressing Ctrl + Enter keys simultaneously.
moviesTGI opens in the Source window.
Here, title, genre, and imdb rating of all the movies are displayed.
Let us close moviesTGI data frame for now.
In the Source window, click on movies data frame.
Scroll the data frame from right to left to see other columns.
In the data frame, we can see the variables like thtr_rel_day, thtr_rel_month, thtr_rel_year.
These variables provide information about the day, month and year of the theater release of the movies.
Let us select these three variables along with the title of all the movies.
Please note that all the theater-related variable names start with t h t r.
Click on the script myVis.R.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have used starts_with function.
It selects all the variables in the movies data frame, whose names start with t h t r.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesTHT opens in the Source window.
Movies with their titles and theater-release information are shown.
Let us close moviesTHT data frame for now.
In the Source window, click on movies.
Let us change the name of the variable thtr_rel_year.
For that, we will use the rename function.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we are changing the name of the variable thtr_rel_year.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesR opens in the Source window.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
Observe that the name of the variable thtr_rel_year has changed to rel_year.
Let us close the data frame moviesR for now.
In the Source window, click on movies.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
Suppose we want to add a new variable named CriAud to our movies data frame.
This variable should contain the difference between critics_score and audience_score.
mutate function is used to add a new variable and preserve the existing one.
For simplicity let us remove the variables appearing after audience_score in the movies data frame.
In the Source window, scroll from right to left.
We need to select the variables from title to audience_score.
For this, we will use the select function.
Click on the script myVis.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the current line.
Now, we will use the mutate function to add a new variable.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Remember, we are adding a new variable named CriAud in the movies data frame.
This is to store the difference of critics score and audience score.
Run the last two lines of code.
moviesMu opens in the Source window.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right.
A new variable named CriAud is added.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about the following functions available in the dplyr package:
select
rename
mutate
We now suggest an assignment.
Use the built-in data set airquality. Using select function select the variables Ozone, Wind, and Temp in this data set.
Use the built-in data set mtcars. Rename the variables mpg and cyl with MilesPerGallon and Cylinder, respectively.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Polynomials.
In this tutorial we learn about,
Degree of the polynomials
Remainder theorem
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with GeoGebra interface.
Let us first define a polynomial.
An algebraic expression containing one or more terms with non-zero coefficients is a polynomial.
For example
I have already opened the GeoGebra interface.
For this tutorial we will use input bar to solve the polynomials.
Let us first start with slope of a polynomial.
In the input bar type, r within brackets  x is equal to 3x minus 3
The linear polynomial is displayed in the Algebra and Graphics views.
Now type Slope within brackets r and press Enter.
Slope of r is shown on the line and in the Algebra view.
Now we will define the degree of a polynomial.
The highest power of the variable in a polynomial, is the degree of the polynomial.
In this polynomial, degree is '5'.
Let’s try some more examples to find the degree of polynomials.
In the input bar type, Degree.
In place of polynomial type, 3x raised to the power of 7 plus 4x raised to the power of 6 plus x plus 9
The degree of the polynomial is displayed in the Algebra view as 7.
Similarly degree of the polynomial, 5x raised to the power of 5 minus 4x squared minus 6 is 5.
Now I will explain about zeros of the polynomial.
Let us delete all the objects.
Press Ctrl + A to select all objects, then press Delete key on the keyboard.
To find zeros of the polynomial, in the input bar type,
I will drag the boundary of the Algebra view  to see the polynomial clearly.
Move the Graphics view, if you cannot see the parabola.
Now we will find the values of p of 0, p of 1, p of 2 and p of 3.
In the input bar type p, then type 0 within brackets and press Enter.
The value of p of 0 is displayed in the Algebra view.
Similarly I will type p of 1, p of 2 and p of 3.
Values of p of 1, p of 2 and p of 3 are displayed in the Algebra view.
Pause the tutorial and complete this assignment.
I will clear the interface once again.
Now let us find the roots of the polynomial.
In the input bar type, p is equal to x squared minus x minus 2 and press Enter.
Polynomial p of x is displayed in the Algebra view.
Its graph, a parabola, is displayed in the Graphics view.
If required, drag the Graphics view to view the parabola clearly.
Next type Root within brackets p and press Enter.
Roots of the polynomial p are displayed as points A and B in Algebra and Graphics views.
Let us type one more polynomial.
Polynomial q of x is displayed in the Algebra view.
Its graph, a parabola, is displayed in the Graphics view.
Type Root within brackets q and press Enter.
Roots of the polynomial q are displayed as points C and D in the Algebra and Graphics views.
Here we see that the points B and C coincide with each other.
Using the Move tool, we can move the labels to see them clearly.
Next we will use Remainder theorem to divide polynomials.
Let p of x be any polynomial of degree greater or equal to 1.
And 'a' be any real number.
If p of x is divided by a linear polynomial x minus a, then the remainder is p of a.
Dividend is equal to Divisor multiplied by  Quotient plus remainder.
Let us open a new Geogebra window. Click on File and New Window.
In the input bar type, p1 is equal to 3x squared plus x minus 1 and press Enter.
Then type p2 is equal to x plus 1 and press Enter.
Now we will divide the polynomial p1 with p2.
In the input bar type, Division.
In place of Dividend Polynomial type p1.
Two lines intersecting each other appear in the Graphics view.
These lines represent division of the polynomials p1 and p2.
Quotient and remainder of the division are shown as a list.
L1 is equal to within curly braces 3x minus 2 comma 1.
To show the second set of polynomials, I will open the Graphics 2 view.
I will drag boundary to see the Graphics 2 view clearly.
Then I will type polynomials q1 and q2 in the input bar.
q1 is equal to 4x cube minus 3x squared minus x plus 1 Press Enter.
q2 is equal to x plus 1  and press Enter.
Type Division, followed by polynomials q1 comma q2 within brackets and press Enter.
Quotient and remainder of the division are shown as a list.
L2 is equal to within curly braces 4xsquared minus7x plus 6 comma minus 5
Here quotient is 4xsquared minus7x plus 6 and remainder is -5.
Pause the video and solve the exercises based on remainder theorem.
Now let us factorize the polynomials.
Let us open a new GeoGebra window.Click on File and New Window.
In the input bar type, p is equal to x squared minus 5x plus 6 and press Enter.
Type Factors and select Factors Polynomial option.
In the place of the polynomial type p within brackets x and press Enter.
Drag boundary to see the Algebra view clearly.
M1 is displayed in the Algebra view.
Here (x minus 3) and (x minus 2) are factors of the polynomial p of x.
Let us try another example.
Type Factors then type within brackets x cube minus 2x squared minus x plus 2
M2 is displayed in the Algebra view.
Pause the video and solve the exercises based on factorization.
Let us summarize what we have learnt.
In this tutorial we have learnt about,
Zeros of the polynomials
Remainder theorem

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Using Charts and Graphs in Spreadsheets.
Create,  Edit,  Resize
Format,  Move and  Delete
Charts can powerfully convey information to the reader
LibreOffice Calc offers a variety of chart formats for our data
Using Calc, we can customize charts to a considerable extent
Let us open our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
Please download and extract the file
Notice that all cell borders are incomplete.
Select cells A1 to H8.
Then go to the Formatting toolbar and select the dropdown next to the Borders icon.
Select the option that will display all borders.
Click anywhere outside the selected area to deselect the cells.
Our chosen border style is now applied to all the selected cells.
We do not need the Days and Date columns anymore.
So, let us delete them as shown.
Let us fill the amount spent for each item listed in the Spent column.
Next, we’ll fill the amounts received for each item listed in the Received column.
Let us now format the values in Spent and Received columns to INR currency format.
Select the cells D3 to E7, by holding the Shift key and clicking like this.
On the Formatting toolbar, select the dropdown of the Format as Currency icon.
Scroll down and select the option INR ₹ English India.
Click anywhere outside the selected area to deselect the cells.
Now our spreadsheet has the necessary data we need to proceed ahead.
So, let us see how to create a chart for this data.
To create a chart, first we have to select the data to be included in the chart.
Select cells A1 to E7.
The selection can be verified in the Name Box at the top left.
Now, click on the Insert Chart icon in the Standard toolbar.
Alternatively, we can click on the Insert menu in the menu bar.
Either ways, the Chart Wizard dialog box opens.
For now, keep the default settings and click on the Finish button at the bottom.
A chart gets inserted in the spreadsheet based on our data.
But, the chart is covering up some of the data.
When the chart is selected, we see handles around it.
Click and drag any of the corner handles to resize the chart proportionally.
Now let’s move the chart.
Place the cursor on any one of the borders till the cursor turns into a hand.
Click and move the chart to the desired location and then release the mouse button.
Click anywhere else outside the Chart to deselect it.
Now, we can see our data and the Chart clearly.
To customise the Chart, double-click on it.
Immediately, the Formatting toolbar shows only the options related to the Chart.
If you wish to exit the Chart edit mode, click anywhere outside the Chart.
First, we will learn to add a Title to this chart.
Click on the Titles icon on the Formatting toolbar.
The Titles dialog box opens.
In the Title text field, type Finance Tracker.
Leave the rest of the fields as default.
Then click on the OK button at the bottom.
Observe that the title Finance Tracker, is displayed at the top center of the chart.
Next, let us learn how to change the Chart Type.
Click on the Chart Type icon on the Formatting toolbar.
The Chart Type dialog box opens.
On the left we can see a list of available Chart Types.
Column type is selected by default.
On the right side, we can see three sub-types of Column charts.
This will vary based on the selected Chart type.
We will retain the Normal sub-type Column chart.
If we check the 3D Look option, the chart will get displayed in three dimensions.
Immediately we see that the Shape option gets enabled.
Select the shape as Cylinder and also select the sub-type as Deep.
Then click on the OK button at the bottom.
Observe the change in the chart on the spreadsheet.
Explore the other combinations on your own later.
Next, let us learn how to change the Data Range.
Click on the Data Ranges icon on the Formatting toolbar.
The Data Ranges dialog box opens.
Using this option, we can manually edit the range of data we want to represent in the chart.
The default option for plotting data is Data series in columns.
But we can change how we want to plot the data.
Let’s change this and use Data series in rows.
This is useful if we use a style of chart such as Column to display our data.
Next, we can choose whether to use
This is my selection.
Now, suppose we wish to remove the data under the column Received.
To do that, first click inside the Data range field.
Then change the range from $A$1 is to $E$7 to $A$1 is to $D$7.
The data under the column Received will no longer be represented when the chart is ready.
Next, we’ll see the functions of the Data Series.
So, click on the Data Series tab.
Notice there are 6 fields representing the column headings of our data.
The Add and Remove buttons will allow us to add or remove rows of data from the chart.
We can also sort the data by using the Down and Up buttons.
Now we have finished selecting the data and how to represent the data in the chart.
So we will click on the OK button at the bottom.
Observe all the changes we made in the chart.
Next, let us learn how to further customise the Chart area.
Click on the Chart Area icon from the Formatting toolbar.
There are 3 tabs at the top - Borders, Area and Transparency.
There’s a large white box here which is the preview area.
Let us change the style and color of the chart's border.
To do so, click on the Style drop-down and choose Continuous.
Then in the Color drop-down, we’ll choose Green.
Notice the changes in the preview area.
Now click on the OK button at the bottom.
Click outside the chart to see all the changes.
Notice that the style and color of the chart border has changed.
Let us check out a few more formatting options.
Make sure the chart is in Edit mode only.
On the Formatting toolbar, there are 4 axis icons.
These axis options help to format the lines that create the chart.
These also format the font of the text that appears on both the X and Y axes.
Click on the X Axis icon in the Formatting toolbar.
Here we can see various tabs at the top to customise the X Axis.
Press the Esc key or click on the Cancel button at the bottom to exit the dialog box.
Likewise, we can also format the Y Axis by clicking on the Y Axis icon in the Formatting toolbar.
Explore the other axis icons on your own later.
Calc provides an option for changing the colour of the chart wall.
The chart wall is the border surrounding the chart graphic, including the main title and key.
To format, click on the Chart Wall icon in the Formatting toolbar.
Go to the Borders tab if not already selected.
Under the Line Properties option, we can see that the Style is set to Continuous.
From the Color drop-down, let’s choose Red.
Then change the width to 0.10cm by clicking the plus icon.
Now click on the OK button at the bottom.
We can see the style and colour of the chart wall has now changed.
Next, we will learn how to remove and add the Legend.
Click on the Legend ON/OFF icon in the Formatting toolbar.
Click again on the Legend ON/OFF icon and the legend reappears.
Next we will learn how to resize charts by using the Position and Size dialog box.
Now right-click on the chart.
The Position and Size dialog box appears.
Select the Position and Size tab at the top.
The Position section has various fields that can set the X and Y positions of the chart.
We can also adjust the width and height of the chart  under the Size section.
Let’s set the X coordinate to 1.00 and Y coordinate to 0.80.
And click on the OK button at the bottom.
Notice that the position of the chart has changed according to the assigned values.
Apart from these options available in the Formatting toolbar, we can format the chart in two other ways.
Either go to the Format menu in the menu bar. Or right click on the chart.
To see the formatting options, make sure that the chart is in edit mode.
Lastly let’s learn how to delete a chart.
Click on the chart and press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Notice that the chart is now deleted from the spreadsheet.
Now let’s save and close the file.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Edit and format the charts and  Delete a chart
As an assignment
Insert a Pie chart for the data . Resize and move the chart to the bottom right corner of the sheet

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Finding and Evaluating Modules.
Earlier in the series, we’ve talked about extending a website through Modules.
And, we have covered some of the Modules that come with Drupal.
We’ve even installed the Module devel earlier in the course.
But, now we’ll understand how to evaluate and find great Modules.
Let’s go to drupal.org/project/modules.
There are almost 18,000 Modules available for Drupal here.
Please note that a Drupal Module only works with the version of Drupal that it’s intended for.
So, we have to update the Core compatibility to the version of Drupal we’re using.
This tutorial has been recorded before the release of Drupal 8.
For this demo, I’ll switch back to Drupal 7, in order to show you some great things about Modules.
Click Search. And, there are 11,000 Modules for Drupal 7. That’s a huge difference.
With time, we will see the number of Drupal 8 Modules rapidly increase.
Meanwhile, let’s learn how to evaluate good Modules.
On this page, let us filter on the Core compatibility of the version of Drupal we are using.
Chaos tool suite or ctools and Views are the all time popular Modules of Drupal.
Let’s click on Views.
There’s a simple 3-step approach to evaluating a good Module.
Suppose, we go to the licensing bureau to get a new license to drive or register a car.
In most US states, it’s called the dmv or the Department of Motor Vehicles.
'd' stands for documentation, 'm' stands for maintainers and 'v' stands for versions.
Look at the information given under the Project Information and Downloads.
Let’s start with 'd'. Views is the second most popular Module of all time.
In fact, it’s being incorporated into Drupal 8 and we’ve actually used Views a lot, in this course.
There is no other shortcut in open source to understand whether a Module is right or not, except to read the documentation.
Always, read the documentation to know what a Module does.
Read the documentation to know what the issues are.
How do we know there’s help available?
Once we install a Module, we should read the documentation to know which parts to turn on.
Reading the documentation is extremely important.
Please note, in open source, there is no-one to sue if a Module destroys your site.
You have to read the documentation and determine whether the Module is compatible with what you’ve done on your site already.
So, I can’t emphasize it enough. Read all of this information by clicking on-
to find out what is in this Module. So, that’s the 'd'.
The 'm' stands for maintainers.
This particular Module was started by merlinofchaos.
Now, when we click on his name, it takes us to his Drupal profile.
Later in the course, we will learn how to have our own Drupal profile.
Here, we see that Earl Miles is a big contributor to the Drupal Project - over 6300 commits.
There are a number of other maintainers for this particular Module.
With Modules-
Both are ok.
But say, a Module happens to be mission-critical, and the maintainer is unable to continue with it. Then we might be in trouble.
So, that’s something to consider.
Finally at the bottom, is the Project information and the Versions or our 'v'.
The maintenance status of 'v' is, right now, seeking co-maintainers. We need not worry.
Views has already been incorporated into Drupal 8. So, they’re probably just looking for some help there.
It’s "under active development".
It’s on almost a million sites. And the stats show 7 point 6 million downloads already.
Now, this is important. If a Project says “abandoned” or “I’ve given up”, then avoid using that Module.
You won’t see that very often, however.
Always use the Version of the Module that is the same as the Version of your Drupal installation.
There is no Drupal 8 version here because Views is already in core.
But, if I was installing this on a Drupal 7 site, I would not click on this link.
It will take us to a node that gives detailed information about this Module.
Instead, right-click on the tar or the zip and click on Copy Link.
This was mentioned earlier when we installed devel.
How do we determine if a Module is right for us?
As simple as d m v.
One of the frequently asked questions is- How does one find a Module?
One option is to go todurpal [dot] org slash project slash modules.
And filter by Core compatibility - Categories, of which there are many.
Otherwise, it is impossible to find Modules that we need at drupal [dot] org.
If you are good at it, you will be able to find them. But new users might get confused with the number of Modules listed there.
Again the question will be - which Module is right for me?
Google is your friend!
If we’re looking for a Drupal Module with a Date field then just type: "drupal module date".
And, the first thing that comes up is the Date Module.
We know that because the URL is drupal [dot] org slash project slash date.
What if we need a Rating system?
Type: "drupal module rating system".
Now, we get 2 options here-
So, we have 2 Modules that we can look at, to determine which one might be better for us.
What about if we need a webform?
Again type: "drupal module webform".
And, we get a project named Webform.
This is probably the best way to find Modules, for beginners.
Drupal module and a description of what we need our Module to do.
I hope that’s been helpful. Remember, to find Modules, Google is your friend.
And, to understand which Module is best for you, remember d m and v.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Modifying the Display of Content.
Now, we have our content. Let’s see how it actually looks and how Drupal renders it to the page.
Note that in the Teaser mode, we get the Title and the Body with a Read more.
As we scroll down, we can also see all of our new content here.
By default, Drupal outputs the last 10 nodes created that have been promoted to the Homepage.
Notice, there is some pagination down here at the bottom- page 1, 2, 3, Next and Last.
If we click on Last, we will see a listing of the nodes in Teaser mode, with a Read more after the Title.
This is not appealing.
Drupal allows us to set up what it calls “View modes”.
Click on Structure and then Content Types.
Now, let’s update the layout for our 'Events' Content type.
Click on the drop-down, then click on the Manage display.
Notice here at the top, on the Manage display tab, there is a Default and a Teaser.
Default is the default layout – we are going to add one of the Full view layout.
Next is the Teaser layout. Let’s click on Teaser.
In the Teaser mode, the only thing that is visible is the Event Description. And the Links, which is the Read more link.
Here it says "Trimmed limit: 600 characters".
We will update some of these things to make the Teaser mode for our 'Event' Content type look better.
Before we proceed, we need to understand that Drupal gives us what is called Layouts.
Let’s click on Structure and Display modes.
Then click on View modes. Notice, there is Form modes as well.
This Form modes is the layout for how data is entered.
This View modes is the layout for how data is viewed.
Click on View modes.
Under the Content View mode, we see  Full content, RSS, Search index, Search results, Teaser.
We can also add a new Content View mode.
The key thing is - we are not limited to what Drupal gives us out of the box.
We also have Blocks, Comments, Taxonomy terms and Users.
We can add our own View modes to any of these.
Please make a note of that. It is an important thing to remember.
These are the ones that are available. But all are not enabled for every Content type.
Let us go back and do that.
Let’s go back to Structure and click Content types.
On the Events Content type, click Manage display.
Once again, we’re on this page where we have Default and Teaser.
Scroll down to the bottom and click on CUSTOM DISPLAY SETTINGS.
Put a check-mark in Full content.
This will allow us to manipulate how the fields are laid out, when we are actually looking at a node.
Click Save.
Now, here at the top, we have Full content and Teaser.
Next, we will learn how to update both of these View modes.
First, let's update the Full Content view.
These are the fields in our Full Content layout and the order they’re in and how the LABELs appear.
As a reminder, let’s go back and take a look at an event.  Click on DrupalCamp Cincinnati.
The body is at the top.
Event website, Date, Topics and the logo if we had one.
Now, let’s clean these up to make our content look a little better.
Structure > Content types > Manage display for Events and then click on Full Content.
Here, Event Description is in full mode.
Let’s drag that down below Logo.
Then, let’s hide the LABEL for the Logo
and change it from Original image to a Medium size.
This is an Image style.
We will learn more about Image styles when we get to Views.
Understand that we are able to generate any size image in any Image style that we want.
Then we can use it anywhere we want.  Let’s click on Update.
Now our Event Logo will be on the left because this Theme floats the images to the left.
The Body will wrap around it.
Let’s put the Event Date as LABEL Inline.
Let’s change the Format now.
Click on the gear on the right. We use a gear to configure something.
We will change this to the Default long date.
Click Update.  This is nicer.
Let’s keep Event Sponsors as Inline.
You will notice that the output is linked to the referenced entity.
That means,  if the Cincinnati User Group is sponsoring DrupalCamp Cincinnati,  that will be a link to the User Group page.
That is exactly what we want.
Since Event Topics is presented in a column, we will choose Above.
Once again, it is linked to the Referenced entity.
Now, please pause the tutorial and check that your screen looks like mine.
Let’s take a look at one of our nodes in Full View mode.
Click on Content and then on any event here.
The names of your Events and the text will be very different from mine.
That’s just because devel uses Lorem Ipsum.
Click on any Event here.
You should now see a layout that looks something like this.
This looks very nice.
Event Website, Event Date, Event Sponsors.
There is a little problem with the Event Topics, but for that we can just use some CSS.
Their links point to the correct places.
Let’s update the full display for our User Groups Content type.
Click on Structure > Content types and then  on Manage display, in the User Groups.
Once again, we need to update our Views.
Scroll down, click CUSTOM DISPLAY SETTINGS and choose Full content.
We can update any of these displays as per our preference. Click Save.
Then choose Full content. This is similar to what we did with our Events.
Let’s put the Group Website above Description and the site Inline.
Put the Group Contact and Email together again, making their LABELs Inline.
I prefer to leave the Email as Plain text, rather than Email link.
This is because I don’t use my default Email program to send email anymore.
I prefer to keep this as Plain text.
Keep Group Experience Level as "Above", because its a list of all of the experience.
Finally, keep Events sponsored as "Above" as well.
Leave the FORMAT as "Label".
We could choose Entity ID or Rendered entity also.
But, on doing so, we will end up with a whole bunch of Event pages there.
I will keep this as "Label".
Here is the "Link to the referenced entity".
Using this, we can click the link to go to DrupalCamp Cincinnati in the Cincinnati User Group.
Let’s click on Save and check what we did.
Click Content and click on a User Group in the list.
Here we have the Group website, the description, the Contact information. This is created by devel.
A Contact Email - this is fake id which is also created by devel.
The key thing here is, it works!
Here is Group Experience Level.  Notice that devel has double selected something.
We will just leave it as it is for now.
Lastly, the Event sponsored is "DrupalCamp Cincinnati".
This layout is the best that we can get, without adding any Display or Layout modules.
We have done the Full content successfully.
Next, let us learn to update our Teaser modes. If you look at these two, they are not that bad.
But as you scroll down, our Teaser modes are not very nice.
We can fix that easily.
Click on Structure and Content types.
In the Events, click on Manage display, then on Teaser.
Drupal gives us links and Event Description which is the body field.
Let’s now update our Teaser mode for this.
Just drag the Event Website to the top and choose Inline.
Then drag Event Date up as well because it is important.
Next, drag the Event Logo and put it at the top as well.
We will hide the LABEL and change the FORMAT to Thumbnail.
We can create Image styles for any image on our site.
But we will learn about it later.
Change the Link image  as Content.
This makes the logo as a link straight into the content. Now click Update.
We have the logo, the website and the date.
Drag the Links to the bottom.
Next, let’s trim the Event Description.
Click the gear and change this to 400 characters.
Click Update. Then click the drop-down and change the option to Trimmed.
Now, our  Teaser mode should have:
Let’s see how it looks for now. Click Save.
Go back to the site.
You will see that DrupalCamp Cincinnati has been updated.
We will update the Date field later.
You will notice that the Body has been trimmed.
Click on Structure.  Click Content types > Events > Manage display and Teaser.
Most of this is OK except for Event Date.  Instead of Time ago we will choose Custom.
Notice here, there is a link to the PHP documentation for Date Formats.
Let’s update Date-Time format now.
First of all, delete that.
Lowercase l comma capital F jS comma and capital Y.
This means  the day of the week,  the day of the month,
and then the appropriate suffix - st nd rd th  and the four digit year.
Click Update.
We can now see a preview of the date here.
Click Save.
Let’s hide the Event Description, for now.
Let’s take a look at our site.
Now, our Teaser for our Event can be seen here -  the Title, the logo, the website and the Event Date.
Let’s update the Teaser mode for our User Groups.
Click on Structure > Content types and then  on Manage display in the User Groups.
Then click on Teaser.
This one is a little different because we do not have any images.
We could have had a User Group logo.
Let’s put the User Group Website at the top.
We will not display the User Group Description.
Let’s keep the Group Contact email.
And change the label Group Website and Contact Email to "Inline".
Here again, I like to keep the FORMAT as Plain text, because I don’t use my default email.
This is a very simple Teaser mode.
Click Save.
Back to our site.
The Cincinnati User Group has a Group Website and the Contact Email with a Read more.
This is how we update the View modes for both the Full content and the Teaser mode.
In subsequent tutorials, we will go to our landing pages and get our content out, in a usable form.
With this. we come to the end of this tutorial.  Let us summarize.

Welcome to Meet The GIMP.
I got an e-mail from Jeson in New York and he just stopped the show about Triptychs, to find a different way of doing it, before I started doing triptychs.
And he found a different way with using layer mask.
And I think I should show you that in this tutorial.
I can't show you the image which Jeson used for doing Triptychs because he used images which are not freely available, so I can't use them.
Using layer mask for doing Triptychs is very easy and I have modified his concept a bit about using a layer mask.
I wonder why I didn't have that idea.
And I want to do a triptych with these three shots here.
I want to have this image on the left side, this 2nd one in the middle and this one on the right side.
I want to change these square frames to something which suits this image.
We will see how this works out.
Now I can start making the Triptychs with these images here and I press tab to bring my toolbox window into the foreground.
Click on File and select New to create a new image and we get the default value of width as 3400 and 1200 for height.
So I have three images of 1000 by 1000 and 100 pixels border between them.
Let's see how that works out.
For getting this image into the new image, I drag the 'Background' layer of this image from toolbox to my new image here and you get here 'Background copy'.
This was my left most image, so I rename it as "left" and I press return/Enter after typing.
So this image should be on the left side.
And the next image should be on right side, so I pull the image in the same way and name it accordingly "right".
And this is the third image and this will become my central window, so I pull this image over to the new image and rename this layer as "center".
I make the "right" and "central" layers invisible and now I want to scale the "left" layer a bit down and when I zoom down a bit to say 10%, you can see the borders of this layer and now the full frame of the image can be seen.
And now I select the Move tool so that I can move this image and adjust a bit.
The image is not moving because I have selected the center layer.
So, I select the left layer and move it and position the bottle.
I want to scale down this layer a bit, so I select the Scale tool from the toolbox and go to the tool info. and click on aspect ratio and in Preview I choose the Image option.
And now, I click into the layer, and pull the info window aside and reduce it from the corner.
I think more or bit less.
I can grab this image and I can position it where I want to and I think I should have put some guidelines on here.
So, I zoom into the image by 100% and go to the top left corner.
Now I pull the rulers down here for guidelines.
I wondered why I couldn’t move a ruler and here is an option Move the active layer. By selecting it I can move the active layer.
It's a nice option to protect the layers and I select the size of the frame as 100 on the right side and I go down and I set it 1100 and on right side I set it as 1100.
This is the frame for my image.
Shift + Ctrl + E gives me the whole image and now I select the active layer option.
And in Zoom Ratio, I select 10%.
I think, I should select 13% and that's enough.
I click on Scale tool and keep the aspect ratio and pull this Scale window out of the frame.
Now I scale this image.
Now I have the frame to look where I want to place this image.
And I think I should make it a bit smaller because I want to have the shades of glass here, in the image.
Now I click on Scale and I get my scaled image.
For getting the frame around the image, I just add a layer mask.
And I make my layer mask Black i.e full transparency.
And just click on Add.
So, now I select a rectangle inside the borders here and fill the rectangle with white.
I pull the white colour over here and you can see that the bottle becomes visible and for completing the frame here, I just zoom into it.
And I will paint with white with irregular strokes on the layer mask.
To do that, I select the Brush tool, go to the dialog here and I select here a soft brush for painting.
Before painting, I have to de-select my selection by pressing Shift + Ctrl + A and now I can start painting with white.
White is selected.
Now I paint with white here around and you see while I am painting white on the layer mask, I am revealing the image below.
And the painting is irregular but it's ok.
Now, I am selecting a different brush and I think this is better.
I get a fuzzy corner.
I should zoom into the image 100% so that you can see it.
I get kind of fuzzy border here and I will make it a bit more fuzzy in a moment by painting twice above it.
And now you can see that the border is getting a little bit more irregular.
Perhaps this is not the right tool here but you can use different tools and now I want to sharpen  this image.
You can check out that I am still working in the layer mask.
You can check it here.
The layer mask is selected with white here.
So, click on Filters, Blur, Gaussian Blur and I select high blur count here and I think that's ok.
And now I have really fuzzy border here around.
So let's look at the  full image.  Shift + Ctrl + E.
I have the 1st part of my triptych and I do the others in the same way.
I have finished with the other images and you can see here I have over painted over the rulers and I can do that here too.
Now I want to remove the rulers and new way of doing that is to go to the Image, Image Guides and here I can remove all guides.
And I found out that I can do a New Guide  here and select the position numerically.
Its wonderful to have this options.
The GIMP has so many options that you cant remember all of them.
Go to View and de-select Layer Boundary.
I want to have this bottle a bit more up into the corner.
I think there is bit more space here and little bit less here.
I think the "right" and the "center" image are here at the right corner.
But I think this bottle should go up there.
So, I will go out of full screen mode,
I de-select the "center" and the "right" layer and concentrate on the "left" layer.
Now I need the rulers for guidance.
So click on Image, Guides, New Guide and type in Horizontal position 100.
Again go to Image, Guides, New Guide and select vertical position as 100.
And now I select my Move tool. Go to the options, select Move the active layer and I just move this up here.
I think I have made a mistake, so I undo the step by pressing Ctrl + z and here you can see that the mask is selected.
I want to move the layer.
So, now I select the image and I just pull it up and the mask moves with it.
I found no way to lock the mask but I can correct that.
I select the layer mask and pull the layer mask back to my corner here.
And now this image is finished with the help from Jeson in New York.
No, this image isn't finished.
The thing I normally don't forget but I always forget when I am recording because I have to think about such lot of other things than just making my image.
I have again forgotten to save it.
Save it as jaegermeister.xcf, xcf contains all the layer information and i will cut out all the stuff about rescaling for the web.
You will find a link to this file in the show notes at meetthegimp@org and if you want to leave a comment then please do that.

Hello and welcome to this overview spoken tutorial on Biogas.
In this tutorial, we will learn about the 'Biogas' spoken tutorial series  and the content available in various tutorials in this series.
This series can be segregated into 3 different sections.
The first section explains: various benefits of using biogas for cooking
the generation of biogas using bio-waste, available in the house and farms the finance options available for the construction of a biogas plant.
The second section explains  the construction of various parts of a biogas plant and is particularly useful for masons.
The third section explains:  How biogas is actually generated The amount of bio-waste to be fed into the Biogas plant
Common troubleshooting information and Periodic repair and maintenance tasks to be done on the biogas plant.
There are many models of biogas plant such as-  KVIC model, Janata model, Pragati model
Deenbandhu model, Ganesh model,
the floating drum plant made of prefabricated reinforced concrete compound units
and the floating drum plant made of fiberglass reinforced polyester.
In this series, we have followed the Deenbandhu model, to construct a 2 cubic metres biogas plant.
The very first tutorial in this series, explains what is biogas and the various benefits of using biogas.
Here is a glimpse of the tutorial.
The next tutorial will help us to understand how biogas is generated using household bio-waste,  animal dung and toilet waste.
The next tutorial is an introduction to the various finance options available.
It will help us to know how: We can avail loan from private or government banks to build our Biogas plant and  avail subsidy from the government, later.
Here is a glimpse of the tutorial.
This set of tutorials are a part of section 1 of the Biogas series.
The next tutorial will help us to know- the choice of land for the biogas plant,
the land dimensions and the materials required for the construction.
The next tutorial will explain how to dig the pit and lay the foundation for the biogas plant.
Let’s have a look at this tutorial.
The next tutorial will explain how to construct the frame of the dome of the biogas plant with steel rods and chicken mesh.
Here is a glimpse of the tutorial.
The next tutorial will explain how to build the walls of the slurry tank.
Let me play this tutorial now.
In the next tutorial, we will learn how to construct the mixing tank.
Here is a glimpse of the tutorial.
In the next tutorial, we will learn how to assemble the biogas plant.
Let’s have a look at this tutorial.
This set of tutorials are part of section 2 of Biogas series and are particularly useful for the masons.
Now, we come to the next tutorial in this series - Maintenance and repair.
It will help us to know the various maintenance and repair activities related to the biogas plant.
This tutorial is a part of section 3 of the Biogas series.
Section 2 and section 3 tutorials will be most useful for masons to learn how to  construct the Biogas plant on their own
and also carry out routine maintenance on the Biogas plant.
They can  refer to these tutorials many times and become experts in the construction of Biogas plants.
This series is also useful to those masons who want to start a biogas plant consulting agency.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt about the overview of the Biogas plant series.
Please refer spokentutorial.org for the detailed tutorials on each topic mentioned above.

Hello and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Styles and CSS in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
We will also learn about CSS
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or Text Editor and a Web Browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML 5
gedit Text Editor and  Firefox web browser
However you may, use any other editor or  web browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
Styles allows us to define the presentation of the HTML elements.
Styles in HTML can be defined in 3 ways:
Inline attribute for the tags
Let us look at them one by one.
Style is an attribute that specifies the style of an element.
For eg: font-family, font-size, colour, etc.
style attribute decides how the content will be displayed.
Once the style attribute is declared for a tag, it will override the existing property.
This is the syntax.
We can add more properties with the help of a semi-colon, as shown here.
We will open our MyFirstPage.html, which we created earlier.
The same is available in the Code Files link.
Earlier in this series, we had defined the style attribute for the body tag.
Switch to the folder where the file is saved.
Right-click on the filename and open in the web browser.
Observe that the background color of the page is set to sky-blue.
Switch to the text editor.
Now let us change the color from sky-blue to yellow.
We will also add one more style property called text align.
Now next to the word yellow, type-
Save the file.
Observe that the background color has changed from sky-blue to yellow.
The style attributes, background color and text align are defined for body tag.
Hence, they will be applied to all the content within the body.
Now let us set the text align attribute for the first paragraph tag.
Locate the line Mumbai Farmer’s Market.
After the title type: space style equal to within double quotes text hyphen align colon left
Then switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Earlier we had center aligned the whole content inside the body section.
But now, the style attribute defined within the p tag overrides the earlier properties.
This is how the inline style attribute works.
Another method to define the styles is by using the style tag.
It defines the styles for the whole document.
We can have many style tags for a single document.
It has to be declared inside the head section.
It has both start and end tags.
This is the syntax for the style tag
We can add styles for multiple tags
Let me switch back to the editor window to try this.
I will delete the style attribute which I had written for the body tag.
And also delete the style attribute for the paragraph tag.
Then in head section, after the title tag line, press Enter and type the following code.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Observe the changes in the displayed content.
Let us switch to our editor once again and add some more examples.
In the style tag, type following code
After this, save the file.
Now go to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice that the content inside both the paragraph tags appear left aligned.
This is because the alignment for paragraph tag is set globally for this document.
Now let us change the style for the first paragraph tag.
Switch to the editor.
Now the content within the first paragraph tag appears center aligned.
This is because the inline style attribute overrides the global style property.
Some of the common style properties are
color to set the font color
font-family to set the font
font-size to set the font size
text-align for text alignment
Try these out by yourself.
Now we will learn about the external style sheets.
External style sheets are defined with the help of CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
It is a file in which we can define the styles for multiple html pages
CSS file will not have any html code
We have to include the CSS file in the head section with the help of link tag
To learn more about CSS, please visit our website
Now let’s see a small demo on how to work with CSS files.
For this demonstration, I have already created a CSS file named mystyle.css
The same is available in the Code Files link.
You can see only the style definitions which we have seen in the previous example.
In our html file, remove the style defined within the style tags.
Also remove the inline style for the first paragraph tag.
Now save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice that now our page is displayed without any styles.
Now in our html file under head section, after the title tag line, let us include the css file.
Make sure that your html and css files are kept in the same folder.
If the css file is in a different folder, then mention the full path for the file inside the code.
Example.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Now the new style attributes are applied to our page.
Let’s make some changes to the css.
Switch to the mystyle.css file
Now change the alignment of the body to left and remove the paragraph alignment as well.
Save the file and switch to the browser.
Refresh the page and observe the output.
This is how the styles works in HTML and CSS.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about
Style as a tag
Including a CSS file within an HTML code.
As an assignment
Remove the inline style for body tag
Create the following internal style in the head section
Set the body background color as “Khaki” and centre align the text
Set the alignment of paragraph tag to “left”

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Introduction to Mozilla Firefox.
What is Mozilla Firefox?
Why Firefox?
Versions, System Requirements, Download and Install Firefox, Visit a website.
"Mozilla Firefox" or simply "Firefox" is a free, open source web browser.
It is the default web browser for Ubuntu Linux, serving as a window to the Internet.
It allows you to view the Internet web-pages and navigate through the web pages.
It also searches for web pages using search engines such as Google, Yahoo Search or Bing.
Firefox has been developed by volunteer programmers at the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization.
Visit 'mozilla.org' for detailed information on Mozilla.
Firefox works on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux Operating Systems.
Some examples of other popular web browsers for Ubuntu are 'Konqueror', 'Google Chrome' and 'Opera'.
Firefox makes browsing better by bringing together speed, privacy and latest technologies.
It has a variety of features such as tabbed windows, built-in spell checking, pop-up blocker, integrated web search, Phishing protection.
Firefox provides faster web browsing with rapid rendering of graphics, improved page loading.
It also offers a variety of security and privacy options against fraudulent websites, spyware and viruses, trojans or other malware.
And it offers customization by way of add-ons and thousands of easy-to-install themes created by users.
Here are the System Requirements to run Firefox on Linux OS such as -Fedora, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian and SUSE.
You will need the following libraries or packages to run Firefox on Ubuntu 10.04.
GTK+ 2.10 or higher
GLib 2.12 or higher
libstdc++ 4.3 or higher
Pango 1.14 or higher
X.Org 1.7 or higher.
And the recommended hardware are Pentium 4 or above with 512MB of RAM and 200MB of hard drive space.
For complete information on System requirements, visit the Firefox website shown on the screen.
Let us now download and install Mozilla Firefox by visiting the official website at 'mozilla.com' as shown on the screen.
Here, we can always find the latest version of Firefox.
Or we can click on the all Systems and Languages link, below the green area, for more options.
Notice that Mozilla offers Firefox in over 70 languages.
Here, we can download various localized versions such as Hindi or Bengali.
We can also choose the operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux by clicking on the various icons.
In Ubuntu Linux, first select the location to save the file. By default, the Downloads directory in your 'Home page' folder is selected.
Now you can select the Save File option and click on the OK button, appearing in the pop-up window.
This will save Firefox archive to the Downloads directory, under the Home directory.
Open a 'Terminal' Window and go to your Downloads directory by typing the following command: cd ~/Downloads.
Extract the contents of the downloaded file by typing the following command: tar xjf firefox-7.0.1.tar.bz2
This will start extracting the files required to run Firefox 7.0.
In the Terminal Window, go to the Firefox directory by typing the following command: cd firefox
This will take you to the Firefox directory.
To launch the Firefox browser, type the following command: ./firefox and press the Enter key.
Alternately, you can launch Firefox by using the following command when your current directory is not the home directory.
~/Downloads/firefox/firefox
We will see how to set up the default homepage later.
For now, as an example, let us go to 'Rediff.com' website that has the latest news and information.
In the Address bar, below the menu bar, type: www.rediff.com.
The content on the home page of 'Rediff.com' website is displayed.
Now, from this page, we can navigate to the various links to view contents in those pages.
Let us click on the first link below the Headlines tab.
This is how we can visit websites using Firefox and then navigate to various pages from there.
In future tutorials, we will learn more about the Firefox interface and various other features.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Viewing and Printing a spreadsheet.
In this tutorial we will learn to
View spreadsheets and
Print spreadsheets in LibreOffice Calc.
We’ll first learn about the various viewing options in LibreOffice Calc.
There are basically two widely used viewing options in Calc - Normal and Page Break.
The Normal option displays how the spreadsheet will look when printed.
The Page break option displays the spreadsheet data in different pages when the data is large.
It helps us to organise and arrange data to fit within the pages we want to print.
Open the Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
This file has been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Make a copy and then use it for practising.
Notice that some part of the text is not readable inside column B.
If we print as it is, that text will be truncated in the print.
Place the cursor on the right edge on column header B.
Notice that the cursor changes into a double-sided arrow.
Now click and hold the left mouse button.
Drag a little towards the right side as shown to increase the width of column B.
Now, we can see all the text of column B clearly.
To access the Normal View, click on View menu in the menu bar and then on Normal.
This is the default view in Calc
To access the Page Break option, click on the View menu in the menu bar and then on Page Break.
For the better visibility I'm zooming in.
We can see a watermark named as Page 1 and Page 2 displayed.
Let’s go back to the Normal view on the Calc window.
Notice a vertical dotted line passing between Date and Account columns.
This indicates the right page margin.
Scroll down until you see a horizontal dotted line.
In my case the dotted line is passing between row number 50 and 51.
In your case it may vary.
This indicates the bottom page margin.
Within these margins, we can see how much data of our spreadsheet fits within a single page.
Scroll the page back up to the top.
Now let's copy our existing data and paste it below.
First click on cell A1.
All the cells have been selected.
Now right-click anywhere on the selected cells and then click on the Copy option.
Click anywhere outside the selection area to deselect the cells.
Now I will scroll down to row number 51.
You should scroll down to the row number where your bottom page margin is seen.
Right click on cell A51 and then click on the paste option
Click anywhere outside the selection area to deselect the cells.
Scroll up and press the Escape key to remove the dotted line selection.
Now click on the View menu and the Page Break option.
Let us zoom out for better visibility.
Scroll the page down and up to see the page breaks.
We can see a new page with the watermark Page 2 below Page 1.
We can also see Page 4 below Page 3 adjacent to these pages.
Click on View menu and go back to the Normal view again.
Apart from both these options, one can also view a spreadsheet in full screen mode.
Click on the View menu in the menu bar and then on Full Screen option.
The Full screen mode is useful for editing spreadsheets.
It’s also useful for projecting them on a projector.
To exit the full screen mode, press either the Full Screen button or the Escape key.
We are back to the Normal view on the Calc window.
Click on Format in the menu bar and then on Page option.
The Page Style:Default dialog box opens.
There are various tabs here.
Click on the Page tab.
There are various settings here for Paper Format, Margins and Layout settings.
Under Paper Format, notice that the Orientation field has the Portrait option pre-selected.
Look at the preview area to see the page orientation.
Now, click on the Landscape option.
Look at the preview area to see how the page orientation has changed.
Click on the Portrait option once again.
Next, click on the Sheet tab.
Under Page Order, we see that Top to bottom, then right is selected.
Recall, that’s exactly how our pages are displayed in the Page break view.
Let’s click on Left to right, then bottom and click on the OK button at the bottom right.
Click on View in the menu bar and then on Page break option.
Observe the change in the page numbering.
Let’s go back to the Normal view.
Now, let’s learn to use the Zoom option.
The easiest way to zoom or magnify a spreadsheet is to use the Zoom slider.
This is located at the bottom right corner of the Calc window.
We can use the plus and minus icons on either side of the slider, like this.
Or we can drag the Zoom head to increase or decrease the magnification, like this.
Let's learn another way of zooming.
Click on the View menu in the menu bar and click on Zoom.
A few more options are displayed in the context menu.
Here select Optimal View.
Now, we get the most comfortable magnified view of the spreadsheet.
Again click on View menu in the menu bar and then on the Zoom option.
This time from the context menu we’ll click on the Zoom option.
Zoom & View Layout dialog box opens up.
It has 2 headings namely - Zoom Factor and View Layout.
The Zoom Factor sets the magnification in which to display the spreadsheet.
Under Zoom Factor we see many options.
Click on Fit width and height and then on the Ok button at the bottom right.
This view fits the spreadsheet across the entire width and height of the page.
Scroll down and up, it displays many pages at a time.
Open the Zoom & View Layout dialog box again.
Next option is Fit Width.
This fits the page to its width.
100% view will display the page in its actual size.
Try out these 2 options on your own.
Next we have the most important zoom option called the Variable.
Here, we can type the zoom factor at which we want to view the spreadsheet.
For example, let’s type the value as 75% in the Variable field.
Observe how the text is zoomed.
Let's switch back to Optimal View for better visibility.
Next, we will learn about Print Preview.
Click on the Toggle Print Preview icon in the Standard toolbar.
The Print Preview bar appears when we view the spreadsheet in preview mode.
For the better visibility I'm enlarging the view.
It basically shows how the spreadsheet will look like, when it is printed.
Scroll down and up to see all the pages in the spreadsheet.
Notice that the Account column is going on to the next page.
Click on the Close Preview button at the top to exit the Toggle Print View.
Now select the columns C to H as shown here.
Place the cursor on the right edge on the column header H.
Notice that the cursor changes into a double-sided arrow.
Now click and hold the left mouse button
Drag a little towards the left side as shown to reduce the margins.
On doing so, all the columns from C to H get resized proportionally.
While doing so some data in the cells may look like a series of hashtags.
If so, resize the columns and zoom level in such a way that we are able to see the data again.
The data in the columns A to H. are now within the dotted boundary line of the page.
Again, click on the Toggle Print Preview icon in the Standard toolbar.
Now the data fits within two pages.
In this way we can adjust the data before printing, so that it looks neat and organised.
From this screen, one can proceed to printing the spreadsheet, by clicking the Print icon.
Click on the Close Preview button to close the preview.
We can also click on File menu in the menu bar and click on Print Preview.
Next, we will learn how to print our LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet.
First, ensure that the printer connection is configured correctly on your machine.
To directly print the entire spreadsheet, click on the Print icon in the Standard toolbar.
Alternatively, you can click on the File menu in the menu bar and then click on Print.
The Print dialog box appears on the screen.
There are 2 tabs with different settings in this dialog box.
We can either leave these as default or change the settings as per our printing requirement.
Under Printer drop-down, let’s select Print to File option.
This option is used predominantly to print the spreadsheet into PDF file format.
The button at the bottom of the dialog box says Print to File.
Choose the location to save and type a filename for the pdf.
This saves the file in PDF format.
Let’s learn about some more printing features.
Press Ctrl+P keys on the keyboard.
Under Printer, we will select our configured printer’s name.
Under Range and Copies, let’s set the Pages as 2 and Number of copies as 3.
So we are printing 3 copies of Page 2 of our spreadsheet.
Click on the OK button at the bottom right of the dialog box, to start the printing.
If our printer is configured correctly, the pages and copies we mentioned will now get printed.
Now let’s see how to print certain parts of data by selecting some cells.
Let’s select the data from A1 to C8 as shown here.
Press Ctrl+P keys on the keyboard.
In the Print dialog box, click on the dropdown besides From which option.
From the available options select Print selected cells.
Observe that only selected cells are displayed in the Print preview section.
Now, click on the OK button at the bottom right to start the printing.
Next, we will see how to access other Print options.
Click on the Tools menu in the menu bar and then click on Options.
Click on the arrow beside LibreOffice if not already expanded and then click on Print.
A dialog box, giving us several options to select from.
I will keep all the default settings and then click on the OK button at the bottom.
These settings are now valid for all prints from LibreOffice Calc, in the future.
Save and Close the file

Welcome to this tutorial on   Introduction to R script.
In this tutorial, you will learn
How to work with an R script in RStudio
To understand this tutorial, you should know basic commands of R.
If not, please locate the relevant tutorials on R on this website.
This tutorial is recorded on
Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04
R version 3.2.3
RStudio version 1.1.456
Install R version 3.2.0 or higher.
An R script is a plain text file in which you save your R code
Script allows you to show your work to others, and also reproduce and modify the results
Before you begin please create a folder named myProject on Desktop.
I have already created this folder on my Desktop.
I shall now save all my scripts and data sets in this folder.
Later, I shall set this folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to RStudio.
We will close these two tabs named Untitled1 and R packages available.
Click on the small cross symbol next to these tabs
We will now create a new R script.
In the top left corner of RStudio, click on the green plus sign.
Now from the dropdown menu, select R Script.
A new R script appears in the Source window.
You can also create a new R script by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N together.
Let us save this R script first.
In the top left corner of the screen, click on the File option.
Then click on Save to save the script.
Select the directory where you want to save your R script.
I am saving the script in the folder myProject on my Desktop, with the name myfirstscript.
Finally, click on the Save button.
Now you can see that the file is named as myfirstscript.R.
RStudio automatically adds dot R at the end of the filename.
Now, let us write some lines of code in the script file myfirstscript.R.
We will create a vector named testSample with one two three four as its elements.
We have already learned how to create vectors earlier in this series.
In the Source window, type testSample space less than symbol.
You may also use equal sign in place of less than symbol followed by hyphen.
In the Source window, to the left of the checkbox Source on Save,  click on the Save icon Or, press Ctrl+S together to save the file.
We will now use the print function to display the values in testSample vector.
In the Source window, type p r i
RStudio automatically starts suggesting different functions.
You can navigate this list of functions by using the up (↑) and down (↓) arrow keys on the keyboard.
To select a particular function, just press Enter.
Finish typing print testSample in parentheses and press Enter.
Now let’s save the file and run it with these two lines only.
Now, we maximize the Source window.
In the top right corner of the Source window, click on the Source button.
You can see the line-by-line execution of the script in the Console.
You can also run the script by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter together.
For this, you need to first click in the script window.
Now let’s declare a variable firstVar with value of ten in the Source window.
Type firstVar with capital V space equal sign space 10 and press Enter.
Please note that R language is case-sensitive.
We will now use the print function to show the value of firstVar.
In the Source window, type print.
I am typing only p r i n but the options appear and I select print from there.
Now in parentheses, start typing firstVar.
RStudio shows firstVar; press Enter to select it.
Press Enter to go to the next line.
Now let’s declare another variable secondVar with value of fifteen.
In the Source window, type secondVar space equal sign space 15 and press Enter.
Now, as shown before, type print secondVar in parentheses to show its value and press Enter
We can add comments to our code by using # hash symbol followed by our comment.
Type hash symbol space Creating an R script before the declaration of testSample vector.
R interprets each line of code.
Please make sure that your comment and the first line of code appear in separate lines.
Now, let’s comment the line print(secondVar).
To do that, first click on this line.
Then from the top menu bar of RStudio, click on the Code option.
From the dropdown menu, click on the Comment/Uncomment Lines option.
This option helps us to comment as well as uncomment a line.
On doing so, we see a hash symbol with space.
For now, we will uncomment print(secondVar) and save our script.
Delete # hash symbol at the beginning of this line.
Now let’s run the script file.
In the top right corner of the Source window, click on the Source button.
Now maximize the Console.
The line-by-line execution of the script is shown in the Console window.
The sample vector [1 2 3 4] is printed.
The values of two variables, 10 and 15 are printed.
We will clear the Console by clicking on the broom icon.
Now, we minimize the Console window.
Now let’s move ahead.
Suppose, we want to run only a block of code after print(testSample) from the file myfirstscript.R.
First, select or highlight the block of code, starting from firstVar equals 10 to the end.
Then in the top right corner of the Source window, click on the Run button with an arrow.
Now you can see the output of only the highlighted part of the code in the Console window.
The output shows the values of two variables, 10 and 15 only.
You can also run a particular block by highlighting it and pressing Ctrl+Enter together.
We will clear the Console window by clicking on the broom icon.
Now let us create another R script.
Use Ctrl+Shift+N to open a new script.
Save this script in the same folder myProject with the name mysecondscript.
Now let’s learn how to load myfirstscript.R into mysecondscript.R.
Go to myfirstscript.R and run it by clicking on the Source button.
In the Console window, scroll up to locate the source for this script.
Copy it without the symbol.
Now let’s get back to our new script mysecondscript.R
Paste what we have just copied, at the top of the script mysecondscript.R
We can press Enter after comma for better visibility.
Next, write one more line to ensure that the execution is from this script only.
In the Source window, type print and then the following words in parentheses.
In double quotes, Script space loaded.
Save the script.
Let us clear the Console again by clicking on the broom icon.
Now run the script by pressing  Ctrl+Shift+Enter   together.
Maximize the Console window.
You can see the output in the   Console   window and verify the results.
Now, we minimize the   Console   window.
We have learned
How to create, save and run an R script
We now suggest an assignment.
Create a script and save it on Desktop as testscript.R
Load myfirstscript.R in this script and run it.

In this tutorial, we will see the salient features of SBHS,
block diagram explanation of SBHS.
The Single-board Heater System is abbreviated as SBHS.
It is a micro-controller based lab-in-a-box temperature control setup.
The setup has been designed to cater to the needs of undergraduate & postgraduate control courses.
It revolves around the concepts of electronics
Serial port communication
Micro-controller programming
Data acquisition interface
Control theory.
These concepts serve as the basic foundation for its development.
Next we shall talk about the salient features of SBHS.
SBHS is a 3000 rupee device with its hardware design and codes released as open source.
However, please note that the actual price during purchase may vary.
An open source software is used to interface SBHS.
More details can be sought from: sbhs dot os hyphen hardware dot in.
Moreover, it has a small time constant of around 1 minute.
Hence, one can do realistic experiment in 10 minutes.
This setup is also available for remote access under Virtual labs project.
One can access it remotely and get a feel for it.
Later, the user can buy it or assemble it and set it up as a lab at a college or at home.
Figure shows the picture of Single Board Heater System.
It has an SMPS to generate 12 Volt regulated DC power supply,
a metal blade and a heater coil is situated below this metal support,
a computer fan, a display,
USB and RS232 ports.
We would now see the block diagram of SBHS.
The figure shows the block diagram of SBHS.
It consists of  power supply,
8-bit micro-controller,
display, fan,
Heater Assembly, temperature sensor,
instrumentation amplifier and associated circuitry,
ISP, serial and USB ports.
We would now see a brief explanation of the various blocks in SBHS.
First, we will see the power Supply.
The power supply is basically a 12V 400 watt SMPS.
This 12V supply is used directly but most of the circuitry requires 5V supply.
Hence, separate voltage regulators are used wherever necessary.
Also, to avoid any ambiguous temperature readings due to power supply fluctuations, the voltage regulators for systems and sensors are kept separate.
Next is Micro-controller.
An 8-bit ATmega16 micro-controller is used.
Micro-controller plays a very important role.
It controls every single hardware present on the SBHS, directly or indirectly.
It executes various tasks like setting up communication between computer and SBHS
controlling the amount of current passing through the heater coil
controlling fan speed
reading the temperature value
displaying parameter values and various other necessary operations.
Next comes the heater and fan.
The heater assembly consist of a metal plate placed about 3.5 mm away from a nichrome wire coil.
When current passes through the coil, the coil gets heated.
This heat is transferred to the metal plate through convection, increasing its temperature.
The fan used is a small regular computer fan.
It is used for cooling the heated metal plate.
Due to some tried and tested reasons, it is placed below the heater.
Next comes the Driver block.
This is nothing but a device which varies the amount of power delivered to the fan and heater.
MOSFETS are used for the same.
MOSFETS are operated as per the commands given by the micro-controller.
These MOSFETS are actually switched at some PWM frequency.
Now we will talk about the Temperature sensor.
AD590 is the Temperature sensor used for sensing the temperature of the heated plate.
The output of this sensor is in micro ampere per kelvin.
The operating temperature ranges from -55 to 150 degree Celsius.
Moreover, it does not require any further process of linearization.
Next we will see Instrumentation amplifier.
Instrumentation amplifier is used for signal conditioning of the signal generated by AD590.
It also provides good input impedance for the temperature sensor.
Hence, the signal generated by the sensor is not attenuated during signal conditioning.
The Display and Indicators block.
Display constitutes of a 16x2 LCD display.
This means that the display is capable of displaying two lines of 16 characters each.
No separate controller is required since it has its own in-built controller.
It is used for displaying various parameters like temperature, fan, heater and machine ID (MID) .
It is operated in 4-bit mode.
Indicators include various on-board LEDs.
Next we have Serial Voltage Level Converter block.
It is used for conversion of signals from serial to TTL and vice versa.
Next we have USB to Serial Converter block.
It is used for conversion of signals from USB to serial and vice versa.
Next we have USB and RS232 blocks.
It is used to connect the USB and RS232 cable.
Last we have the ISP block.
ISP stands for "In-System Programming".
It is actually a 10 pin male connector.
Through this, we can program the micro-controller with the help of proper programming device.
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on Introduction to Single Board Heater System.
In this spoken tutorial, we saw the  salient features and  block diagram explanation of SBHS.
The various blocks briefly explained include: Power Supply,
micro-controller,  heater and fan,
driver, temperature sensor,
instrumentation amplifier, display,
USB & RS232 ports,   ISP.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Warli art for Textile design using Inkscape.
In this tutorial we will learn to create a Warli pattern design for borders, Repeat patterns using cloning
Let us open Inkscape. First let us design the warli pattern.
Go to File.  Click on Document Properties.
Select the Rectangle tool. Draw a rectangle covering the whole canvas and color it blue.
Click on the Ellipse tool.  Draw a circle outside the canvas.
On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 15.
Change its color to orange. Move it to the bottom of the canvas as shown.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the circle.
On the Tool controls bar change the width and height to 7.
Move the duplicated circle to the bottom left of the original circle.
This is the head of the warli figure.
Next, Go to Object menu.  Click on Symbols options.
A list of geometrical shapes appears. Click on the triangle shape and drag it to the canvas.
On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 20.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the triangle. Press V to flip it.
Arrange the triangles below the head, as shown.
This is the body of the warli figure.
Select the Rectangle tool.  And draw a line in between the head and the body.
Now the neck of the figure is drawn.
Next let us draw the hands and legs.  For this, we will select the Bezier tool.
Draw hands and legs as demonstrated.
Select both the hands and legs. Using the Picker tool on the Fill and Stroke, pick the orange color from the body of the warli art.
Change the Stroke width to 2.
Now select all the elements and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
Now the warli figure is ready. Let us now create a round pattern with this warli figure.
Let me make a copy of this figure and keep it to one side, before proceeding further.
Now select the original warli art. Now, click once more on the figure, to make the anchor point visible.
Click on the anchor point and move it down as demonstrated.
Now go to Edit.  Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones.
In the dialog box, under Symmetry tab, the option in the drop-down menu should be Simple translation.
Then go to Shift tab.  Under Per column option, change the X value to -100.
Next go to Rotation tab.  Change the Per row and Per column parameters of the angle to 30.
At the bottom, let the number of rows be 1. Change the number of columns to 12.
Then click on Create button.
Observe the round pattern that is created on the canvas.
Let us now try some other options.
Under Rotation tab Change the Per row and Per column parameters of the angle to 10.Click on Create.
Observe the created pattern on the canvas. To make it a complete round pattern change the number of Rows to 40.
Click on Create. Observe the changes on the canvas.
In such a way, you can change the Rotation parameters to get the patterns in different angles.
Select the round pattern and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
We now have a lovely warli art on our canvas.
Let's move it to one side, like this.
Now, let's try some other options.
Next, using the Create Spirals tool, draw a fairly large spiral on the canvas, as shown.
Click on the Selector tool.  Select the single warli figure and place it at the centre of the spiral, like this.
Now click on Raise to top option on the Tool Controls bar.
Then, select the spiral too.
Click on Extensions menu and choose Generate from path option.
In the sub-menu that appears, select Scatter.
A dialog box opens on the screen. Here, check the Follow path orientation checkbox.
In Space between copies, we will say 5.
Ensure that - Original pattern will be is set to Moved and Duplicate the pattern before deformation is also checked.
Click on Apply button and close the dialog box.
Let's move the spiral warli pattern aside a little to expose the spiral path.  Now, select the spiral path and delete it.
This is how one can draw a beautiful spiral warli pattern in Inkscape.
Likewise, we can create many other lovely warli patterns.
Next, let us learn how to create a border.
Go to Object menu and click on Symbols.  Click on the triangle shape and drag it to the canvas.
On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 30.
Now move the triangle to the top left of the canvas.
I want to create a row pattern using the triangle.
Go to Edit. Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones. All the previous settings are visible here..
In the Rotation tab, change the Angle parameter of Per Row and Per Column to 0.
In the Shift tab, under Per column option, change the X value to 0.
Lastly, change the Column to 35, at the bottom, as shown here. Then click on Create button.
Observe the row pattern that is created on the canvas.
Select all the triangles and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the triangle pattern. Press V to flip it.
Now move the pattern to the bottom of the canvas.
Our warli pattern is now ready. We can use this pattern as border in various textile design assignments.
This is how it looks on a kurti.
We can use this as a pillow cover design, also.
And this warli art looks great on a cloth bag, too.
So, in a similar way, you can create various textile patterns using the warli art form.
In this tutorial we have learnt to create Warli pattern for textiles, patterns using cloning
Here is an assignment for you. Create a peacock pattern design
The video available at the following link summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project. Pls watch it.
The Spoken Tutorial Project Team conducts workshops and gives certificates for those who pass an online test. For more details, please write to us.
This is Arthi, Shital and Saurabh from IIT Bombay, signing off. Thanks for joining.
To follow this tutorial, you should have:
We also require some external devices such as:
Pin 1 is the ground pin represented by GND.
Command register is used for placing the command to be displayed.
Extension pin which needs to be soldered to LCD so that we can connect easily to the breadboard.
Then connect it again.
In the Menu bar, click Help and then Reference.
Switch back to the Arduino IDE.
This program will print on a 16 by 2 configuration LCD.
We didn't use any code in the void loop.
We can see there are many more functions such as scrollDisplayLeft, scrollDisplayRight  etc.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Do the following assignment.
This tutorial has been contributed by FOSSEE and Spoken Tutorial Project, IIT Bombay.
Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer – Using Find and Replace feature and the AutoCorrect feature in Writer.
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:
Spellcheck AutoCorrect
Alternately, click on the button in the standard toolbar.
You see a dialog-box appears with a  Search for and a Replace with field.
So, type "Ramesh" in the Search for field.
Now, click on Find All.
You see that all the places where "Ramesh" is written in our document, get highlighted.
For example, we want to replace  "Ramesh" with "MANISH" in our document.
It has options like Backwards which searches for the text from bottom to top, Current selection only which searches for text inside the selected portion of the text.
Spellcheck looks for spelling mistakes in words and gives you the option of adding an unknown word to the user dictionary.
The spell check feature is distinct for each language.
Under the option User interface, make sure that the default option is set as English USA.
Below that, click on the down-arrow in the Locale setting field and then click on the English USA option.
Now, under the heading Default languages for documents, the default language set in the Western field is English India.
Since English India may not have the dictionary required by spell check, we will change the language to English USA.
So, click on the down-arrow in the Western field and click on the English USA option.
So, we are now ready to see how the spell check feature works for the language- English USA.
So, let us click on the AutoSpellCheck button in the toolbar if it is not enabled.
In our 'resume.odt' file, under "Mother’s Occupation", we shall type a wrong spelling for "housewife" in the sentence as "husewife" and press the space bar.
Now place the cursor on the word "husewife" and click on the Spelling and Grammar icon in the standard toolbar.
Let us now learn about another standard toolbar option called AutoCorrect.
'AutoCorrect' is found in the drop-down menu of the Format option in the menu bar.
AutoCorrect feature automatically corrects text as you write.
The corrections are made according to the options you have selected in the Options tab..
There are several AutoCorrect options like- Delete spaces at the end and beginning of paragraph, Ignore double spaces and many more.
So, let us see how they work through  an example.
In our "resume" file, we shall type some text with single spaces in between words at few places and double and triple spaces between words at other places.
Let us place the cursor after the name- MANISH. Now, press the space bar on the keyboard twice.
'AutoCorrect' also has the ability to replace a word or an abbreviation with a more significant or longer text.
For example, in our 'resume.odt' file, there might be a few set of words or word which are used repeatedly in the document.
Let's say we want to type the text- "This is a Spoken Tutorial Project" repeatedly in our document.
So, let us see how an abbreviation like stp gets automatically converted to "Spoken Tutorial Project".
Check that English USA is our language choice.
Now, in the Replace field, let us type the abbreviation which we want to replace as "stp".
You see that the entry is made in the replacement table.
Now, as soon as we write the text "This is a stp" and press the spacebar, you will notice that  the stp abbreviation gets converted to Spoken Tutorial Project.
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer.
AutoCorrect.
COMPREHENSIVE ASSIGNMENT-
Type the following text in Writer - "This  is a new document. The document deals with find and replace".
Now Find and Replace the word "document" in your text with the word "file".
Replace the word "text" in your document with the spelling "t x t".
Use English(USA) as your default language.
Using the AutoCorrect feature, create an abbreviation for the text: "This is LibreOffice Writer" as "TLW" and see its implementation.

And at the moment this is pretty much blank inside here.
And  the way we'll be doing this is - we'll first of all set up a variable with the directory of our images.
Okay, now the next bit is more complicated.
So, all we really need to do is now say echo $file  and what we might want to do is add a brto the end of that.
So, we'll need to get rid of these. So what I'll do is I'll say if '$file' doesn't equal 'dot' and - we need an AND here instead of an OR - and file doesn't equal 'dot dot'.
So what we'll do is I'll take away all of this and I'll just write some html code as an omni word.
Obviously, if you have images of all different sizes, you will want to put them all in the same size and then maybe have a hyper link to them, so you can click them to view them individually.
Okay, and then we'll have a break after each one.
So inside here, funnily enough, you might think  it's going to put 'file' but instead when you refresh this, you can see we've got a bunch of broken images.
So, that's basically it. There are more advanced ways of doing things, to lay them out, etc.
All right, then thanks a lot for watching.  This is Joshua Mathew, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project.
Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Elements, Tags and Attributes in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or Text Editor and a Web Browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML 5
gedit Text Editor and  Firefox web browser
However you may, use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
HTML document contains a set of elements.
Each element consists of some content between tags.
Some elements don't require any content.
These are called as Empty Elements.
Let us open our file MyFirstPage.html, which we created earlier in gedit Text Editor.
The same is available in the Code Files link.
We will now learn how elements are implemented.
In this code, each line is an element.
You can see that this element contains start and end tag along with the content.
See the first line DOCTYPE html
Notice that this element doesn't have an end tag or any content.
The whole program is an example of nested elements.
html tag is an element with a start and an end tag.
Next we will learn about tags.
The contents to be structured on the web are defined by tags
Tags are written in between angular brackets
Most of the tags will have a start and an end
Syntax of a tag is: tag name within angular brackets followed by the content and ending with forward slash tag name within angular brackets
Each end tag contains a “/” (forward slash) before the tag name.
There are some tags which don’t require an end tag
HTML tags are not case sensitive
However, it is advisable to use lower-case
Switch back to the editor window.
Notice here - each line of code contains a tag.
We have used various tags in this program.
Also notice that all the tags are written in lower-case.
Here in this line, we have used h1 – heading tag.
The name of the tag is written between the left and right angular brackets.
And here, the end tag is the same as the starting tag.
Let me add a few more lines of code to this program.
Press Ctrl and S to save this change.
I have written br – which is the break tag, without writing the end tag.
This tag provides a line break and it doesn't require an end tag.
Let us see the output on the browser.
Switch to the folder where the file is saved.
Right-click and open with your preferred web browser.
Observe the change in the content that is displayed.
Let’s switch back to the editor window.
In the break tag, I will put a forward slash after the tag name.
Save the file.
Switch back to the web browser and refresh the page.
There is no change in the output.
Now we will learn about tag attributes.
An attribute is additional information pertaining to an element.
It is written inside the starting tag.
Each attribute is declared by name – value pair separated by equal to symbol.
The syntax is: open angular bracket tag name space attribute name equal to attribute value close angular bracket followed by the content and ending with forward slash tag name within angular brackets
Values containing spaces have to be entered within a single or double quotes.
Multiple attributes can be specified with the help of the semicolon separator.
Here are some common attributes.
title: to display the tooltip
id: is the unique identifier of an element
class: to classify the elements in a similar manner, mostly for better presentation
style: to define a specific style for an element
Let us switch back to our editor to try some of these.
We will look at some basic attributes and how they work.
First we will add a sky-blue background to our webpage.
To do that, let’s set the background color using style attribute to the body tag.
So inside the body tag, type, style equal to within double quotes background hyphen color colon skyblue
The color value can also be declared in RGB or HTML notations.
The HTML Color notation for sky-blue is #87CEEB
We will learn more about style and it’s attributes in a later tutorial.
In our code, we will add one more attribute called title.
Inside the p – that is paragraph tag, type
Now save the file by pressing Ctrl and S keys.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
The background color of the page is now set to sky-blue.
Hover the mouse on the text “Buy the products directly from the farmers.”
Notice the tooltip - it says “Mumbai Farmer Market”.
This is how the attributes work.
Quotes are important while declaring the value of the attribute.
Notice here - The values of the attributes style and title, are mentioned within quotes.
Values that contain more than one word, can be declared within single or double quotes.
It is mandatory to close the quotes, else the attribute won't be applied.
Let’s try it out.
Delete the end quotes of the title attribute.
Save the file.
Then switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice that, the line - “Buy the products directly from the farmers” is missing now.
Switch back to the editor and undo the changes.
Now, let’s try something else.
Let’s change the Mumbai Farmer market to Mumbai Farmer's Market.
Save the file.
Then switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Notice the tooltip.
It says “Mumbai Farmer”, but inside the code we had written “Farmer's”
Let’s switch back to the code.
Instead of single quote, use double quote for the title’s value .
The standard rule is if we are using a particular quote inside the value, then use the other quote to declare the value.
Now save the file once again.
Then switch to the browser and refresh the page to see the output .
In this tutorial, we have learnt about-  Elements,  Tags: Pair tags and Self Closing Tags
Declaration of attributes
Set the background of the page to yellow.
Write two paragraphs with p tag.
Create a line break between the two paragraphs.
Set the title for the first paragraph as “It’s my first paragraph”.
Open the html page in a web browser and see the output.

Welcome to this tutorial on Interpolation Methods in QGIS.
In this tutorial, we will learn about Interpolation methods.
Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and
Here I am using
QGIS version 2.18
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with QGIS interface.
For the prerequisite tutorials in this series, please visit this website.
Data files required for this tutorial are provided in the Code files link.
Please download and extract the contents of the folder.
I have saved this folder on the Desktop.
Locate Air Stations.shp in the extracted folder.
This file shows meteorological stations located in Maharashtra.
Interpolation is a method to create continuous surface from discrete points.
Two methods of interpolation are available in QGIS.
Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and  Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)
Interpolation Plugin is used to create interpolated raster from Point layer.
Open the QGIS interface.
Here I have opened the QGIS interface.
Enable the interpolation plugin using Plugins menu as shown here.
Check the check-box for Interpolation plugin.

Hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and click on MH_Districts.shp.
Click on Open button on the Add vector layer dialog-box.
On the canvas we see map of Maharashtra state.
Locations of Air stations in each district are shown as point features.
Let us label these point features.
Right click on the Air Stations layer.
Click on Properties option to open Layer Properties dialog box.
Select the Labels option located on the left panel.
Click on the drop-down located at the top.
Select Show labels for this layer from the drop-down.
In the Label with drop-down select Air_Pollut.
Here you will find various options to modify the label style.
Choose the required style and click on OK button.
On the canvas, points with the labels will be displayed.
Open the attribute table for Air Stations.shp layer.
In the attribute table there are five columns.
In the 4th column, Nitrogen Oxides levels for every station is given.
We will interpolate Air Stations layer by the Nox attribute.
Here we will use IDW method for interpolation.
Inverse Distance Weighting method gives weights to sample points.
It is used for interpolating data such as temperature, rainfall, population etc.
Back to the QGIS interface.
Click on the Raster menu.
Click on the interpolation plugin.
Interpolation plugin dialog-box opens.

In this tutorial, we will cover Tables and Relationships in LibreOffice Base.
Here, we will learn about: * adding data to a Table.
Define and create relationships.
In the previous LibreOffice Base tutorial, we introduced Base, database basics and learnt how to create a database and a table.
During the course of the tutorial, we also created an example database called Library and created a 'Books' table as well.
In this tutorial, we will resume with the Library database and learn how to add data to a table.
For this, let us invoke the LibreOffice Base program.
For this, we will click on the Start button at the bottom left of the screen,
click on All programs, then click on LibreOffice Suite and LibreOffice Base.
Since we already created the 'Library' database in the last tutorial, this time we will just need to open it.
To do so, let us click on the open an existing database file option.
In the Recently Used drop-down box, our 'Library' database should be visible.
So now, click on the Finish button.
If you don't see it, we can click on the Open button in the centre to browse to the Windows directory where 'Library database' is saved.
Once found, click on the filename and click on the Open button.
Now, if 'LibreOffice Base' program is already open, we can open the 'Library database' from here.
By clicking on the File menu on the top and then clicking on Open.
We will browse the Windows directory where the 'Library' database file is saved.
Let's click on the file 'Library.odb' and click on the Open button at the bottom.
Now we are in the Library Database.
Let us click on the Tables icon in the Database list on the left panel.
Notice that the Books table appears in the Tables list on the right panel.
Let us now right-click on the Books table.
Notice the various options you can choose from here.
Let us now click on Open to add data to this table.
Alternately, we can also double-click on the table name to open it.
A new window opens with the title 'Books – Library – LibreOffice Base: Table Data View'.
Now we can start entering data into the Books table by typing in values directly into each cell.
Notice the Bookid column has 'AutoField'.
This means Base will assign ascending numbers automatically to each row of data that we insert.
Now, let us  input data into the cells, row by row, as shown on the screen.
So, here we have 5 rows of sample data in our table 'Books'.
Let us close the window by clicking the File menu on the top and then choosing Close.
Create a Members table that will store information about each member, for example- member name', and phone number.
Include the following three fields.
Member Id with Field type- Integer and make this the primary key.
Name with Fieldtype- Text,
Phone with Fieldtype- Text.
Okay, when you are done, this is how the Members table will look like.
Let us close this window.
Now let us add 4 sample members into the Members table now as shown on the screen ,
just the way we did for the Books table. <pause for 10 seconds>
Once done, let us close this window.
Now, let us go back to the main window and click on the Tables Icon again
and let us create the third table: Books Issued.
When done, the Books Issued table will have the following fields:
Issue Id, Field type Integer which will be the primary key,
Book Id, Field type-Integer,
Member Id, Field type-Integer,
Issue Date, Field type- Date,
Return Date, Field type-Date,
Actual Return Date, Field type- Date,
And Checked In, Field type- Yes/No Boolean.
Okay, we have created the Books Issued table.
And now, let us add the following sample data into it as you can see on the screen.
While this may not make absolute sense right now, we will soon understand what’s happening.
Now, we have the three tables in our Library database with sample data also.
Let us now learn about defining relationships in the database.
So, we created three tables to store three different sets of information.
Books, Members and Issue of Books to Members.
Now we also set up columns to uniquely identify each book, each member and each book issued in these three tables.
They are the Primary Keys.
One of the various advantages of a primary key is that it helps to establish relationships between tables.
But why do we need relationships?
Let us look at the Books Issued table. Here, we see the Book-Id and Member-Id fields.
They can have any value in the Books Issued table.
But, they will need to correspond to the same values as we have in the Books and Members tables respectively.
So if the book, Macbeth, has its 'Book Id' as 3 in the 'Books' table
then by using 3 in the 'Book Id' of the 'Books Issued' table, we will still be referring to the same book.
So, to explicitly connect these two tables, we will still need to link them someway.
Also, for example- How will you establish that 'Macbeth' was issued to Ravi Kumar on 2nd June 2011?
Or how will you ensure that a book is issued to only members of the library and not anyone else?
All of these can be achieved by setting up relationships which help interlink the data.
We will need to force Base to use values from the 'Books' table and the 'Members' table only, by linking the appropriate fields.
Let us see how.
In the 'LibreOffice Base' main window, let us click on Tools and then click on Relationships.
This opens a small pop-up window.
Here, we will select the top most table and click on the Add button and repeat for the other two tables also.
Now we see the three tables Books, Books Issued and Members in a line.
By clicking, dragging and dropping, let us introduce more space among the tables.
Now, let us click on the Book-Id in the Books table and drag and drop it on the Book Id in the Books Issued table.
Notice a line connecting these two field names. So there, we have set up one relationship!
Let us repeat the same for Member-Id.
Click on the Member-Id in the Members table and drag and drop it in the Books Issued table.
You can see that we just created two relationships.
And, this is how we establish relationships
And therefore interlink meaningful data stored in various tables in the relational database.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Tables and Relationships in LibreOffice.
To summarize, we learned how to: Add data to a table, Define and create relationships.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Getting started with functions.
In this tutorial, we will learn to,
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to use tuples.
First we will learn about functions.
A function is a portion of code within a larger program that performs a specific task.
Functions are useful in reusing the code and eliminate code redundancy.
Functions are also used to organise our code into manageable blocks.
Here is the syntax for defining the functions.
def is the keyword which defines the function name.
colon is used to mark the end of the function name.
docstring is the documentation string to describe what the function does.
Statement makes the function body and it must have 4 indentation level.
return statement is to return a value from the function and it is also indented by 4 spaces.
Now we will understand the functions with an example.
Consider a mathematical function f of x is equal to x squared.
Here x is a variable. f of x changes when x changes.
Let us define our function f of x.
The first line def f of x is used to define the function name and its parameters.
The second line uses the function parameters to return the required value.
Type,
Let us call the f of x with different arguments.
Type,
Now let us see how to write functions without arguments.
Now we will call the function as,greet open and close parentheses
Note that it is not mandatory for a function to return values.
The function greet neither takes any arguments nor returns any value.
Next we will learn how to comment in a code.
Documenting/commenting code is a good practice.
Docstrings are triple quoted comments entered just after the function definition.
Let us write a function which returns average of two numbers.
Type the code as shown. and press the Enter key two times.
Type, avg question mark
Now let us pass 3 and 5 as values to the arguments a and b to the function avg.
Type, avg inside brackets 3 comma 5 We get 4.0 as output.
Pause the video.Try this exercise and then resume the video.
Write a function circle which returns the area and perimeter of a circle with given radius r.
Type the code as shown. Press the Enter key two times.
The circle function requires us to return two values.
A python function can return any number of values in the form of a tuple.
Let us call the function circle as, a comma p is equal to circle inside brackets 6
Now Type, print inside brackets a comma p
We can see the output as area and perimeter of a circle of radius 6.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
Write docstrings to a function by putting it as a triple quoted string
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
2.Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
2. We can write a function to find the area of a rectangle as:def rectangle underscore area inside brackets l comma b colon

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Fluid Pressure and Flow.
In this tutorial we will demonstrate Fluid Pressure and Flow PhET simulation.
Here, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04
To follow this tutorial, Learner should be familiar with the topics in high school physics.
Using this simulation, We will demonstrate Change in pressure in the presence and absence of atmosphere.
Change in pressure in various fluid densities.
Bernoulli's principle.
Calculate the pressure at the bottom of the tank.
Observe the trajectory of a fluid
I have already downloaded the simulation to my  Downloads folder.
At the prompt type,  cd space Downloads and press  Enter.
Type  java space hyphen jar space fluid  hyphen  pressure  hyphen  and  hyphen  flow  underscore  en  dot  jar  and press  Enter.
Fluid Pressure and Flow simulation  opens.
Interface has three tabs.
On the left of the screen, we have three buttons.
On clicking each of the buttons a different underground tank opens.
let us click on the first button.
Screen opens with a faucet and a tank.
Click and drag the faucet slider to fill the tank with water.
Observe that an outlet is provided at the bottom of the tank to drain the fluid.
Drag the slider to drain the fluid.
Drag and place the  Pressure gauge in the tank to touch the fluid.
To expand the Fluid Density box, click on the green Plus sign.
Observe that the Fluid Density slider has three different fluids.
Drag the slider from gasoline to honey.
Observe the change in the Fluid Density as we drag.
In Fluid density box we can edit the values from 700 kg per meter cube to 1420 kg per meter cube.
Click on the red minus button to close the Fluid density box.
Click on the green plus button to expand the Gravity  box.
Observe that here a slider is provided to change Gravity from low to high.
The slider is at Earth.
As we drag the Gravity slider observe that pressure changes.
Gravity's value can be changed from 1.0  m/s
Click on Reset All button.
Drag the faucet slider to fill the tank upto the brim.
Note that once the tank is filled to the brim, faucet slider becomes inactive.
Select the Grid box to show the grid lines.
Drag and place the Pressure gauge on the 0 meter line.
Here, observe that atmospheric pressure is 101.325 kiloPascal.
Click on Atmosphere Off radio button.
Value of pressure is 0.00 KiloPascal.
Click the Atmosphere On radio button.
This indicates that, pressure is measured in the presence of an atmosphere.
Next we will measure pressure in different fluids.
We will make a tabular column for Fluid Density, Depth, and Pressure.
To take the measurement drag the Pressure gauge to 1 meter.
Note the value in the table.
Similarly drag pressure gauge to 2  meters and 3 metres and note the values.
I have noted the values in the table.
Drag the slider towards gasoline.
Observe the change in pressure as we change the density.
Drag the Pressure gauge to 1 meter to measure the pressure in gasoline.
As an Assignment, Note the change in the values of pressure for the given values of depth.
Click on Reset All button.
Now let's demonstrate the change in pressure as the tank's shape changes.
Click on the third tank button.
An underground basin opens.
The basin is divided into two compartments.
Observe that there are three weights on the left of the basin instead of a faucet.
One 500 kg and two 250 kg weights.
Under Units, click on Atmospheres radio button.
Observe the value on the pressure gauge.
It has changed from 101.300 kiloPascal to 0.9998 atmospheres.
Place the pressure gauge in the right compartment of the basin touching water.
Observe the value on the pressure gauge.
Select the Grid check box.
Place 250 kg weight in the left compartment of the basin.
Observe the change in the water level in the right compartment.
Continue to add 500 kg and 250 kg weights to the left compartment.
As we add the weights, notice the increase in water level in the right compartment.
This demonstrates the principle of hydraulic lift.
We will now explore Flow tab.
Select the Flow tab to open the screen.
In this screen we have a water tube and end pipes.
Each end pipe is provided with three handles.
Height of the pipe can be changed using the upper and lower handles.
We can click and drag the middle handle of the end pipe to move it up and down.
We can control the flow rate by dragging the Flow Rate slider.
Now select Flux meter check box.
A blue coloured ring along with a yellow box appears on the screen.
This box displays the value for Flow Rate, Area and Flux.
Using the Flux meter we can calculate the total flux entering a given area.
Drag the Flux meter through the pipe.
Observe that blue ring changes its size to adjust the size of the water pipe.
As we drag the ring, observe the value of flux that is passing through it.
The amount of flux passing through the ring depends on its area.
Uncheck the Flux meter  check-box.
Select Friction check-box.
Observe that the flow of dots slows down.
Using the Red Dots button we can insert black dots into the fluid.
Click on Reset All button.
Let us uncheck the Dots check-box and click the Red button.
Drag and place Speed meter in the water pipe.
Similarly drag the Pressure gauge and place inside the water pipe.
Drag the Pressure gauge and Speed meter all along the water pipe.
Observe that values of speed and pressure remain uniform.
This is because the flow of water is Streamlined.
Click and drag the handles on both the sides of the water pipe to change its shape.
Observe the change in the speed and pressure in the turbulent flow.
Let us increase the Flow Rate to maximum.
Drag the Speed meter towards extreme left.
And observe the speed to be 3.5 meter per second.
Recall that speed is a scalar quantity.
Blue vector represents direction of velocity.
Drag the pressure gauge and place it on the speed meter.
Observe that the pressure is 115.896 kiloPascal.
Drag another Speed meter from the tools and keep it in first wider region.
Notice the change in speed and velocity in the wider region.
The speed has decreased to 1.4 meter per second and the velocity vector has also decreased.
Drag and place Pressure gauge from the tool box in the first wider region.
Observe that pressure has increased to 121.528 kiloPascal.
Here we can say that as pressure increases, speed decreases.
As an assignment,Observe the change in speed and pressure when, fluid density is changed to gasoline and honey.
Click on Water Tower tab to open it.
In this screen we will calculate pressure at the bottom of the tank.
In this screen we can see a faucet and a water tower.
On the faucet there are two radio buttons.
Manual to start the flow of water and Match Leakage to stop the flow.
On the right side of the screen select the Measuring Tape check-box.
Adjust the measuring tape to measure the height of the Tank.
Note the value of the height.
Click on the Fill button to fill the tank completely.
Place the Pressure gauge on the inlet of the tank to measure the pressure.
Note the value of pressure at the surface.
Let us solve the given numerical.
A tank of cubical shape is filled with water to a height of 10.42 m.
Find the pressure exerted at the bottom of the tank.
The atmospheric pressure is 102.3 kPa.
Density of water is 1000 kg/m
Click and drag the Pressure gauge to the bottom of the tank.
Observe that the pressure at the bottom of the tank is 198.1 kiloPascal.
Calculate pressure at the bottom of the tank using the formula:P=P
Substitute the values from the numerical into the formula.
Notice that the value of pressure is converted to newton.
The required pressure at the bottom of the tank is 204.5 kPa.
Now we will compare the calculated value with the observed pressure.
Notice that pressure in the simulation is comparable to the calculated value.
Solve the given numericals.

Thank you for joining.
Welcome to this tutorial on Build Structures.
In this tutorial, we will learn to : create structures of small molecules, peptides
modify structure,  minimize energy and join models.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Chimera Interface . If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
To record this tutorial, I am using : Ubuntu OS version 14.04 ,Chimera version 1.10.2 ,Mozilla firefox browser 42.0 . and a working internet connection.
Here, I have opened a Chimera graphics window.
Let us now start building a chemical structure using Build Structure tool.
Click on Tools menu, scroll down to Structure editing option.
From the sub-menu, click on Build Structure.
A Build Structure dialog box opens on the screen.
Click Start Structure button, available at the top of the dialog box.
Here we have options to build the structure from the scratch.
We can also modify existing structure, adjust bonds, adjust torsions, join models etc.
Let's choose Start Structure option.
Here, there are many options to start a structure.
We can add atom, fragment, fetch a structure from Pubchem data base,
create peptide, DNA, RNA etc.
To build small molecules, click on atom radio button. Atom parameters section opens.
By default, the structure begins with a helium atom.
Click on Center of the view radio button to place the helium atom at the center of the panel.
We also have options to input the X , Y  and  Z coordinates.
Click on Select placed atom.
In the named text box, type the name of the session as  Sample1.
Click on Color new atoms by element.
A single Helium atom appears on the panel.
Now we can modify this atom to any other molecule using Modify Structure option.
Select Modify Structure option from the main drop-down menu.
Let us try to modify helium to a methane molecule.
Let the helium atom be in the selection mode.
In the Build Structure dialog box,
change the Element to Carbon, Bonds to 4 and Geometry to tetrahedral.
Hydrogen atoms are attached as needed to satisfy the valency.
By default, some of the parameters are already selected, leave them as such.
Observe the panel. Helium atom is now replaced by Methane molecule.
Using Select menu, clear the selection.
To further modify this molecule to Methyl amine, select any hydrogen atom.
Hold the CTRL key and click on any hydrogen atom on the methane structure.
Hydrogen atom is now selected.
In the Modify Structure dialog box, change the Element to nitrogen, Bonds to 3 , Geometry -trigonal.
Observe the panel. Amino group is now added to methane molecule.
Clear the selection using Select menu.
If you want to delete any atom or bond from the structure- select the atom or the bond, click on delete button in the Build Structure dialog box.
To revert back to the original structure, add hydrogens using Tools menu.
Using the center mouse button, drag and place this model at the corner of the panel.
In Build Structure dialog box, click the drop-down menu and select Start Structure option.
Now click on fragment radio button.
A Fragment library of various cyclic compounds is listed here.
Click on 5-membere rings.
Choose fragment from the list.
I will choose imidazole.
Imidazole molecule is displayed on the screen.
Move the imidazole molecule closer to methyl amine model.
Uncheck the box for model number zero, on the Active model status bar.
This will make the amine model inactive on screen.
Using center mouse button, move the imidazole closer to the amine model.
We can join the two models on the panel, using Join Models option in the Build structure dialog box.
Select one hydrogen atom from each model where you intend to form a bond.
Hold CTRL and Shift key at the same time, click on the hydrogen.
Now the hydrogens are selected.
Click on other bond option.
Information regarding the bonds is displayed on the dialog box.
Observe the panel, two models are joined.
Close the session using File menu.
Click on the lighting bolt icon at the bottom of the window to get back to graphics window.
Next, let us create a peptide chain.
In the Build Structure dialog box, select Start Structure.
Click on peptide radio button.
In the Peptide Sequence text box, type the single letter code for amino acids.
Let us type some random amino acid sequence.
Type: ACDEFGH. The residues are added from N to C terminus.
Type session name as Sample2.
Add Peptide Sequence dialog-box opens.
This dialog box is for specifying phi and psi angles.
By default, phi and psi angles of -57 and -47 are displayed.
These values correspond to a alpha-helix structure for the peptide fragment.
If you want to set the values, you can do so manually.
For now, we will leave the phi\psi values unchanged.
Observe the panel. We have a peptide chain displayed as helix.
To minimize energy of the structure, type: minimize on the command text box. Press Enter.
A Dock Prep dialog box appears, with model name.
By default, some parameters are selected.
For now, we will not make any changes. Click on OK button.
This opens another dialog box to add hydrogens to the structure.
A few parameters are already selected. Click on OK button.
Observe the panel. Hydrogens are added to the structure.
Another dialog box opens. Choose the force field package.
By default, AMBER ff14SB is selected for standard residues.
It will take a few seconds to minimize the structure.
Now, on the panel, we have a structure with most preferred conformation.
Close the session using File menu and open Graphics window.
Using the Build stucture tool, we can create a double helical DNA/RNA.
Click on the radio button helical DNA/RNA.
In the Sequence text box, type one letter nucleotide code for a DNA fragment.
For demonstration I will type, ATGCATGC.
Click on DNA, click on B-form.
Edit the name as Sample3.
A model of DNA as double helix displayed on the panel.
Change to atoms display using Presets menu.
Let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to: create structures of small molecules, peptides  and DNA fragments,
modify structure,
minimize energy and  join models.
For the Assignment-  Join two benzene molecules to build a biphenyl molecule.
Build a peptide fragment with your own choice of amino acid sequence.
Build a RNA fragment with a random nucleotide sequence.
This is Snehalatha from IIT Bombay, signing off.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on presentation using Latex and Beamer.
Let me first explain the arrangement that I have on the screen.
I have the source file here, I will do the compilation here using pdflatex command
and the resulting output will be seen here in this corner.
Alright, this is the first slide. Let's go to the second one. This is the outline. How is this created?
Begin frame, end frame define one slide. Frame title is "outline". It comes here.
Then I use the normal itemized command. Let’s go to the third slide.
These explain how to use latex, this explains how to install and run latex on Windows.
And we hope to give more permanent links for all of these from fosse dot in.
So, this is the source for this slide.
You can see that we have come to the end of this document.
Let’s go to the beginning. Let’s go to the top of this file. Now what I am going to do is, whatever change,
whatever improvement that I am going to make to this are here. I am going to add one at a time and then explain.
Here also.. alright. Then what we do is, you come here and use the package.
Let's add this – beamer theme shadow. Let me cut it, go here, paste it. All of these are pasted above the "document" command.
There are lots of these packages. I am going to illustrate some of the other features now.
We will give references for future reading as a part of this introduction, as we see here – ‘References for further reading’.
"Minimal animation" that you can use to present your talk, "Two column format, Figures and Tables, Equations, Verbatim" and so on.
Alright, let’s come back to the beginning. The next one is logo. Let’s cut and paste logo from here.
This also has to be pasted above the begin document command. This logo, let’s see what this looks like.
Let me just see it by open iitb logo.pdf. I am giving the same name over here.
On including this "logo" command, of height 1 cm. it is going to come in this corner.
So let’s see what it looks like. Let’s click this. You can see that iitb logo has come.
Next, we will add this command. For presentations, sometimes it is useful to make all the lettering bold.
So in view of that, I will include this, cut, paste.
Actually I will have to include this after the begin document command.
Let me save this. Let me compile it. Alright now, watch this. As I click this, all the letters will become bold.
You can see that it has become bold.
Then, now I am going to improve the writing here.
For example, it tries to fill lots of things here. Here, the title comes here, here the author information comes but lots of information is coming.
Sometimes I may want to have a smaller title here. For example, this space may not be large enough.
So what we will do is, that is solved using this.
For example, this is the running title.
Let me cut this. This should come after the command title, between the title command and the actual title.
So, let me paste it here. You can see that whatever I have pasted now is within square brackets.
So let’s save it. Run it.
So, as I do it, let’s click this. Look at this as I click what happens to this part.
You can see that the title has now changed. I have put only the bottom portion because that’s what I’m giving within the square bracket – "Presentation using LaTeX and Beamer".
Then I am saying that h-space is half a cm. I am giving a space here. And then I have the page number over here.
It says 1 by 3 here. Then 2 by 3 here. 3 by 3 here and so on.
That is achieved using ‘insert frame number divided by insert total frame number’.
Now, I will do the same thing for author. So, let's come here.
Let’s cut this. And after author, this comes.
Let me save it. Compile it. Click this.
You can see that Kannan Moudgalya has come. This is what I have given within the square brackets. Now this is going to come on every page.
Let’s go to the next topic. This is including equations.
The whole thing is in the form of a frame – a complete frame.
So, what I will do is, I will cut the whole thing.
Come back here, go to the bottom of this document. Save it.
So, I have created a new slide. Let’s see what this looks like.
So this is where the frame starts.
Let us compile this. Now you see that 4 pages are there. So, it still says three, so if I click this once more, so it becomes 4.
So this is the equation containing slide. I am not going to explain how to write these equations.
These are explained in the spoken-tutorial that I have created earlier on creating equations.
All that I have done is, I went to that latex document, cut and pasted it here, that’s all.
And.. of course I have removed the equation numbers. It does not make sense to give equation numbers in a slide.
On the other hand, it may be useful for you at times to highlight the color.
For example- if I want to change this into blue, I will do the following. Come here.
The command is – color, blue- and then I have to close this.
Save it. Compile it. And click this. You can see that this has become blue.
So, you may not want to refer to an equation by numbers but you can say that consider the equation in blue or you may want to say that look at the mass balance equation and so on.
You want to refer to it by something that people can remember in talks.
Next what we will do is, what I will do now is to include animation
which is useful to present information concept by concept.
So I have cut, let's paste it here. Let us see what this looks like.
Let's first compile it and see what happens.
This is from the spoken tutorial on letter writing. This information is also there.
The only difference that I have done now is that between begin enumerate and end enumerate, I have put this ‘item plus minus alert’.
Let’s see what this does. See, here I have put a command called ‘pause’, so the moment I put a command pause, it stops there, now the begin enumerate starts.
So, let me just go forward. Page-down. Next page, next page, next page.
As I go down, you see that the latest information is in red, all others are in the default color namely black. I have come to the end of the document.
So, this is one easy way to create animation where you want to present information a little at a time.
Next what I want to do is- change the alerted color to blue. For example, here the alerted color is red, this is known as alerted color.
I want to make this alerted color blue. So that this is consistent with this color that I have chosen.
Okay, let me come here, cut this.
This should go to the beginning of this document before the begin document command.
Let me compile it, when I click this you can see now that the alerted color has now become blue.
It is achieved through the command ‘set beamer color – alerted text’ there is a space here ‘foreground equals blue’, fg equals blue.
Now what I am going to do is- to show,  how easy it is to change the color of the entire document.
So, what I will do is.. will come here, after this slash document class, before the beamer frame starts. I will write here "brown".
Save it. Compile it.
You can see that it has become brown. So without too much work.
So what I will do is, I will take this back to the original color.
The default color is blue, so I don’t have to type it. Now we are back in blue.
So let’s come here, I will delete this. I will now include figures.
Cut this. Come here. Go to the end of this.
The last one. Let’s compile it. Let’s go to the next page. So, example of the figure is given here.
Alright, what are the guidelines in placing this? There are some important guidelines. We will see it with the next bit.
Let’s cut this. Paste this. Compile it.
So, I have got this. "Hints for including figures".
Let’s come to the source where we created the figure. This is how we created this figure. So, what are the guidelines?
"Do not use floated environments in presentations". for example, don’t say 'begin figure, end figure' which you need in the latex documents.
By the way, if you want to know about how to include a figure and more about it you have to go to the spoken tutorial on Tables and Figures.
So, do not use this. Use ‘include graphics’ directly.
So, for example, include graphics command is used and I’m saying that use the complete width of the text and the file is 'iitb'.
By the way, Beamer already comes with necessary packages. So, you don’t have to include any package. Use any package, it is already included.
And then we put the whole thing in the center environment. And this frame is over.
Do not include caption, figure number etc.
Once again people are not going to remember these numbers.
If you want to refer to a previously shown figure, show it again.
It does not cost any money to create another slide. Make a copy of the earlier shown slide and do it again.
Alright, that completes the figure and the guidelines. And we have come to the end of this document.
Let us now see how to include a two column environment.
Let’s come here. Let’s go to the end of the document. Save it.
What I will do is to make it easier, I will first remove this so that it becomes easy.
So, what I’m going to do is- I’m going to give, show part of the information. Let’s compile this and see what happens.
So I have this, two columns.
This is not saved, that is why. See the star star. What I will do is, let me first save it.
So, this is the problem if you try to compile it without saving. The pdf file that you see here, does not correspond to what you have here.
So, let’s compile this. Let’s come here. Now what you see here corresponds to what you have here.
Let me just center it. So, frame title 'Two Columns' and I’m using the command ‘mini page’ and I’m centering it and I’m using 45 percent of the text width.
begin enumerate. These two and then end enumerate. And as before I am alerting.
See these two. This is the end of the document. Now what I will do is, I will come and attach whatever I had at the end of this.
Here, the previous 'mini page' got over. Now I am going to create another mini page. In this 'mini-page', I am going to put this iitb, the same image that we saw earlier.
And this mini-page also is 45 percent size. Let’s compile this, let’s first save this.
Now let me click this. Now you see it has come. But it has a small problem in that. When I go to this page, it shows the first item and also this figure.
Although the figure comes later on, it shows this because no where have we told latex to show this later. It is perhaps implicit.
So for example, if you say that, if you put this information within this item then we say that show this first and then show this.
But no where are we saying that this should come later.
So one has to be careful of such evinces. One way to solve this problem is to put a ‘pause’.
Let me compile this. Save this. So now this is okay.
This problem is solved. The first one, the second one, and then one more, it pauses once. And, you can see that it has been solved.
Alright, let’s come here. The next one is the table.
Save this. Let’s compile this. You can see that the table has come.
I am not going to explain how to create this table, this has already been explained in the spoken tutorial on tables.
All that I have done is to cut and to paste it here. Let’s go to the beginning of the frame.
It’s the same table that we used earlier, I just cut and pasted it. You can see the begin tabular and end tabular commands coming within center environment.
OK..What are the guidelines? The guidelines are similar to figures.
So, let’s see that also. See the guidelines are here.
Let me compile. See this, move forward.
Once again, do not use floated environments in presentations.
In the spoken tutorial on tables, we put the tabular inside the table environment.
Table environment is a floated one, do not include it here. Insert it directly.
For example, we put it directly inside the center environment.
Do not include caption, table number etc. make a copy of it, if required.
Now, here I want to point out the way animation happens. For example, in this slide, it does not alert with a different color.
Recall that we used the blue color for alerting. Why does it happen?
That is because we have used a different kind of environment here.
begin itemize, end itemize, within that we used item plus minus. Previously we were using the word 'alert'.
Recall that. We are not using that anymore. As a result, it just comes in black. This is simpler way to include animation.
You can pick and choose. So, this is what I have written here. "Show different animations in the previous slide".
Now, there is a need to convert this into a handout. For example- if you try to print this,
whatever we have here, it will produce 24 pages even though there are only 10 pages.
There are only 10 unique frames but there are 24 pages. But if you try to print out, it will produce 24 pages.
One way to do that, to take care of this is to use a simple switch here called 'handout'.
If I do this, let me compile it; now there are only 10 pages. Let’s compile this once more.
Now the animation is no longer there. If I go to the next page, next page, next page, next page, next page and so on.
Of course, what if I want to change the color? Then you put 'brown' once again.
You can see that it has changed. So, all the parameters here are to be included separated by commas.
So, let me just put this back to blue. Compile it.
Now what we will do is, sometimes you have to include Verbatim environment.
So, let me just take this example.
Let’s go here, go to the end. Save it. So this is where the verbatim begins.
So you can see that the verbatim is created.
Here, I have illustrated it with some SciLab commands. I have changed the color here to blue, here to blue and so on.
The only unique thing that you have to do is to say begin frame within square bracket – fragile.
If you don’t do that, there will be a problem. Okay.. so you see this, we will come back and check that.
So suppose I delete this. Save it. Compile it.
It will come and say that something is not okay.
So, let's put this back – fragile. Save it, exit from here.
Compile it once again. It has come now.
Beamer class has lots of information. How does one know about other things.
So, I have some information here, let’s go to the bottom.
So essentially that information, where to get this extra information is in this slide.
We will compile it and we will go through that. The authoritative source for beamer is this file, 'beamer user guide dot pdf'.
I located it at this point but it is also available through this beamer project website by the author of beamer class.
I’ll just illustrate this; I’ve already downloaded this. It’s in that site that I have mentioned earlier.
For example, it’s a 224 page document. It’s a huge document.
What I want to show here is that you can use the information from here directly.
So let’s come here. In the very first page, the author talks about how to create simple slides and he has given the source also.
We will cut this, copy, let me minimize this. Let me go to the end of the document.
We paste it. Save it. Compile it. So let’s go to the next page.
You can see that whatever we saw there has come here. Here the author has used what is known as the theorem environment.
So, for example- begin theorem, end theorem, it comes here. He has also used the frame subtitle that comes here in small letters.
And then begin proof, end proof come here. He says 'proof', it opens another window, calls it ‘proof dot’.
This is how it is defined, how this environment is defined. He uses a different alert mechanism.
So if you want to see this, you just go back; remove this handout so that we can see the animation. Compile it.
So let’s go to page number 34.
Let’s see the animation now by going backwards. You see this, you see this.
So what he does here is, so these two items are numbered one, and the others are numbered two and three.
In other words, it is possible to arbitrarily specify the sequence in which the things that you have on the slide will appear.
We don’t have time to go through this in more detail. I would suggest that you go through the reference given here to know more about it.
This guide has lots of features, this beamer class has very large number of classes, and you may want to try out some of them.
Okay. Let me change this back to handout.
The problem with the presentation mode, we are now going to the handout mode,
the presentation mode where you show the animations, generally takes a lot of time to compile.
So, typically you would want to work with the handout mode as much as possible and only once in a while when you really want to check it out you want to use the presentation mode.
Finally of course, when you make the presentation, you may want to use the presentation mode.
And if you want to take a printout, use the handout mode. Let’s go to the end. We are almost at the end of the spoken tutorial.
Let’s acknowledge. In fact let me just copy the whole thing, come here.
Let me just compile it here as usual. Okay.
The funding for this spoken tutorial has come from the National Mission on Education through ICT. This is the website of this mission.
I want to thank you for joining us. This is Kannan Moudgalya, signing off. We would like to receive your feedback at kannan@iitb.ac.in. Thank you very much.

The Spoken Tutorial Project team: conducts workshops using spoken tutorials and
This tutorial is contributed by Snehalatha Kaliappan and Madhuri Ganapathi from IIT-Bombay.
Welcome to this tutorial on Projectile motion.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate Projectile Motion PhET simulation.
Using this simulation, we will-
2. Estimate where an object will land, given its initial conditions.
3. Determine how horizontal and vertical motion of a projectile are independent.
4. Investigate the variables that affect the drag force.
5. Examine the effect of drag force on the velocity and acceleration.
Let us define a projectile.
A projectile is any object that is fired, pitched or thrown.
The path of the projectile is called its trajectory.
Projectile motion is a form of motion in which a projectile is thrown near the Earth's surface.
A projectile moves along a curved path under the action of gravity.
Gravity is the downward force acting on a projectile.
Gravity influences its vertical motion and causes the parabolic trajectory.
Some examples of projectile motion are-  A baseball that has been thrown.
A bullet that is fired from a gun or rifle.
I have already downloaded Projectile Motion PhET simulation to my Downloads folder.
To open the simulation, right click on projectile-motion_en.html file.
Select the option Open With Firefox Web Browser.
This is the interface of Projectile Motion PhET simulation.
The interface has four screens:
Vectors,
Drag ,
Lab.
Click on Intro screen.
Using this screen, let's study the factors affecting a projectile’s trajectory.
Intro screen has a  cannon mounted on a  pedestal.
Default height of the pedestal is 10 m.
Height label disappears when height is adjusted.
We can change the height of the pedestal between 0 to 15 m.
By default, cannon's angle is at 0 degrees.
Cannon's angle can be changed from minus 90 degrees to 90 degrees(-90 to 90).
Drag Cannon's angle to zero degrees.
At the bottom of the screen, we have: a slider to change Initial Speed,
yellow Eraser icon to erase the trajectory,
red Launch Projectile icon to launch the projectile,
Play/Pause and Step buttons,
Normal and  Slow radio-buttons to change animation speed.
At the top left corner, we have  Zoom in and Zoom out  buttons to zoom the view.
On the top right corner, we have a white box.  It contains a probe and a measuring tape.
Probe is used to measure Time, Range and Height of the trajectory.
A drop down list is provided to select the projectiles.
By default, Pumpkin is selected as a projectile.
Mass and Diameter of the selected projectile is displayed below the list.
Next we have a check box to introduce Air Resistance with Drag Coefficient.
Then we have Velocity Vectors and Acceleration Vectors  check boxes.
Let us select Human projectile from the list. Observe the displayed Mass and Diameter of the Human projectile.
Click on red Launch icon. Observe the trajectory.
Next we will change cannon's angle to 10 degrees.
Launch the projectile.
Observe projectile's trajectory as we change cannon's angle.
Highest point is shown in green colour.
Drag and place the probe on the highest point of the trajectory.
Note the Time, Range and Height at the highest point.
Let us make tabular column for Cannon's Angle, Time Range and  Height.
I will enter the values for 10 degrees angle.
Drag the probe back to its place.
Similarly, I will change the cannon's angle to 20 degrees.
Launch the projectile and observe the trajectory.
Place the probe on highest point of the trajectory.
Note the values of Time, Range and Height  in the table.
Launch the projectile and observe the trajectory.
Adjust the target on the base line so that projectile falls on the target.

In this screen, we will explore how velocity, acceleration and force are affected by air resistance.
Vectors screen has nearly same tools as in Intro screen.
In this screen, pedestal's height is 0 metres and cannon's angle is 80 degrees.
Change cannon's angle to 70 degrees and launch the projectile.
Here, we have only one projectile - Cannonball.
We can change the diameter and mass by dragging.
Uncheck Air Resistance check-box and launch the projectile.
Without air resistance, projectile moves to a greater altitude and longer distance .
Now click on the following check boxes- Velocity Vectors,
Acceleration Vectors,
Force Vectors.
Launch the projectile.
You will see the vector components on the trajectory.
Next we will move on to Drag screen.
Click on Drag screen at the bottom of the interface.

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Lists in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn:
To practise this tutorial, you should know to use any WYSIWYG or text editor and a web browser.
If not, then go through gedit Text Editor and Firefox tutorials on this website
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML 5
gedit Text Editor and Firefox web browser
However you may use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Please download and extract them.
In HTML, Lists help us to
Create structured navigations like menu bars
In HTML, there are three different types of Lists
Unordered List
Ordered List
Definition or Description List
All these types have a start and an end tag.
This is how the syntax of a List will look like.
Here li denotes list item.
Type of the list and the list item tags have a start and an end tag.
Unordered list will list the contents  in the form of bulleted points
Whereas Ordered List will list the contents in a numbered sequence
Can sequence the List in alphabets and roman numerals also
Let us open our file MyFirstPage.html, which we created earlier.
The same is available in the Code Files link.
Here we have three different types of links.
Pause the tutorial and modify your code as shown.
Here I have started and ended with ul.
Each list item is written between a separate li start and end tag.
Save the file.
Switch to the folder where the file is saved.
Right-click on the filename and open in the web browser.
Here in the output, we can see that all the three links are now listed in bullet points.
I don’t want this to be in a rounded bullet point.
Instead I want it in some other shape, say square.
We can do this with the help of CSS.
We can use CSS and style to modify how the unordered list should be displayed.
We have to specify the style inside the start tag.
This is the syntax
The Unordered list styles are:
Switch to the editor window and try this.
Inside the ul start tag, type as shown here
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Instead of the rounded bullet points, we see square bullet points.
Similarly, we can change the unordered list styles to show other shapes for the bullets.
Next we will learn how to create an ordered list.
Here, I will make a very small change.
Instead of ul, I will type ol in the start and end tags.
Also, I will remove the style attribute inside the start tag.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Now the links are listed in a numbered sequence.
There are several types in which you may display the ordered list using the type attribute.
They are:
Roman Numerals in Uppercase, Roman Numerals in Lowercase
Let us try these.
Inside the ol start tag, let me add the following-
Save the file.
Note that, now the links are in lower case letter sequence.
Next, we will learn the Definition or Description List.
Description List   is not like the other two lists.
It will display the list in the form of a name value pair.
That means it will display the line item without prefixing it with a bullet or a number
Each list item will have a name and a value to it.
dt refers to the Term or the name
dd refers to the Term definition or the value
Must have at least one term and a value assigned to it.
We can have multiple values for a single term.
The way to write Description List is shown here.
Let us try this.
After the ordered list type the following piece of code as shown here.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
We can also have a list inside a list. This is called a Nested List
Both the lists need not be the same
For eg: Both need not be ordered or unordered or descriptive
Here is an example of a Nested List.
Let us look at the code for this example
Pause the video and try this on your own.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Maintenance and Repair of the Biogas plant.
In this tutorial, we will learn different techniques to maintain and repair the biogas plant and  the biogas burner.
Periodic partial and complete cleaning of the biogas plant is a must.
This will ensure that the biogas plant runs smoothly.
It will also ensure efficient working of the biogas plant for many years.
Let us first look into the maintenance section.
So, how often should one carry out maintenance of the biogas plant?
Maintenance should be carried out on a daily basis by doing the following.
Always, mix the bio-waste with water in the proper ratio.
This will ensure smooth flow of the bio-waste from the mixing tank into the digester tank.
If adding plant waste, crush and chop the leaves up to 1-4 cms.
Do not feed too much straw into the digester tank as it is difficult to be digested.
Sticks and branches of trees should also be avoided.
Soap, oil, chemical, insecticide and pesticides should not be added.
Soil, sand or stone should also not be added
as they will accumulate at the base of the digester and hinder gas production.
Quantity of bio-waste to be supplied depends upon the size of the plant.
Too much bio-waste should not be fed into the digester.
This will lead to shorter retention time i.e. bio-waste will be in the digester tank for lesser time and fermentation won’t be completed.
Hence, manure will come out in the slurry tank without being digested.
If less bio-waste is fed into the digester then gas production will be low.
Water condensation should be checked regularly
as water in the pipeline will block the passage of gas.
Do so by lifting the gas pipe so that the water can run back into the digester tank.
Also, keep a check that the slurry is being pumped out smoothly into the slurry tank.
Ensure that the slurry is being emptied out of the slurry tank when it is full.
No inflammable items like lighter and/or cigarettes should be brought near the outlet pipe of the dome.
Another important thing to be done is that slurry in the digester tank should be completely removed once in three years.
This is usually done by the mason himself.
As shown, keep the mixing tank and the slurry tank covered.
This is done to ensure proper hygiene  and to avoid breeding of mosquitoes near the plant.
Let us now look into the repair section.
Repair of biogas burner should always be done by a qualified technician.
What you see here is a biogas burner with the flame.
To start repairing, first switch off the inflow of gas by turning off the knobs on  the hose pipe and at the burner.
Doing so is very important.
What you see here is the burner without the flame after the knobs have been turned off.
Wait for few minutes and light the burner to ensure that the gas inflow has stopped.
Now remove the hose pipe connected to the burner.
Do so by loosening the Vohj clip tightened on the hose pipe connected to the burner.
Once it is loosened, pull out the hose pipe.
Now place the hose pipe near your ear to check for the sound of gas.
No sound means no gas inflow and the repair work can be carried out safely.
Now we start dismantling the burner.
Next we will remove the debris in the burner.
As shown in the image, blow air through the hose-burner connector.
This will also help to check if air is reaching smoothly to the flame ring.
Slightly tap the burner and then turn it upside down.
You can see the debris fallen from the burner.
In case of hard debris which cannot be removed by blowing air, a dry scrubbing pad can be used.
To clean the flame ring, use a pin and insert it into the holes for cleaning.
A ring with clean holes will ensure smooth flow of gas and fuller flame.
A clean ring will look like this.
Apart from what is mentioned, periodic inspection of the plant is necessary.
Inspection will help to locate cracks on the surface of the digester tank.
Otherwise, the generated biogas can escape into the atmosphere through these cracks.
Hence, these cracks need to be sealed quickly.
Once in 3 years,  the mason also repaints the inner wall of the digester tank.
This is done by using white cement and synthetic resin adhesive mixture.
This mixture  will also help to seal the cracks, if present.
To make this mixture, use the following- 2 liters of water,
250 gms of Synthetic Resin Adhesive and  2 kgs of white cement.
Mix these thoroughly and use.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt about different techniques to maintain and repair of the biogas plant and the biogas burner.

Hi and welcome to a basic PHP tutorial.
I'll just go through how to use the "echo" function and how to set up your tags .
Those of you that are familiar with  "html" will know that there are html tags to start your page and to end your page.
They're not vital in an html page. As long as you've got an html extension, you're fine.
However, in PHP, you need the tags. This starts and this ends.
That's basically the standard notation for it.
However, our content goes in between here.
Now, I've already saved my file as "helloworld.php".
So, let's save that and have a look in here.
Okay, there's nothing in the page at the moment but we've got our page set up. It's absolutely fine.
The "echo" function works like this: we've got echo, we've got some double quotes and we've got a line terminator which is the semicolon mark.
And our text goes in between here.  Let's save that and we'll refresh.  And there we go.
Right, you can – and I find this very useful – write your "echo" function like this.
Because when you put an html code inside your echo function, these bits here don't represent line breaks. (and just to let you know, if you haven't learnt html yet I suggest you pick it up, at least the basics, because we're going to be using it quite a lot).
For that, you need to add your own html in. So for line break and then 'New line'.
We'll refresh this and there you go! Our 'html' has been incorporated.
Okay, just to let you know, this is one thing that a lot of people run into: 'image source equals' and your file goes there.
However, at the moment we've got 'echo'.
This shows that we're going to start our output and this, here, will show that we're ending our output.
We don't end it here; we're going to end it here.
So instead of these, we'll need inverted commas.
Basically, that will let us show our image here.
There's no file specified but you get the picture.
So, let me just show you what would happen if we keep these in and then with that I'll end the tutorial.
Right, we've got Parse error.
We either need a comma or a semicolon to end which proves that as we're coming up to here, we need a semicolon after this.
But in actual fact, that's not true.
So, just keep them as inverted commas.
Okay, that's the basics of the echo function and the PHP tags.  Hope you enjoyed learning them.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Working with Sheets.
Insert and Delete
Rename Sheets and
Move Sheets
Let us open our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
This file has been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Make a copy and then use it for practising.
Columns and rows can be inserted individually or in bulk.
First we will learn how to insert a new row or a new column in the spreadsheet.
In our Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file, let's click on the cell C1.
This cell has “Cost” written in it.
Now click on the Row icon in the Standard toolbar.
Many options related to rows are displayed in the context menu.
Notice 2 specific options Insert Rows Above and Insert Rows Below.
I will click on the option Insert Rows Above.
A new row gets inserted just above the cell C1.
Now click on the Column icon in the Standard toolbar.
Many options related to columns are displayed in the context menu.
Notice 2 specific options Insert Columns before and Insert Columns after.
I will click on the option Insert Columns Before.
A new column gets inserted to the left of the cell C1.
Let’s undo these changes.
Rows and columns can be inserted by clicking on Sheet menu in the menu bar, as well.
Another quick way to insert a new row or column is by right-clicking on any cell.
Right-click on cell C1 and click on Insert option.
The Insert Cells dialog box opens.
Here choose as per your requirement and click on the Ok button.
Explore these options on your own for your understanding.
I will skip this and click the Cancel button to close the dialog box.
Next, we’ll learn to insert multiple rows and columns at the same time.
Let’s say we want to insert 4 columns before SN which is cell A1.
So select the cells A1 to D1 by clicking and dragging the left mouse button.
Right-click anywhere on the selection and select Insert.
In the Insert Cells dialog box, click on the option Entire Column.
Then click on the OK button at the bottom.
Notice that 4 new columns get added before Serial Number.
Now click any random cell to deselect.
In a similar manner, we can add multiple rows as well.
Select any one column by clicking on the alphabet of the column above, as shown.
Now click on the Column icon in the Standard toolbar and then on Delete Columns option.
Suppose we want to delete more than one column at a time.
In my case, I want to delete these 3 columns which we inserted just now.
So, select the 3 columns by clicking on the alphabet of the column above, as shown.
All the 3 columns get selected.
Now click on the Column icon in the Standard toolbar and then on Delete Columns option.
The selected columns get deleted.
In a similar manner, we can delete multiple rows as well.
We will now learn about how to insert and delete sheets in Calc.
There are several ways to insert a new sheet in Calc.
We will learn about each one of them one-by-one.
At the bottom left, we see a tab named Sheet 1.
There are some icons located before that.
When we click on the Plus icon, a new sheet named Sheet2 gets added.
This new sheet gets added to the right of the current one.
We can also add sheets by clicking on the empty area next to the Sheet tabs.
By doing so, the Insert Sheet dialog box opens up.
Using this dialog box, we can add a sheet before or after the current sheet.
We can also add any no. of sheets at a time.
Under Position, I will select Before the current sheet.
And then click on the OK button at the bottom.
Notice that Sheet 3 and Sheet 4 get added before Sheet 2.
Another way to insert sheets is to click on the Sheet menu in the menu bar.
On doing so, the Insert Sheet dialog box opens up.
I will skip this and click on the Cancel button at the bottom.
Next let us learn how to delete sheets.
To delete a single sheet, right-click on the tab of the sheet you wish to delete.
And then, select the Delete Sheet option.
A confirmation dialog box pops up.
The selected sheet gets deleted.
How can we delete multiple sheets at a time?
For example, say we want to delete Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.
First click on the Sheet 2 tab.
Then holding the Shift key on the keyboard, click on Sheet 3 tab.
Now right-click on any one of the tabs and click on the Delete Sheet option.
A confirmation dialog box pops up.
Click on the Yes button to delete the sheet.
Let us undo these changes by pressing Ctrl + Z keys.
Sheets are named by default as Sheet 1, Sheet 2, Sheet 3 and likewise.
Calc has a provision to rename the sheets based on our needs.
For example, let’s rename Sheet 2 as “Dump”.
Do this by simply double-clicking on Sheet 2 tab.
Rename Sheet dialog box opens up.
There is a textbox with Sheet 2 written in it.
Delete this and type “Dump” as the new name.
Click on the OK button.
Sheet 2 tab has now been renamed to “Dump”.
Let us undo these changes by pressing Ctrl + Z keys.
We can manually rearrange the sheets by clicking on a sheet
Save the file by pressing Ctrl+S keys on the keyboard.
Now close the file by clicking the X icon on the top right corner.
In this tutorial, we learnt to :
Insert and Delete
Renaming Sheets and  Move Sheets

g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Let us start with an introduction to friend function.
We know, the private data is not accessible outside the class.
To access the private data, we use friend function.
A friend function is not a member function of the class.
Friend function can be invoked without using an object.
The argument passed in the friend function is used as its object.
Let us see the declaration of a friend function.
friend keyword is used to declare a friend function.
Then we give the return_type.
function_name is the name of the function.
Then we pass arguments as class_name and object of the class.
Let us look at an example.
In this program, we will perform addition operation.
Note that our file-name is frnd.cpp.
Here we are using std namespace.
Then we have declared a class frnd.
In this, we have declared variables 'a' and 'b' as private.
Here we have declared a function input() as public.
In this, we take input from the user.
This is our friend function as compute().
Here, we have passed arguments as class_name frnd and object of the class 'f1' .
Now, we can access the private members of class frnd using the friend function.
Here, we have used the compute() function.
In this, we will perform addition operation.
We add the variables  'a' and 'b'.
And then return the value.
Here, we access the private variables in non-member function using the object f1.
In this, we create an object of class frnd as f.
Then we call the function input() using the object f.
And here, we call function compute() and pass f as argument.
You can see that we have passed the argument as f in function compute().
This is done by using the method pass by value.
f is passed to the value of f1.
Now type:
g++ space frnd dot cpp space hyphen o space frnd. Press Enter.
Type: dot slash frnd
Here, it is displayed as:  Enter the value of a and b.
I will enter as: 8 and 4.
The result is: 12.
Let us move back to our slides.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learned  Friend function. e.g. friend int compute class-name frnd and object 'f1' .
As an assignment,  write a program to find out the square and cube of a number.
It summarizes the Spoken-Tutorial project.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installation of MarcEditor on Windows.
In this tutorial, we will learn to install  MarcEditor  on a 64-bit Windows machine.
To record this tutorial, I’m using:
This tutorial is most suitable for library staff.
Before moving ahead, please ensure that you have the following on your machine-
any web browser. For eg: Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome.
In your existing library, you may have the library records in an Excel spreadsheet.
And, your library is now being migrated to Koha Library Management System.
So, all the records will need to be converted from Excel into MARC format.
It is important to know that:
This is because Koha does not have the provision to directly import data which is in Excel format.
Let us begin.
To convert Excel data into MARC file i.e. (dot) mrc format, we will be using MarcEdit software.
To install this software, go to the browser and type this URL.
A new page with the heading Downloads opens.
Under Current Development, go to MarcEdit 7.0.x/MacOS 3.0.x
However, if you have a 32-bit machine, then you should click on the link Windows 32-bit download.
To check whether your machine is 32-bit or 64-bit, go to the bottom left corner of the machine.
Click on the Start icon.
Scroll up and click on Settings.
From these icons, click on System- Display, notifications, apps, power.
This opens another window with few options on the left side.
Locate the tab About and click on it.
On the same page, towards the right side, under the section PC, locate System type.
The details of your machine’s operating system will be displayed.
For my machine, it says 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor.
After reading the details, close the window.
To do so, go to the top right corner and click on the cross mark.
We will again come back to the same page, Downloads.
As my machine is 64-bit, I will click on 64-bit download.
Another new window with the heading 64-bit download opens with two sections-
Next, I will click on Download MarcEdit 7 link at the bottom of the Administrator section.
This is because I am the designated Koha administrator of my library.
A dialog-box MarcEdit_Setup64Admin.msi appears.
We can see 2 options here-
Click on the Save File button at the bottom.
After doing so, go to the Downloads folder of your machine.
Here, you can see that the file MarcEdit_Setup64Admin.msi has been saved.
Now, right-click on the saved file and from the options that appear, click on Install.
In the User Account Control dialog box, click on Yes.
Another window with the name Welcome to the MarcEdit 7 Setup Wizard appears.
Click on the Next button at the bottom of the page.
Another new window with the title License Agreement opens.
Read the License Agreement carefully.
And from the 2 options, I do not agree and I agree, click on the I Agree radio button.
Then, click on the Next button at the bottom of the window.
A new window named Select Installation Folder opens.
It shows the path of the folder where the installed software will be saved.
Alternately, you may install this software in a different folder of your choice.
You can also click on the tab Browse and select the desired path.
However, I will keep the folder path as it is, in the field Folder.
Now click on the Next button at the bottom of the window.
Another new window   Confirm Installation opens.
Now click on the Next button at the bottom of the same window.
Installing MarcEdit 7 window opens.
After this, we see a success message window.
Click on the Close button to exit this window.
A window with the title MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese opens.
Now minimize all the windows that are open.
You will see that a shortcut is created on the Desktop.
With this, we have successfully installed MarcEditor on the Desktop of a 64-bit Windows machine.
This is Bella Tony from IIT Bombay, signing off. Thank you for joining.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Examples through OMEdit.
In this tutorial, we will learn to open and simulate different Modelica library classes.
To record this tutorial, I am using : OpenModelica version 1.9.5 and  Ubuntu Linux OS 14.04.
But, the process demonstrated in this tutorial is identical in other OS such as- Windows,  Mac OS X or   FOSSEE OS on ARM.
To practice this tutorial, you should have OMEdit installed on your system.
You should also know how to work on the OMEdit window.
If not, please go through the previous OpenModelica tutorial on this website.
Let us switch to the OMEdit window.
On the left side of OMEdit window, we see the Libraries Browser. Here we can see a list of libraries.
Let us expand the Modelica library. To do this, click on the arrow head to the left of the Modelica library.
Now I will demonstrate an example from the Electrical library.
Expand the Electrical library.
Click on the arrow head to the left of Electrical library.
Under Electrical, we find Analog library.
Let's expand the Analog library.
Once again, we see many different libraries displayed.
Now, let’s expand the Example library.
Here we can see different examples of Analog.
Next, we will open the class named Rectifier.
Right-click on Rectifier and select Open Class.
We can also double-click on the class name to open the class.
Now we are in the Modeling Perspective window.
By default, the class opens in Diagram View.
I have already demonstrated how to switch between different views earlier in this series.
Now let's switch to the Text View by clicking on the Text View icon.
Here we can see the Modelica code pertaining to the Rectifier class.
Before simulating a model, we need to check for the correctness of the model.
To do this, first locate Check All Models button on the toolbar.
This button has white coloured double ticks on it. Click on it.
Immediately, the Messages Browser opens at the bottom of the window.
This will show messages pertaining to the Modelica class.
Now, let’s try to simulate the model.
On the toolbar, click on the green coloured arrow button.
This is the Simulate button which is used to simulate the model.
We can also press Ctrl and B keys to simulate the model.
On simulating, a new window opens.
It shows the compilation process of the class.
Once the compilation is successful, the output window displays the message: Simulation process finished successfully. Close this window.
By default, the Plotting Perspective should now open in the OMEdit window.
If it does not open, click the Plotting button at the bottom right.
We can also press Ctrl and F3 keys to open the Plotting Perspective.
Here we can see the simulation results of the Modelica class.
At the right of the Plotting Perspective, look at the Variables Browser window.
Under Variables Browser, we will learn to change input variable values of a Modelica class.
By default, IDC = 500, Losses = 2890.26
Change the value of IDC and see how the values of Losses change.
Let us change the value of IDC from 500 to 250
Go to the top right corner of the window.
Click Re-simulate button.
The success message window will open.
Once the simulation is completed, note the changes.Losses = 1756.77
Now let me demonstrate how to generate a plot.
We will generate a plot between Losses and Time.
Click on the check box against the Losses variable.
We can see a plot between Time on the X-axis and Losses on the Y-axis.
This plot describes the power losses for the diode bridge varying with time.
By default, the simulation runs from 0 to 0.1 unit time.
We can vary this interval using the Simulation Setup option.
To do this, go to the Modeling Perspective.
Click on the Modeling button.
Click on the Simulation Setup option on the toolbar.
The Simulation Setup window opens.
Here, change the Start Time to 0.01 unit.
Ensure that Simulate check box is checked.
And then click on Ok.
Immediately we see the success message window.
The class is re-simulated with a simulation interval of 0.01 to 0.1 unit time.
Let's delete these results.
To do so, right-click on Rectifier and then click on Delete Result.
The result has now been deleted.
Now I will demonstrate an example from Mechanics library.
First we will expand the Mechanics library.
Under Mechanics, we find Multibody library.
Let's expand the Multibody library also.
After this, let's expand the Example library.
Here we  can see different examples of Multibody Mechanics.
Next, we will expand the Elementary library.
Let us open the class named DoublePendulum.
To do this, right-click on DoublePendulum and select Open Class.
The class opens in Text view.
Now, click on Check All Models button on the toolbar.
Observe the Messages Browser.
This will show messages pertaining to the Modelica class.
Now, let’s try to simulate the model.
To do so, click on the Simulate button on the toolbar.
Once the compilation is successful, the Plotting Perspective opens in the OMEdit window.
Under the Variables Browser, let’s expand the damper variable.
By default,  d =  0.1, relative angular acceleration(a_rel) = 11.567 and  relative rotational angle [der(phi_rel)] = 4.1
Let us change the value of d from 0.1 to 0.05.and press Enter.
Then click Re-simulate button.
After completion of the simulation, observe the changes.
relative angular acceleration (a_rel) = 15.449 and  relative rotational angle [der(phi_rel)] = 4.359
Now, we will generate a plot between relative angular acceleration and Time.
Click on the check box against a_rel variable.
We see a plot between Time on the X-axis and a_rel on the Y-axis.
This plot describes the relative angular acceleration varying with Time.
By default, the simulation runs from 0 to 3 unit time.
Let's change this interval.
To do this, go to the Modeling Perspective.
Click on Simulation Setup option on the toolbar.
The Simulation Setup window opens.
Here, change the Start Time to 1 unit and the Stop Time to 5 units.
Ensure that Simulate check box is checked.
Then click on Ok.
We get the success message window.
The class is re-simulated with a simulation interval of 1 to 5 unit time.
Once the necessary plot is generated, we can delete the results.
In the Variables Browser, right click on DoublePendulum.
Select Delete Result. The result has now been deleted.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to open and simulate different Modelica library classes.
As an assignment:  Expand Magnetic library in Modelica.
Simulate SaturatedInductor class in FluxTubes library.
Change the values of a few input variables and re-simulate.
Generate a Parametric plot between i and LossPower of variable r.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Buffer Solutions.
In this tutorial we will learn, to prepare 0.5 M Acetate buffer of pH 3.6 and
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with, ChemCollective Vlabs interface.
If not, for relevant tutorials please visit our website.
Here I am using
Java version  8.0.
Here I have opened Virtual Chemistry Labs application window.
Click on File menu, and select Load homework option.
Double-click on Acids and Bases folder.
The required chemicals for this experiment are provided in the Stockroom Explorer.
A buffer solution, is composed of a weak acid or weak base and its conjugate salt.
Its pH changes very little when a small amount of acid or base is added to it.
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is useful for estimating the pH of a buffer solution.
Please refer to the excellent tutorial on buffers at the following link.
To prepare Acetate buffer of a particular pH, Acetic acid and Sodium acetate are mixed in various proportions.
To prepare 50 ml of pH 3.6 Acetate buffer-
Back to the Workbench.
From the Stockroom Explorer click on water,  1M Sodium acetate and 1M Acetic acid.
From Glassware cabinet retrieve, 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, 50 ml graduated cylinder.
Make the duplicates of all the apparatus.
Rename Erlenmeyer flasks as A1 and A2.
Let us prepare 0.5 M Acetic acid by diluting 1 M Acetic acid.
Measure 50 ml of Acetic acid in the graduated cylinder G1.
Pour the contents of the graduated cylinder G1  into Erlenmeyer flask A1.
Measure 50 ml of water using the same graduated cylinder.
Pour water into Erlenmeyer flask A1.
Click on flask A1 and note the pH.
Similarly prepare 0.5 M Sodium acetate solution.
Measure 50 ml of 1M Sodium acetate solution in graduated cylinder G2.
Transfer this solution into Erlenmeyer flask A2.
Measure 50 ml of water using the same graduated cylinder.
Pour water from graduated cylinder into Erlenmeyer flask A2.
Click on flask A2, note the pH.
We now have 0.5 M of  Acetic acid and 0.5 M Sodium acetate solutions.
Retrieve a 250 ml beaker from the glassware cabinet.
Transfer  46.3 ml of  0.5 M Acetic acid into the beaker.
Bring flask A1 over to the beaker.
Type 46.3 in the Transfer amount input bar.
Transfer  3.7ml of 0.5 M Sodium Acetate into the beaker.
Bring flask A2 over to the beaker.
Type  3.7 in the Transfer amount input bar.
Click on the beaker, check the pH in the PH Meter.
We now have an acetate buffer solution of pH 3.66.
Rename the beaker with buffer solution as Acetate buffer.
Remove the used Erlenmeyer flasks and Graduates cylinders from the Workbench.
To test the buffering action,
We will have to dilute, 1M hydrochloric acid(HCl) and 1M sodium hydroxide(NaOH) to 0.1 M hydrochloric acid(HCl) and  0.1 M sodium hydroxide(NaOH).
Retrieve two sets of-
Disposable pipettes from the glassware cabinet.
Rename  graduated cylinders as G1 and G2.
Rename Beakers as A and B
Rename Disposable pipette as P1 and P2.
Measure 9 ml of water using graduated cylinder G1
Add 1 ml of 1M HCl  to Beaker A using disposable pipette P1.
0.1 M of hydrochloric acid(HCl) is ready for use.
Similarly dilute 1M sodium hydroxide(NaOH)  with water to prepare 0.1M sodium hydroxide(NaOH).
Prepare 0.1 M sodium hydroxide(NaOH) in beaker B, similarly as before.
Diluted acid has a pH of 1.
Let us add a small amount of acid to check the buffering action.
Place the disposable pipette over the flask A.
Withdraw 0.2 mL of HCl  from flask  A.
Place the pipette over the beaker containing Acetate buffer.
Pour 0.2 ml into buffer solution.
Observe the change in pH. Notice that there is not much change in pH.
Now add small amount of base to the buffer solution.
Withdraw 0.2 ml of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide(NaOH) using disposable pipette.
Place the pipette over the beaker containing buffer.
Observe the pH Meter. Notice that there is no much change in the pH.
Add acid and base to the buffer solution a few more times and check the pH.
Tested buffering action with small amounts of hydrochloric acid(HCl)  and sodium hydroxide(NaOH).
As an assignment, Prepare pH 5.0 Acetate buffer and test with small amounts of acid and base.
Hint: use 14.7 ml of 0.5 M Acetic acid and 35.3 ml of 0.5 M Sodium acetate.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Conditional statements.
In this tutorial, we will learn to use
if/elif/else blocks
Python 3.4.3
To practice this tutorial, you should know how to use
strings and Input/Output statements
First let us learn about if condition.
if condition is used to decide whether to execute the statements inside the if block or not.
Next we will see about if else condition.
When the test condition is true, it will execute the body of if.
If the condition is False, body of the else is executed.
Note that, if and else statements end with a colon.
This denotes the beginning of the code block of True or False condition.
All the statements inside a code block are indented by 4 spaces.
Now let us check if an entered number is even or not.
Type, num is equal to int inside brackets input open and close brackets
Enter 4 and press Enter
Type, if num percentage 2 equal to equal to 0 colon
print inside brackets inside single quotes Even
Press backspace four times and type, else colon
print inside brackets inside single quotes Odd
Note that, the statements inside a code block are indented by 4 spaces automatically.
Next we will see another conditional statement called elif.
All the syntax and rules for elif are same as if/else statements.
In if/else, only one condition is checked.
But in elif statement multiple conditions can be checked.
All the subsequent conditions in elif ladder are not checked.
The else block gets executed if all the conditions in if and elif ladder are evaluated to False.
Let us understand if/elif/else ladder with an example.
Type, a is equal to minus 3
"negative" if it is negative or  "zero" if the above conditions are evaluated to False
Press Enter twice to see the output.
We can also have any number of elif conditions within an if/elif/else statements.
For example, based on the type of user the corresponding operations are performed using elif.
Given a number, num as input.
The solution is on your screen.
Next let us learn about ternary operator.
Ternary operator allows to test a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else.
Let us write a ternary conditional statement to find the largest of two numbers.
Type, a is equal to 4
b is equal to 2
large underscore num is equal to a if a greater than b else b
print inside brackets large underscore num
We got the required output.
Given a number, n as input.
The solution is on your screen.
Next we will learn about pass statement.
The pass statement acts as a null operation (i.e) nothing happens when it executes.
It works as a placeholder for a block of code.
It is used in a code block where actual code implementation is not known yet.
Let us understand the pass statement with an example.
Type a is equal to 11
Then type as shown.
If a divided by 2 equals to zero, if block is executed.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
So no operation is performed and nothing is displayed as output.
In this tutorial, we have learnt the conditional statements such as,
if/elif/else statement
Ternary conditional statement and  Pass statement
First. Given a variable t.
Print Good Morning if it is less than 12, otherwise print Hello. Use if else statement.
Second. Convert the below if else code into ternary conditional statement.
Second. Use the following statement to convert the if else code into a ternary statement

Welcome to the series of Blender tutorials.
This script has been contributed by Sneha Deorukhkar and Bhanu Prakash and edited by Monisha Banerjee.
what is the Material panel in the Properties window;
what are the various settings in the Material panel of the Properties window.
The 'Properties window' is located on the  right hand side  of our screen.
We have already seen the first panels of the 'Properties window' and their settings in the previous tutorial.
Let's see the next panel in the 'Properties window'.
First, we must resize our 'Properties window' for better viewing and understanding.
Left click the  left edge of the 'Properties window', hold and drag to the left.
To learn how to resize the Blender windows, see our tutorial - How to Change Window Types in Blender.
Go to the top row of the 'Properties window'.
Left click the Sphere icon at the top row of the 'Properties window'.
This is the Material panel. Here we can add a material to the active object.
By default, a standard material is added to the cube.
This material is part of the Material slot highlighted in blue.
Left click the plus sign at the top right corner of the Material Panel to add a new Material slot.
Left click New to add a new material. By default, all new materials are added with basic settings.
Left click the minus sign  under the plus sign to delete the new material slot.
We are back to our original material. Let's rename it to White.
Left click Material in the ID name bar between the Material slot box and the Preview window.
Type White on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
Both the Material and Material-slot names have changed to white.
We can also add a new material without adding a new material slot.
Left click the plus sign to the right of the 'Material ID name' bar.
A new material is added to the material slot. Rename it to red. You guessed it.
We are going to change the colour of this material from White to Red.
But first let's take a look at the row of buttons below the 'Material ID name' bar.
Surface renders the material of the active object as its surface.
This is the default render material in Blender.
Wire renders the material as a wired mesh showing only the edges of the object's polygons.
This is a useful tool that saves time on modeling and rendering.
We will learn about wired mesh, edges and polygons in detail in more advanced tutorials about modeling in Blender.
Volume renders the material as the entire volume of the active object.
The material settings are different from those for Surface and Wire.
We will see these settings in detail when we use Volume Material in later tutorials.
Halo renders the material as halo particles around the active object.
Again, the material settings have changed.
We will see these settings in detail when we use Halo Material in later tutorials.
Notice that none of these options are visible in the 3D view.
That is because these can only be viewed in the Render Display.
To learn about render display, see the tutorial- Types of windows Properties part 1.
Go back to Surface. We will see the settings for the Surface material.
Below is the  Preview window that shows a preview of the rendered material.
To the right is a column of buttons for different preview options-
Plane,
Sphere,
Cube,
Monkey,
Hair,
and Sky. Now let's change the colour of our material from white to red.
Go to Diffuse. Left click the white bar under Diffuse.
A colour menu appears. We can choose any colour we want from this menu. I am choosing red.
Left click and hold the white-dot in the centre of the colour circle.
Drag your mouse towards the red zone of the circle.
The colour of the cube changes from white to red in the 3D-view and the preview window in the Material panel.
Another method is - left click the  red bar under Diffuse again.
Do you see the three bars named 'R' 'G' and 'B' below the colour circle?
Left click 'R'. Type 1 (one) on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
Left click 'G'. Type 0 (zero) on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
Left click 'B'. Type '0' (zero) on your keyboard and hit the Enter key. Now cube colour is a perfect red.
Similarly, left click the white bar under Specular. Select any colour in the colour menu.
I am selecting green.
So, look.. the shine on the cube has changed from white to light green.
Now, what if I want to use the white material again? How do I get it back?
Go to the Material ID name bar. Here is another sphere icon to the left of the name bar.
Left click the sphere icon. This is the Material menu.
All materials used in the scene are listed here. Right now only two materials are displayed here - Red and White.
Left click White. Once again, the cube has changed from red to white.
Below both Diffuse and specular are the Intensity bars.
By default, Intensity is 0.8 for Diffuse and 0.5 for Specular.
These can be changed as per the type of material finish required.
A Matt finish means less intensity of both Diffuse and Specular.
For example, a natural wood material will have a Matt finish.
A Glossy finish means more intensity of 'Diffuse' and 'Specular'.
For example, a car paint material will have a Glossy finish.
Lambert is the default shader for 'Diffuse' in Blender.
Left click Lambert. This is the Diffuse shader menu.
Here, we can choose our required shader like Fresnel, Minnaert, Toon, Oren-Nayar and Lambert.
Like Intensity, shaders are also different for different types of materials. For example, a glass material will use the 'Fresnel shader'.
Similarly, CookTorr is the default shader for specular in Blender.
Left click CookTorr. This is the Specular Shader menu.
Blinn and Phong are the most common specular shaders used for 90% of materials.
Hardness determines the spread of specularity or shininess of the object.
Left click Hardness 50. Type 100 on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
The specular area is reduced to a small circle on the preview sphere.
Again, left click Hardness 100. Type 10 on your keyboard and hit the Enter key.
Now, the specular area becomes larger and spreads over the preview sphere.
So these are the basic settings of the Material panel.
Rest of the settings will be covered in later tutorials.
Now, you can go ahead and create a new file;
add a new material to the cube and change its colour and name to 'Blue'.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Object Oriented Programming – Methods in Ruby.
In this tutorial, we will learn to use:
instance methods
class methods, accessor methods.
Here, we are using: Ubuntu version 12.04
To follow this tutorial, you must have a working Internet connection.
You must also have knowledge of Linux commands, Terminal and Text-editor.
Before we begin, recall that we had created “ttt” directory earlier.
Then to ruby-tutorial.
Create a directory named oop-methods and cd into it.
What are Instance methods?
Instance methods are those methods that are available to all instances of the class.
Earlier we had studied how to create objects or instances  of a class.
Name it instance_methods.rb.
I have a working example of  implementing instance methods.
I have defined a class named Product in this example.
I have called an initialize method to initialize the instance variables, "name" and "price".
I have also defined instance methods named "name" and "price".
Each of them return instance variables "name" and "price" respectively.
Instance methods are defined just like normal methods.
Earlier we had studied how to create methods in Ruby.
Shortly, we will see how these methods will be available to all instances.
Now, let us implement the logic we have.
Here, I have initialized a Product object and named it as "product_object_1".
I have initialized it with a name value and a price value.
The initializer block passes the values to the instance variables "@name" and "@price".
Now, this product instance or object can use the instance methods name and price.
On invoking these methods, we get the values stored in the instance variables.
Switch to the terminal and type: ruby instance_methods.rb  and press Enter to see the output.
You will see that it will print the values you initialized the object with.
Namely, "laptop" and "35,000".
Next, initialize another instance or object.
Let us name this object product_object_2.
This time, let us give a different set of values for name and price.
Now, let us call the instance methods- "name" and "price" for this object.
Next, let us switch back to the terminal and execute the code like before.
You will notice that it executes successfully and it prints out the new values.
This proves that instance methods are available to all objects of the class Product.
You should now be able to write your own instance methods.
Next, let us look at what class methods are.
Class methods are methods available only to the class.
These methods are not available to instances of the class.
There are different ways you can define class methods.
Let us look at an example.
Name it class_methods.rb.
I have a working example of class methods.
I have defined a Product class like before.
I have also called an initializer, like before.
However, this time I have added an extra argument called description.
I am also using class variables to hold the values, unlike instance variables earlier.
This class will demonstrate to you the 3 different ways one can define class methods.
Checkout the class method declaration for name.
Here, it is defined using the class name "Product".
Then, checkout the second class methods declaration.
Here I have used the "self" keyword.
Next, checkout the third way you can define class methods.
Now let us implement these class methods.
Let us first initialize an object of Product, like before.
This time we are also giving a value for the description.
Now, let us invoke the class methods as shown here.
Now, let us execute the code and inspect the output.
Switch to the terminal and execute the code like before.
You will notice that it will print the values for name, price and description.
Now, you should be able to write your own class methods.
Next we shall see what accessor methods are.
Ruby uses accessor methods to access data, defined within classes.
Accessor methods comprise of setter methods and getter methods.
Setter methods set the values.
Getter methods get those values.
Ruby uses the word attr_accessor to declare these methods.
Let us look at an example of accessor methods.
Name it accessor_methods.rb
I have a working example of  implementing accessor methods.
I have defined a class named Product, in this example.
I have declared attr_accessor for 'name' and 'price'.
That is all that is required to use these types of methods.
Now let us put it to action.
I have initialized a Product object.
Then, I have set the name and price of the product object.
This is possible because the attr_declaration, by default, creates methods for setting values.
I have then attempted to print the values using the getter methods for 'name' and 'price'.
These getter methods were also generated by the declaration of attr_accessor.
Now let us execute the code like before.
You will notice that it prints the values that were set.
By now, you should be able to write your own accessor methods.
One thing to note is that accessor methods are, by default, instance methods.
Thus they can be accessed by different instances of the class Product.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about:  instance methods,  class methods and  accessor methods.
As an assignment:  define a class named Temperature.
Write an instance method using Ruby's accessor method syntax.
This method should calculate the Celsius for the given Fahrenheit.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Cutout animation” using Synfig.
In this tutorial, we will learn to Import an image,
use the Cutout tool on that image and  animate the cutout shapes.
For this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 14.04 OS, Synfig version 1.0.2
We are in the Synfig interface.
Let us first of all save our Synfig file.
Go to File and click on Save.
I will select Desktop as the location.
Then click on Name and change it to Cutout-animation.
Now, let us start creating the cutout animation.
We need to import the image in Synfig.
Open 'Please select a file' window
and select Painting.png. , Then click on Import.
We get the image on the canvas.
Similarly, import the Paint.png file also.
We get two layers named Paint and Painting.
Scale and adjust the images as demonstrated.
We need five copies of the painting layer for this animation.
So, select the layer and click on Duplicate layer icon.
Repeat 4 more times.
We now have the first Painting layer and four copies of the same.
Change the names of the layers as-
Girl's upper body and bucket,
Boy’s hand,
Turn the layers off by unchecking the Show/Hide box.
Select the Girl's upper body and bucket layer and turn on that layer.
Go to Toolbox. Click on the Cutout tool and mask this layer by drawing an outline as demonstrated.
We can adjust the mask by moving the nodes of mask.
One-by-one turn the layers on and use the Cutout tool to mask the other layers likewise.
With the Cutout tool, we can create freehand selection to make a mask on the imported image.
Similarly mask the paint.png layer as well.
Now, press Ctrl and S keys to save the file.
Go to Layers panel and click on the layer- Boy's hand.
Right-click on Mask layer of this layer.
Go to New layer and then to Transform.
Now click on Rotate.
Move the cursor to the 30th frame.
Go to Parameters panel and click on Amount.
Change its value from 0 to -25.
Next, go to Layers panel and click on Girl's upper body and bucket layer.
Right-click on Mask layer of the Girl's upper body and bucket layer.
Go to New layer and then to Transform.
Select Rotate and adjust the rotate handle as demonstrated.
Move the Cursor to the 70th frame and change the Amount value from 0 to -6.14.
Go to the Layers panel and click on Girl's head layer.
Right-click on Mask layer of the Girl's head layer.
Go to New layer and then click on Transform.
Now click on Rotate and adjust the rotate handle as demonstrated.
Move the cursor to the 70th frame and go to Parameters panel.
Change the value of Amount from 0 to -10
We need to rearrange the layers as:
Now, go to Layers panel and click on Mask of the paint layer.
Place the Cursor on 0
Move the mask nodes as demonstrated.
Place the Cursor on 30
Move the mask nodes as demonstrated.
Then click on Seek to begin at the bottom of the canvas.
Now play the animation by clicking the Play button.
Draw a rectangle on the canvas for the background layer.
Next, go to File and click on Render.
Go to the Render setting window.  Click on the Target drop down menu and select the extension as ffmpeg.
Click on End time and change it to 70.
Click on Render.
Go to Desktop. Double click on Cutout-animation folder.
Select Cutout-animation.avi.
Right-click and play the animation using Firefox web browser.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt about Cutout animation in Synfig.
We learnt to : Use the Cutout tool and animate the cutouts.
Locate the Indian flag image which is provided in the Code files link.
Cut the wheel part by using Cutout tool and rotate the wheel.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Forms in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn about:
To practise this tutorial, you should have knowledge of HTML.
If not, then go through the corresponding tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML5
gedit Text Editor
Firefox web browser
However you may, use any other editor or browser of your choice.
Forms are generally used to collect some information from the user.
It can be a
To create web forms, HTML provides some Form Elements for different needs.
The elements are:
Datalist,  Output, Fieldset,  Button
We will learn them one by one with an example.
For this demonstration we will create a simple User Registration form like this.
Open an empty file in any text editor.
Save the file as MyWebForm.html
For this demonstration I have already done this.
To create a form, we have to include the form tag.
It has both start and end tags.
I will add the form tag after the h3 heading tag.
The first information which we want to get from the user is First Name.
Next to the form start tag, type First Name:
To get the input from the user, we will use the input element.
The input tag doesn’t have an end tag.
To get input from the user, we can use any one of the following input types based on our requirement.
To get the name details, we will use the input type as text.
So inside the input tag, type:
Next to the input tag, let me add a break tag for better alignment.
Save the file.
Open the file MyWebForm.html in a web browser.
I will be using Firefox web browser for this purpose.
The text “User Registration Form” is displayed.
Then First Name along with an empty text box is displayed.
Suppose we want to send the collected data to another form or to a database.
We will add the name attribute to the form elements.
Switch to the text editor.
Inside the input tag, next to the type attribute, we will type: name equal to within double quote fname
The input which I’m going to get from the user using this element is First Name.
So, here I have given the value for the name attribute as fname.
However you can give any other unique value of your choice.
Please note that, this will not make any change in the visual appearance.
Notice here, we have written the text “First Name” manually.
HTML has a form element for labels also.
Replace the words “First Name” with the line as shown here.
Here I have used the tag label.
It has both a start and an end.
Inside the tag, I have written First Name along with the bold tag.
Inside the label start tag, I have added an attribute for and fname as a value to it.
Notice that, I have given the same value in label for and input name.
This is to map the label and the input field.
As I mentioned earlier, these will not make any change in the displayed output.
This will be helpful only when we are sending this data to another page or to a database.
So far, I have created a form to get the first name.
Likewise, let me add another piece of code to get the last name.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Now we have the fields to get First Name and Last Name.
Next we will add 3 more fields to get Email address, Password and Retype Password.
Next to last name, type the code as shown.
Here I have set the input type as email.
During the form submission, this will verify whether the input is a valid email address or not.
In the Password field, I have set the input type as password.
So, when we type a password, this input type will display that password as a special character.
So, others cannot see what we are typing.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
Now we have five fields.
Let me enter some values in these fields.
First Name as Praveen
Email as editor.spokentutorial@gmail.com
Enter Password as 12345.
While typing the password, notice that it is showing dots instead of the password.
In the Retype password field, type the same password once again.
Notice that here also we see dots instead of our typed password.
So far we have created a form to fill some details from the user.
To make the form complete, we have to provide a button element, as well.
Button element is used to perform an action when the button is clicked.
For eg:  store the input data in a database
Send the form values to another page or script, to perform another action
or to display some message on the same page.
For this demonstration, we will create a button to display a message after form submission.
Switch to the text editor.
Next to the Retype password line, type the code as shown here.
The button tag has both a start and an end.
I have set the display name for the button as Submit.
Inside the button start tag, I have set an attribute called onclick.
And the value as "alert('Registration Complete')".
If we click the Submit button, then the browser will display a message “Registration Complete”.
Save the file.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
We now see the Submit button.
In this example, I haven’t done any form validation to check for empty fields or incorrect data.
So, without filling the fields, I can simply click on the Submit button.
And the browser will show a popup window with the message “Registration Complete”.
Click on OK to close this popup window.
So far we have learnt to create a simple form to get some data from the user.
We will learn more about forms in the upcoming tutorial.
With this we have come to the end of this tutorial.
Input types: Text, Email and Password in HTML.
To get the following details from the user
And name the button as “Log-in”

Welcome to the series of Blender tutorials.
This tutorial is about Navigation – Camera view.
We shall learn how to navigate the camera in Blender 2.59.
This script has been contributed by Chirag Raman and edited by Monisha Banerjee.
After watching this tutorial,
we shall learn how to change the location of the camera to get a new camera view;
how to roll, pan, dolly and track the camera view
and how to select a new camera view using the fly mode.
By default, when Blender opens, the 3D view is in the User Perspective view.
Now, let's switch to the camera view.
Go to View tab in the bottom left corner of the 3D panel.
Left-click Camera from the menu.
For keyboard shortcut, press numpad 0.
If you are using a laptop, you need to emulate your number keys as numpad.
To learn how to emulate numpad, see the tutorial on User Preferences.
This is the Camera View.
The dotted box is the field of view of the active camera.
All objects inside this dotted box will be rendered.
Render settings shall be covered in a later tutorial.
Blender allows you to position and orient the active camera to match your current view point.
Lets see how to do this.
Press Numpad zero to go back to the perspective view.
You see, the shortcut numpad zero is a toggle to switch-to and from the camera view.
Hold the mouse wheel or the MMB (middle mouse button) and move the mouse to rotate the view to a location where you wish to place your camera.
I have selected this location.
Press Control, Alt & Num-Pad zero.
The camera moves to the new location.
The 3D view switches to the camera view at the same time.
Blender also allows you to perform a few navigational actions on the camera, such as rolling, panning, tracking etc.
We shall now look at these.
Right-click on the dotted box to select the camera.
From here on, you can manipulate the camera like you would manipulate any other object.
Do remember that to perform these actions you need to be in camera view.
The first action we shall see is to roll the camera view.
Press R on your keyboard to enter the object rotation mode.
Now, move your mouse left to right and up and down.
By default, this rotates the camera in its local z-axis, i.e. around the axis that goes into or comes out of the camera view.
Right-click on screen or press Esc on the keyboard to cancel the action.
This will take you back to your previous camera view.
Now, the next action we shall see is panning the camera view.
Panning is in 2 directions – left to right or up and down.
Press R to enter the object rotation mode. Press X twice.
The first X locks the rotation to the global X-axis.
The second X locks the rotation to the local X-axis.
We will discuss about global and local transform axis in detail in subsequent tutorials.</p>
Now move the mouse up and down.
The Camera view pans up and down.
Now, press Y twice.
The first y locks the rotation to the global y axis.
The second y locks the rotation to the local y axis.
Now, move the mouse left to right.
The Camera view pans left to right and vice versa.
Right-click to to go back to the camera view.
Next, we shall dolly the camera view. There are two ways to do this.
First, press G to grab the camera.
Hold the Mouse wheel or the MMB and move the mouse up and down.
Second way, you can move the camera along its local z axis. Press G.
Then press Z twice to lock the camera to the local z axis.
Now, moving the mouse up and down  gives the same effect.
Right-click to to go back to the camera view.
Tracking the camera view left to right or up and down involves moving it along the local X or Y axes.
Press G, press X twice and move the mouse left to right.
The Camera view tracks left to right and vice-versa.
Now press Y twice and move the mouse up and down.
The Camera view tracks up and down.
Right-click to to go back to the camera view.
Blender also provides a fly mode for the camera.
Press Shift, F to enter the fly mode.
Now, you can move the camera view in three ways.
First is using the shortcut keys on the keyboard.
Press W on the keyboard to zoom-in.
Press S to zoom-out.
Press A to move to the left.
Press D to move to the right.
Right-click to go back to the camera view.
Second method is using the mouse wheel or the scroll in fly mode to zoom in and out of the camera view.
Press Shift, F to enter the fly mode.
Scroll the mouse wheel upwards to zoom-in.
For shortcut, press numpad, '+' .
Scroll the mouse wheel downwards to zoom out.
For shortcut, press numpad, '-' .
Right-click to go back to camera view.
Last method is- using the mouse wheel or scroll in fly mode to move the camera view left to right and vice versa.
Press Shift, F to enter the fly mode.
Press D and scroll the mouse wheel up and down.
The Camera view moves left to right and vice versa.
Left-click on the screen to lock the camera view.
Now, this is your new camera view.
So, that wraps up our tutorial on Navigation - Camera View.
Now, in a new file,
change the location of the camera and the camera view. Roll, pan, dolly and track your camera view
and use the fly mode to select a new camera view.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Handling tabs in gedit Text editor.
Use the Side Panel to browse and open files
Insert line numbers and
Let's open the gedit Text editor.
By default, the gedit Text editor has one tab named as Untitled Document 1.
Now, pause the tutorial and type the following code as displayed on the screen.
This is a program in C language.
Let us save the program.
Press Ctrl + S keys simultaneously on the keyboard.
In the Save dialog-box, enter the name as sample dot c.
The extension ‘c’ indicates that it is a C language program.
Select the folder where you want to save the file.
I will select Desktop and then click on Save button.
The tab name has changed to sample dot c.
Did you notice the various colors in the program after you saved the file?
This is because gedit Text editor recognizes the typed code as a C program.
We will learn more about syntax highlighting in later tutorials.
Also, notice the status bar which has changed to 'C'.
We can see that the window name has also changed to sample dot c.
To add a new tab, from the Main menu, click File and New.
A new tab named Untitled Document 1 is created to the right of the document sample.c.
Again, the title at the top of the window has changed to Untitled Document 1.
So, the name of the active tab is displayed as the title of the window.
Now, let’s learn another way to open a new tab.
Click on the New icon in the toolbar.
Another tab Untitled Document 2 has been created.
The numbering of tabs begins at 1 and increments by 1 for each new tab that is opened.
That’s why this tab is numbered 2.
In a similar way, let's create two more new documents.
Now, we have a total of 5 tabs including sample.c.
How do we navigate through these tabs?
Notice, there is a triangular button on both ends of the tab bar.
You can use these buttons to navigate through the tabs.
Let's click on the left triangular button till the document sample.c is visible.
How do we close the tabs?  This is very simple.
From the Main menu, click File and Close.
Alternately, you can simply click on the 'X' button on the tab.
Let's close the Untitled Document 2 and 3 in this manner.
So, we are left with sample dot c, Untitled Document 1 and Untitled Document 4.
Now, let's add two more new documents.
These two new tabs are named as Untitled Document 2 and 3.
The documents are numbered or ordered as shown here.
The ordering may be different in lower versions of gedit.
Such differences in versions will happen and the learner should be prepared to handle these.
Let's rearrange the tabs now.
First, select Untitled Document1.
Press the left mouse button and drop it to the left of the file sample.c.
Release the left mouse-button.
The tab is rearranged.
In the same manner, let us rearrange the tab 2 and 4.
Next, let's learn to move a tab to another window.
First, select the tab sample.c which we want to move.
Then, right-click on the tab and select 'Move to New Window'.
sample.c opens in a new window.
Let's switch from sample.c to the other window with the Untitled Documents.
Go to the Main menu and click View and Side Panel.
The Side Panel opens up on the left side of the window.
You can view the names of all the documents in the side panel.
It is in the same order in which they appear on the window panel.
In the side panel, click on the Untitled Document 2.
That document becomes active now.
Let us rearrange the document in the gedit Text editor window as we did before.
Let’s click on the tab Untitled Document 4.
Click, drag and drop the file after the last tab.
Notice that the document order has now changed in the side panel, too.
To close the side panel, simply click the 'X' button on the top right.
Let's learn how to go to a specific line number in the gedit Text editor file.
Switch to sample.c file.
From the Main menu, click Search and Go to Line.
The Go to Line dialog-box appears on the top right corner of the gedit Text editor window.
In the dialog-box, enter the number 8 and press the Enter key.
The cursor jumps to line 8.  We can also see the line number as 8 in the status bar.
But, it will be easy to locate the cursor if the line number is displayed along with the text.
To display the line numbers of the code, from the Main menu, select Edit and Preferences.
gedit Preferences dialog-box appears.
Click the View tab.
Put a checkmark on Display line numbers option.
Put a checkmark on Highlight current line option. Click on the Close button.
Notice that the line numbers are displayed to the right of the code.
Also, the line on which your cursor is displayed is in bold.
Next we will learn about text wrapping.
A line of code in a program may exceed the length of the gedit Text editor window.
So, it becomes difficult to read the entire line of the text.
Text wrapping helps to wrap the text within the size of the window.
Switch back to the sample.c program.
From the Main menu, click Edit and then Preferences.
Notice that the option Enable text wrapping is checked by default.
Uncheck this box. Click on the Close button.
Let me add a line of code at the end of the program.
Notice that the length of the text has exceeded the size of the window.
Now, let's check the option Enable text wrapping.
The text has been neatly wrapped to fit the window.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarise.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
* Use the side panel to browse and open files
* Insert line numbers and
Create 5 new tabs in the gedit Text Editor.
Save them as One, Two, Three, Four and Five.
Now re-order the tabs as Three, Two, One, Five and Four.
Open the Side Panel
Click the file Five in the Side Panel and enter some text.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Perl and HTML.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create
You can use any text-editor of your choice.
If not, then go through the relevant Perl spoken-tutorials on the spoken tutorial website.
Perl programs which are used on the web are called Perl CGI.
CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface.
It is an interface to serve client-server web communication.
CGI.pm is a Perl module that gets installed along with Perl installation which serves the communication.
CGI.pm has ready to use functions to help developers, to write Perl CGI applications.
When a file in certain directory is requested from web browser,  unlike HTTP server, Perl CGI scripts get executed and send output back to browser to display.
This function is called CGI and the programs are called CGI scripts.
CGI programs can be a Perl script, Shell Script, C or C++ program.
Now, let us see a sample Perl program.
Let me open a file cgiexample.pl in gedit which I have already saved.
In the cgiexample dot pl file, type the following code as displayed on the screen.
use CGI statement tells Perl that we want to use the CGI.pm module in our program.
It will load the module and make a set of CGI functions available for our code.
To start the HTML, we use the method start_html().
“My Home Page” is the page title given for the web page.
We can print any HTML tag using the CGI module.
Heading tags are represented by h1, h2 etc.
The end_html method returns the BODY and  HTML tags.
Now, save the file.
Before we try to run the script via the web server, let's try running it from the command line.
Switch back to the terminal and type: perl cgiexample.pl and press Enter.
The output looks like HTML.
Next, we will test the same script via the web server.
First, let us check whether web server is working or not.
Open your web browser and enter the IP address of the machine and press Enter.
Otherwise, you can type as "localhost".
If everything works fine, you will see something like this in the browser.
If you get any error, then the web service is not installed or it is not in ON status.
Apache HTTP server is installed in my machine.
If it is not installed, execute the below command on the terminal.
Otherwise, please ask your system administrator for server configuration.
Now, we will test the same script via the web server.
For this, we need to follow certain steps.
First, place our program in the cgi-bin directory where the web server will recognize it as a CGI script.
The program filename must end with dot pl or dot cgi extension.
Set permission for the file to execute on the server.
Run the script.
The URL for this program will be as shown in the slide.
Now, we will copy the file to the cgi-bin directory.
For this, type the command:sudo space cp space cgiexample.pl /usr/lib/cgi-bin/.
Enter the password if required.
Next, we need to give the Web-server user 'read' and 'execute' permission for the file.
For this, type: sudo space chmod space 755 space /usr/lib/cgi-bin/cgiexample.pl
Now, our file which is placed in the cgi-bin directory is ready to execute.
Go to the web browser.
Type: localhost/cgi-bin/cgiexample.pl and press Enter.
We can see the output that is executed on the web browser.
Now, let us see another program. This program will add fields to a form and retrieve the entered values to our web page.
In the cgi-bin directory created earlier, I have saved a file 'form.cgi'. I will open this file in gedit.
Now, add the below lines. This program generates a feedback form.
The user has to enter the first name, last name, gender and feedback details.
To begin a form, we are using  start_form() method.
Form field methods are very similar to the standard html tag methods.
To create a textbox in the form, Textfield() method is used with several parameters.
Here “fname”, “lname” are the names of the textbox which get the input from the user.
radio underscore group specifies the radio button with two options “Male” and “Female”.
This is denoted by the parameter hyphen values.
hyphen  default parameter indicates the default selection of the radio button.
popup underscore menu specifies the listbox option.
Submit button is used to submit the entered data to the URL provider.
Clear button is used to clear the form.
The displayform function retrieves the values, we entered in the form.
param() function gives the value of the form field whose name is passed as parameter.
Here “fname” is the name given to the “First Name” textbox.
The value is retrieved and stored in the variable dollar name1.
Let us execute the program now.
Go to the web browser.
Type: localhost/cgi-bin/form.cgi and press Enter.
The feedback form is displayed.
I'll enter data in this form as shown here.
Then, press the Submit button to see the output that is retrieved from the form.
In this tutorial, we learnt how to create  html pages using  CGI  module.
Assignment-In form.cgi program, add checkbox option for languages Java, C/C++ and Perl.
Add textarea option to get the user feedback.
Print the user entered information on the webpage.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Working with data in Calc.
Share the same content on all sheets of the same spreadsheet.
Remove data, replace data, change part of the data in a cell.
Entering data into a spreadsheet can be very labor-intensive.
So Calc provides several tools for making it considerably easier.
The most basic ability is to drag and drop the contents of one cell to another with the mouse.
However Calc also has other tools for automating input, especially for repetitive data.
One such tool is the Fill tool.
This can input data into multiple sheets of the same spreadsheet in one go.
Open the Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file.
In our file, let's copy the data under the heading Cost to the adjacent cells.
Click on the cell which contains the entry 6000 under Cost.
Hold the left mouse button, drag it till the end of the cell which contains the cost entry 2000.
Also select the cells adjacent to the right of the selected cells along with it.
In these adjacent cells we will copy the data.
Now release the left mouse button.
Next, click on the Sheet menu in the menu bar and go to the Fill Cells submenu.
Click on the Fill Right option from the submenu.
Alternatively, you can click on the dropdown of the Column icon in the Standard toolbar.
We see that the data under the heading Cost gets copied into the adjacent cells.
A more complex use of the Fill tool is used for filling some series as data in the sheets
Calc provides default lists for the full and abbreviated
It also enables the users to create their own lists.
Now let’s insert a new heading named Days in our sheet.
Under this, we will display the seven days of the week automatically.
Select the first seven cells below the heading Days.
Now click on the Sheet menu in the menu bar and then on Fill Cells submenu.
Select Fill Series option from the submenu.
The Fill Series dialog box appears.
Now under Series Type, click on the AutoFill option.
In the Start value field, we’ll type the first day of the week, that is Sunday.
The Increment field is already set as 1.
We see that all the days are automatically displayed in the cells.
We can enter only weekdays and months by this method as these are pre-defined in Calc.
Let me demonstrate another method for auto-filling sequential data.
Type Sunday in another cell and press Enter.
This will shift the focus to the next cell in the column.
Go back to the cell where Sunday was typed.
We see a small black box at the bottom-right-hand corner of the cell.
Click on this box with the mouse.
Drag downwards till you see Saturday in the display box on the right.
The cells get autofilled with the weekdays automatically.
This method works for all data that are sequential.
Let's undo these changes.
Next, we’ll create an autofill series of numbers by entering the start, end and increment values.
We will first delete the serial numbers already entered in the cells A2 to A8.
Now click on the Sheet in the menu bar.
In the Fill Series dialog box, under Series Type click on the Linear option.
In the Start value field, we will type the first serial number, that is 1.
In the End value field, we will type the last value to be entered as 7.
Now we’ll set the Increment value as 1, if it is not already 1.
Then click on the OK button.
As an assignment, repeat the above steps with an increment value of 5.
Observe the changes and then undo them.
In all these cases, the Fill tool creates only a momentary connection between the cells.
Once they are filled, the cells have no further connection with one another.
In Calc the same data can be entered in the same cell location on multiple sheets.
This means, there’s no need to enter the same data on each sheet separately.
One can enter them in all the sheets at once.
Let’s learn how to do this.
In the Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods file, our entire data is on Sheet 1.
Now we want Sheet 2 and Sheet 3 to show the same data as in Sheet 1.
To do that, click on the Edit menu in the menu bar and then click on Select.
Now click on Select sheets.
The Select Sheets dialog box appears.
Using the Shift key, select the options Sheet 1, Sheet 2, and Sheet 3.
This takes us back to Sheet 1.
Now let's type something in Sheet 1.
For example, in cell F12 we’ll type “This will be displayed on multiple sheets”.
Now click on the Sheet 2 and the Sheet 3 tab one after the other.
We see that in each of the sheets, cell F12 displays the exact same data.
Let us undo these changes.
Next we will learn about different ways in which we can delete and edit data in cells.
To delete data without removing any of the existing cell formatting, first select the cell.
The data of the cell is displayed in the Input line field.
Click on the Input line once.
Now press the Backspace key on the keyboard.
The data gets deleted.
Let us undo these changes.
To replace data in a cell, select the cell and type over the old data.
The new data will retain the cell’s original formatting.
Let us undo these changes.
We can change part of the data in a cell also, without removing all the contents.
To do so, just double-click on the cell.
Then select the word Rent by double-clicking on it.
Let us undo these changes.
Lastly, save and close the file.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Autofill data using Fill tools.
Share the same content on all sheets of the same file.
And Remove data, replace data, change part of the data in a cell.
As an assignment
Create a Month column besides Time.
Use the Fill Series option to auto-fill till the month of May.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Writing Python scripts.
In this tutorial we will learn,  What is importing ?
Write your own Python modules and
Understand the double underscore name double underscore double equal to within double quotes double underscore main double underscore idiom
Python 3.4.3
IPython 5.1.0 and Gedit text editor
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to  Run basic Python commands on the IPython console
And Use Python modules.
We can write Python modules to bundle functions.
We can then make use of these functions by importing modules to other scripts.
Let us first write a function and save it in a script.
Open any text editor and type the below code.
This Python module has a function to compute gcd of two numbers. Please take care of the indentation.
We have included a text case in the script. This text case will check the GCD function everytime the script is run.
Let us save the file as gcd underscore script.py in the current working directory.
Open a new terminal. Type, ipython3 and press Enter.
Now we will run the script. Type, percentage run gcd underscore script dot py
We get an output which says “Everything is OK”.
It means that the test case checking gcd inside brackets 40 comma 12 equals to 4 is passed.
What if we want to use the gcd function in some other scripts?
This is possible since every Python file can be used as a module.
But first, we will understand what happens when we import a module.
Type, import sys
Now type sys.path
We can see a list of locations. This indicates that Python searches for a module when it encounters an import statement.
The standard modules are built into Python itself.
Otherwise it is found in system locations like slash usr slash lib slash python3.4 slash
The first item in the list is an empty string.
It means the current working directory is also searched.
We can import a module present in the current working directory. Type, import gcd underscore script
Since gcd underscore script dot py is in the current working directory, import will work directly.
Type the print statement as shown here.
We get the gcd of 187 and 391 as output, which is 17.
We can also see the output “Everything is OK” that we added as test code.
This is also executed when we imported gcd underscore script.
The test code is added to check the gcd function.
Test code should only be executed when we run the Python script independently.
To execute the test code when the module is imported to other scripts, we can use double underscore name double underscore variable.
Hereafter I will call this as name variable.
First, we shall look at how to use the variable and then understand how it works.
Now we will add this variable in the script gcd underscore script dot py
Type the following after return a statement
Indent the code properly.
Save the file.
Let us run the code. Type, percentage run gcd underscore script.py
We can see that the test is executed successfully and we get output as Everything is OK
Now we will check the changes by importing the module.
Type, import gcd_script
Note that, once a module is imported, it cannot be imported again in an existing IPython console.
So we will exit the existing IPython console by typing exit.
Open another terminal. Type ipython3.
Now we will import gcd underscore script.py. Type, import gcd underscore script
We can see that now the test code is not executed. Everything is OK is not displayed as output.
The name variable is local to every module. It is equal to main only when the file is run as a script.
Hence, all the code under the block, if name double equal to within double quotes main is executed only when the file is run as a Python script.
Type the following code which checks whether two numbers are relatively prime.
We have imported gcd function from gcd underscore script.
And use it in our calculations without the test code being executed.
Two numbers are relatively prime when their gcd is equal to one.
So we get output as Yes, 11 and 3 are relatively prime.
Every Python file can be run in two ways:  As an independent stand-alone script  or
As a Python module which can be imported by other Python scripts or modules.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,  Import a module.
Use a script as a module
Write test condition using the name variable and
Restart IPython3 if a changed module is to be imported again
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
Second. A module should contain only one function. True or False
And the answers.  First. sys.path contains the locations to search for Python modules.
Second. False. A module can contain a wide range of functions.

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Embedding Audio and Video in HTML.
In this tutorial we will learn:* How to embed an audio and video file in HTML
To practise this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of HTML.
If not, then go through the corresponding tutorials on this website.
To record this tutorial, I’m using
HTML5
gedit Text Editor
You may, use any other editor or browser of your choice.
I’m also using
In HTML, we can embed media files like audio/video in our page.
Upto HTML 4, embed or object tags were used to embed media files.
Also a flash plug-in was required to play them on the browser.
However, in HTML5 we can directly embed media using audio and video tags.
Only 3 commonly used audio and video formats are allowed to be used.
Also the web browser does not require any plugin to play those Audio/Video formats
These are the audio formats supported by HTML5 and their browser compatibility.
These are the video formats supported by HTML5 and their browser compatibility.
Important Note : Before embedding any media, always ensure that you have all the rights to use the file.
Sharing files on the web without reusable permission, is illegal.
Now let us learn, how to embed an audio and video in a HTML document.
For this demonstration, I will be using intro.ogg, intro.wav, intro.mp3, intro.ogg and intro.mp4
Also, I have already written an HTML file named audio-video.html
These files are available in the Code files link of this tutorial.
Open the file audio-video.html in a text editor.
Here, I have included an audio file, intro.ogg using the audio tag.
In case your browser does not support embedded audio file format,  then the text between the audio start and end tags will be displayed.
I have written this audio tag in a different manner.
Instead of defining the file name inside the audio start tag, I have defined it using the source tag.
But both works the same way.
Using the source tag, we can provide multiple sources.
In this case, I have used two source tags for two different file formats.
If the browser supports ogg audio format, then intro.ogg will play.
If the browser supports only mp3 format, then intro.mp3 will play.
Notice, in both cases inside the audio start tag, I have used the attribute controls.
This attribute will provide player controls like play, pause, timeline slider and volume.
I have used two break tags for better alignment.
Observe that the video tag examples look similar to the audio tag.
Instead of audio formats, I have used the video formats here.
Now let us see the output on the browser.
Let me open the file in Firefox web browser.
Here are the audio players.
Next to the audio players, we see the video players.
Notice that, the video players are bigger.
The width and height of the player is according to the video dimensions.
Switch back to the code.
In the code, locate the line for the first video player.
Inside the video start tag, before the controls attribute, type the code as shown.
Here I have set the player’s width as 640 pixels and the height as 360 pixels.
Leave the second player as it is.
Switch to the browser and refresh the page.
The first video player’s dimension is now set based on our inputs.
Also notice that the video automatically sets its dimension to fit without stretching.
Now let us check whether the audio and video are playing or not.
In the first audio player, click on the Play button.
======Patch the audio ======
Yes, the audio is playing!
Click on the Pause button in the player, to pause the audio.
Let me play the second audio now.
=====Patch the audio=====
That is also playing!
In the second audio player, I had given two sources intro.ogg and intro.mp3
How do we know which source is playing?
To cross-check that, right-click on the 2nd audio player.
Then select Save Audio As option.
Notice here in the format dialog box, it says ogg.
Close this dialog box by clicking on the Cancel button at the bottom.
Next let us try to play the videos.
Click on the Play button in the first video player.
=======Patch the audio=====
The video is playing!
Click on the Pause button in the player, to pause the video.
Likewise, let me play the second video.
====Patch the audio====
This is also playing!
In the audio and video players, there are common controls like:
Also in the video player, we have the video fullscreen control.
These controls will be displayed only if we have added the controls attribute in the start tag.
As I was using Firefox web browser, ogg audio and ogv video will be played without any problem.
Let me check the playback in a different browser.
For this part of demonstration, I’m using Mac OS and Safari web browser.
Observe that, the 1st audio player and 1st video player shows error message.
In the code, we have used ogg audio and ogv video for the respective players.
As mentioned earlier, Safari browser does not support ogg and ogv formats.
But, in the second part of the code, we used mp3 audio and mp4 video for the respective players.
That's why, in Safari browser we can see the second audio and video player without any error.
Let me play them and cross verify if they work properly.
====patch the audio====
Both are working fine.
When we try to download the video from the second video player, we get .mp4 video.
When we try to download the audio from the second audio player, we get .mp3 audio.
Like controls, we have some other common media attributes for the audio and video tags.
They are:
Media Group,  Poster ,  Width and  height
You can explore these on your own.
With this we come to the end of the tutorial.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about HTML5 supported audio and video formats.
Provide multiple sources
Add playback controls to the player and  Modify video player dimensions
As an assignment-  Open the file MyHomePage.html which you created earlier
Embed any .mp3 audio and .ogv video of your choice in the file

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Installing an Advanced Theme.
In this tutorial, we will learn to install an advanced theme.
Adaptive theme and Omega are 2 amazing Theme frameworks.
Let's take a look at Adaptive theme.
Note that Adaptive theme is a Basic Theme.
You need to use a Sub-Theme for Adaptive Theme.
Let us install Adaptive Theme.
Depending on when you are watching this video, you might see Drupal 8 up here in green.
Take the Drupal 8 that's in the green and not in red.
Right-click on the tar.gz link.
Select Copy link option.
Let's come back to our website.
Click on Appearance and Install new theme.
Paste the link here and click on Install.
Now, we don't turn this one ON because Adaptive Theme is a Base Theme.
Let's now get a Sub-Theme "Pixture Reloaded".
Scroll down and locate the Drupal 8 version.
When you watch this tutorial, it will be up here in the green section.
Right-click on the tar.gz link and select Copy link.
Back to the site.
Click on Install new theme button.
Paste the link here and click on Install.
Now, click on Install newly added themes.
Scroll down. We will find Adaptive Generator and Adaptive Sub-theme called Pixture Reloaded.
Click on Install and set as default.
Click on Settings.
There is a difference between a simple theme and a base theme with its own sub-theme.
There are settings for almost everything here.
We can change just about anything.
For instance, we can have Responsive menus,
Fonts from Google or Typekit,
Separate styles for Titles,
Image alignment,
Shortcode CSS Classes,
Mobile Blocks - which allow us to hide blocks on mobile devices.
Slideshows are supported.
Touch icons, Custom CSS, more Developer tools and Legacy browser settings for IE 6 to 8.
Please use these with caution.  Don't enable them unless you need them.
Under Extensions, in the left panel, we have Responsive menus, Fonts,
Image Settings for-
It recognizes all of those Content types.
Let me click on EVENTS.
This allows us to align our images in our Events Content type.
For instance, whether we want them always to be floated to the left or to the right.
Back to the left panel- Shortcodes and Markup Overrides.
There are more options here, below.
Click on LAYOUTS and then on PAGE (DEFAULT).
Now, click on WIDE option.
This allows us to set up all the layouts with the Block regions and also to define the Media queries right here, inside the theme.
We will need some time to set this up properly.
Now, click on COLOR SCHEME.
There are many predefined color schemes.
But if you don't like the ones that come with it, then you can build your own color scheme.
Lastly, there are the normal Basic settings.
This is an amazing base theme and sub-theme for our Drupal site.
We have not really made any changes here.
But let's go and take a look at our Home page.
We see a brand new look and feel for our Home page.
We will need to go into Structure and check our Block layout.
We have used the Sub-Theme "Pixture Reloaded".
There are no Sidebar regions here.
Everything in Pixture Reloaded is just listed this way.
Maybe it was not the best choice for our demonstration.  But you get the idea of how powerful it is.
We can just go in and set up all of those options using this advanced theming engine.
That's the theme framework – Adaptive theme and Pixture Reloaded.
You can play around with these to understand them thoroughly.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to install an advanced theme.

Hello and welcome to the tutorial- Introduction to QCAD -2D drafting tool.
In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the basics of QCAD tool and its interface.
Let's look at what is QCAD? It is an application for computer aided drafting (CAD), in two dimensions.
Using QCAD, you can create technical drawings such as plans for buildings, interiors, mechanical parts or schemas and diagrams.
Community edition of QCAD is available freely for download at:
For this tutorial, I am using: GNU Linux operating system Ubuntu version 10.04 LTS
and QCAD Community Edition version 2.0.5.0
If you do not have it installed on your system,
you can do so by going to  System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
and, at the search box, look for QCAD.
And install these applications.
For more information on how to install software, using synaptic,
please refer to spoken tutorial available on this website: www.spoken-tutorial.org.
Once installed, to start QCAD in Ubuntu 10.04, go to Applications -> Accessories -> terminal
and at the prompt, type: “qcad” and hit 'Enter'.
This will launch the application in 10.04 version.
For other Ubuntu versions, it is available under Applications menu.
Menu items and tool bar, drawing objects
A typical QCAD window looks like this.
It has a standard menu bar on top.
Options like Draw, Dimension, Modify and Snap are QCAD specific.
On the left side is the tool bar which is used to draw objects.
At the very bottom is the status bar which displays various information about the current drawing.
Notice as my mouse is moving in the drawing area.
Coordinate widget on the extreme left side is displaying absolute and relative position of my mouse cursor.
Just above the status bar is the command line for QCad
Which is used to put in exact co-ordinates to draw objects.
At the right side is the layer list and the block list.
These list the layers and blocks related information for the current drawing.
We will look at these in detail in subsequent tutorials.
Right in the middle is the drawing area,
black in color with dots.
Dots signify the grid. At any time you can choose not to view grid by going on to top option and click on this 'grid' icon to not to show the grid.
Click it back again to make it visible.
Similarly, all other windows as status bar, command line, block and lists can be enabled/disabled by going to top menu. View -> Views
and select check box in front of the window of your choice.
QCAD uses Cartesian and polar coordinates system to draw objects.
To draw objects, we use tool bar from left or this can also be accessed from top menu → Draw option.
Let's start by drawing a line. From the tool bar, click on the Line icon.
There are numerous options to choose from.
Let's click on Line with two points. Notice the command prompt is asking to specify first point.
Move your mouse cursor on the drawing area.
There are two things happening now - 1. mouse cursor has changed into white cross hair.
2. There is blue circle appearing right below the mouse cursor.
It is basically hopping from grid to grid as I move my mouse, waiting for me to select.
I can click left-mouse-button to click for the start of the line
and click again for the line to end. Line is drawn.
Notice, if I keep clicking further it will start drawing line, as QCAD is still in line command.
For this, I need to come out of that command.
To come out of any command, you press either 'Enter' or 'Esc' button on keyboard twice or double-click right-mouse-button,
you will be out of any command.
Similarly, you can draw parallel lines, horizontal lines, vertical lines, parallel lines with distance.
Let's see this option. When I choose this option, I need to specify distance between the lines and number of lines.
Let's say 10 here and no. of lines I want 3.
You will move mouse cursor closer to entity in relation to which you would want parallel lines to be drawn.
Once satisfied, I can confirm selection by clicking on left-mouse-button and lines will be drawn on the board.
Now, let us see the Arc tool. From the tool bar, choose Arc.
I am choosing Arc with center point and angles.
From Snapping option, let's choose Snap to grid.
Notice, command prompt is asking to specify center; left click to specify center.
Now it is asking to specify radius, I can enter say 30.
Now, specify start angle and click again for end angle and arc is drawn.
Double-click right-mouse-button to come out of that command.
Let's try and draw circle. Go to the Circle icon from tool box, click on it. I am using Circle with centre and radius.
Again from the Snapping option, choose 'Snap to grid'.
Command line is asking to specify circle's center.
Go on the grid and left-click to specify center. Circle is drawn.
It is drawn with previously specified radius. If I want to change, I can change and draw new circle with different radius.
Unless you come out of that command, it will keep on drawing circles.
So, double-click right-mouse-button and you are out of that.
Now that my drawing has become busier, I can use zoom from top menu → view -> Zoom in to Zoom in on the more details.
and view-> Zoom out to see the wider extent.
Zoom is a very essential command because it is very useful when you draw details.
Similar effects can be achieved by rolling a middle-mouse-button to zoom in and out.
Or I can also use View ->(third option) Auto zoom to fit the drawing in the given area.
Let's try drawing a new file. Let me clear this area.
For this, I click at one corner select and then from top menu -> modify -> Delete selected.
Every drawing in QCAD starts at absolute 0,0 position; it is marked by red cross hair on the drawing area.
Every other point is drawn in relation with this point.
Before starting any drawing, it is important to set drawing preferences for QCAD, to know which units you are using, what grid size you would want.
For this, you go to Edit- and there are Application Preferences and Current drawing preferences.
are the ones which apply to entire QCAD application, rather than just a single drawing.
You can change background, grid colour, meta colour, language options and set the default Units that you want.
Let's say 'meter' here and click 'OK'.
Now, let's go to Edit -> set Current Drawing preferences: These apply only to current drawing and once you close the drawing, these need to be set again.
Paper applies only when we want to print a drawing.
Units: You can set units for that particular drawing. Let's say 'Inch' here. Decimal, precision can be 0.00.
Grid: You can either choose to show grid or not show grid. You can give grid size as .5x.5, specific size that you want.
Dimensions: Are useful when you want to start dimensioning on the drawing. Extension line, text height all these points matters when you want to show text.
If you think text height or the line or arrow is too small, you can always revisit this area later.
I am setting some things now, after you are done, click 'OK'.
It is better to save the drawing
We go to File -> save as and select the directory where you would want to save it.
I want to save it as "qcad-dwg". Notice, it is saving it as "dxf" format. Document Exchange Format, which is QCAD native.
Click on Save, it saves the drawing.
Let us start with our drawing.
We will draw rectangle and then cut it in half by drawing a line in the middle and draw circle exactly in the centre.
Draw rectangle: Go to tool bar-> Line option. select Rectangle.
From the Snapping options, choose 'snap to grid'.
Move cursor over the drawing area and left-click for the first corner of rectangle and click away for second corner .
Rectangle is drawn. Double-click right-mouse-button to come out of that command.
Draw line going through middle: Now we want to draw line exactly in the middle, cutting it in two halves.
This is where snapping options will be useful.
Let's go, click on line - Line with two points.
Now, from grid options- since I want it exactly at middle, I choose 'snap to middle point'.
And I go on the top line, notice it is snapping exactly to the middle point of the top line, click there.
Go on the bottom line, click again. The line is drawn cutting the rectangle in two halves.
Draw circle in the center of rectangle: Now let's draw circle, in the center of the rectangle.
Click on Circles icon and I am choosing Center and Radius.
Go over here, if you want circle to occupy entire width.
I know my grid is .5x.5 and there are 6 divisions. So, that means my rectangle is 30x40.
So, I put radius 15 to cover entire width and notice, I need to click on the snap to 'centre point'.
And left-click to confirm. Circle is drawn exactly in the centre of the rectangle.
Now that our drawing is ready, so, let's add dimensions. We always add dimensions to new layer so that we can keep it separate.
Click on '+' sign to add new layer. Go to 'Dimensions'.
Give it a different colour so that we can identify it separately from the rest of the drawing.
You can use type 'dash', then you go to top menu, 'Dimensions' Horizontal first. From the snapping option, click on 'end point'. Click on first point of the line, then second point.
Now to place dimensions away from the line, from snapping option, I can choose 'snap to grid' or free positioning and place it away. Left-click once.
Again to place vertical, go to dimensions -> vertical, from end point.
Place it again away by using 'free positioning'
This way, if I have it on different layer, I can always, when drawing gets busier if click on Eye icon to not to show that layer and see the drawing clearly.
and when you want it back, click back on the eye icon again to make it visible.
Now, if I want to change attributes of any object-
I click on that object, go to Modify -> attributes.
Now, once the selection is made, click on the arrow.
Let's say I want to change color to 'Red'
Width: let's increase it and the type: make it 'Dash and dot', click 'OK'.
The attributes are changed. Let's save the drawing.
Now that you are familiar with the QCAD basic tool bar and drawing objects,
I would like you to draw a rectangle as shown in the figure, of size 20x30
with center line of type dash and dot and red in colour.
Draw two parallel lines which are 5 units apart.
Add dimensions on a new layer.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on  Functions in PERL.
PERL functions, functions with arguments
functions with return values.
Perl 5.14.2 and
You should have basic knowledge of  variables, comments, loops, conditional statements and data Structures in PERL.
We will first see some simple PERL functions.
In PERL, functions, also called as  subroutines, are declared with sub keyword.
The definition of a declared function is written between curly braces.
This function does not take any  arguments.
And, it does not return anything.
Note: function definition can be written anywhere in the script or in another module.
This module must then be included in the script, to use this function.
To include the module file in the script, one has to use the following syntax:
use ModuleFileName semicolon
Let us understand this using a sample program.
Open a file in your text editor and name it as simpleFunction dot pl.
Here is my  simpleFunction dot pl  file in gedit.
Here, we are just calling a function which we have defined.
Then the execution control is passed to that  function.
This is the declaration & definition of the function.
This function will print out the given text.
Save your file.
Then switch to the terminal and execute the PERL script by typing:
perl simpleFunction dot pl
The output will be as shown on the terminal.
Now, let us see a function with arguments.
Let us understand this function using a sample program.
Open a file in your text editor and name it as functionWithArgs dot pl.
Here is my functionWithArgs script in gedit.
Here, we are calling the function with  arguments 10 and 20.
The passed arguments are caught in '$var1' & '$var2'.
@_ is a special Perl variable. We will cover its details in future tutorials.
This function performs the addition of 2 variables and prints the answer.
Save your file.
@_is a special Perl array.
This array is used to store the passed arguments.
Similarly, we can catch the passed  arguments in  variables as:
$var1 space = space  shift @_ semicolon
$var2 space  = space  shift @_  semicolon
shift @_ removes the element at first position from @_ array
and assigns it to a  variable.
Another way is: $var1 space  =  space dollar underscore open square bracket zero close square bracket semicolon.
$var2 space  =  space dollar underscore open square bracket 1 close square bracket semicolon.
The above mentioned way is similar to the fetching elements of @_ array using index.
Now, switch to terminal and execute the script by typing:
perl functionWithArgs dot pl and press Enter .
The output is as displayed on the screen.
Now, let us look at a function which returns a single value.
Let us understand the same, using a sample program.
Let me switch to funcWithSingleRtrnVal dot pl script in gedit.
Open a file in your text editor and type the following piece of code as shown.
Here, we are calling  addVariables function with parameters 10 and 20.
The return value of the  function is caught in '$addition' variable.
This function does the addition of the passed parameters and returns the answer.
Save the file.
Now, let us execute the script.
So, switch to terminal and type:
perl funcWithSingleRtrnVal dot pl  and press Enter.
Now, let us see a function which returns multiple values.
Let us understand the same, using a sample program.
In gedit, I have opened a file and named it as  funcWithMultipleRtrnVals dot pl.
Please do like-wise in your text editor.
Now, type the following piece of code as shown.
Here, we are calling addVariables function with parameters 10 and 20.
The return values of the function are caught in variables  $var1, $var2 and  $addition.
This function does the addition and returns the passed parameters and the resultant answer.
This illustration demonstrates how we can return an array from a function.
Similarly, this demonstrates how hash can be returned from a function.
Save your file.
Now let us execute the Perl script on the terminal by typing:
perl funcWithMultipleRtrnVals dot pl
Perl  provides several inbuilt functions.
We learnt some of them in earlier tutorials. For e.g-  arrays, Hash, sort, scalar, each, keys etc.
Calling inbuilt functions is similar to calling any other function which we define.
e.g sort open bracket @arrayName close bracket semicolon.
Try incorporating some inbuilt functions in the sample programs we used.
And observe their outputs.
functions in Perl
functions with arguments and
functions which return values using sample programs.
Write a function which takes 3 arguments.
Perform some action on these arguments.
Return the result of the action performed on the arguments and print the same.
The Spoken Tutorial project team: * Conducts workshops using spoken tutorials.
"Spoken Tutorial" project is a part of the "Talk to a Teacher" project.
This is Amol, signing off.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and format text using Inkscape.
We will also learn how to create a simple flyer at the end.
Text can be inserted using the Text tool from the Tool box.
We can add text in two ways-
First we will learn about Regular Text. Click on the Text tool and then click on the canvas.
Type the word Spoken. Observe the text box grows to accommodate the text.
Line breaks have to be added manually. So, press Enter to go to the next line and type “Tutorial”.
To move the word to the previous line, keep the cursor before the alphabet 'T'. Now press backspace and add a space between the 2 words.
In a similar way, type:
Next, we will learn to insert text through Flowed text.
This time, I will copy text from a LibreOffice Writer file that I had saved earlier.
Press Ctrl + A to select the entire text and press Ctrl + C to copy that.
Now, come back to Inkscape. Make sure the Text tool is selected.
Click on the canvas and drag to form a rectangular or square text area.
Notice, a blue rectangle box is formed on the canvas on releasing the mouse button.
Now, inside the text box, notice the text prompt which is blinking on the extreme top left corner.
Press Ctrl + V to paste the copied text.
Observe, the color of the text box changed to red.
This is because the inserted text exceeds the boundaries of the text box.
We can correct this using the small diamond handle at the right corner of the text box.
Click and drag it till the text box color changes to blue.
The last sentence of the text is clubbed with the previous sentence.
Press Enter twice at the beginning of the last sentence to separate it.
Next, let us learn the various formatting options available for texts. Click on the word “Spoken Tutorial”
Go to Main menu. Click on Text and then on Text and Font option.
A dialog box appears with two options – Font and Text. Under the Font tab there are several options.
Font family lists all the available fonts. You can select any of the available fonts of your choice.
We can preview the selected font in the preview box here. My choice is Bitstream Charter font.
There are four Style options- Normal, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. Choose the style as per your requirement. I will choose Bold.
To change the Font size, simply click on the drop-down arrow and select the size. Since this is the title, I will select a bigger font, say 64.
Next is the Layout.
We will learn about this in a while as the preview is not visible for this option.
Now, click on the Text tab next to the Font tab. Here, a preview window is seen with the text inside it.
Any modifications to the text can be done here.
Click on Apply and close the dialog box. Observe the text is now formatted.
We can change the text color using the color palette at the bottom. Let me click on maroon color.
Next, select the text for the URL i.e.
Text formatting options are available in the Tool controls bar too.
I will change the font to Bitstream charter, Font size to 28 and color to Blue.
Now, let us choose the paragraph text.
If the Text tool is already selected, you can simply click on the text to go inside the text box.
I will change the Font size of the text to 25.
Click and drag the diamond handle to move the text inside the canvas.
Next, let us align the texts.
The four icons next to the Italic icon on the Tool controls bar help to align the text to the
The fourth option will justify the text within the boundaries of the text box. I will click on left align before proceeding further.
We can align the text using the Align and distribute option too.
Go to the Main menu and then click on Object menu. Then click on Align and Distribute option.
Now, we will move the word Spoken Tutorial to the centre. So click on it.
First check if the Relative to parameter is set to Page.
So, click on Centre on vertical axis. Observe the text is now aligned to the centre.
Let us add some more text in the empty space at the bottom.
Type FOSS Categories. Now, align it to the centre of the page by clicking on Centre on vertical axis.
Type some FOSS names such as Linux, LaTeX, Scilab, Python separately and randomly on the canvas.
Now, let us align all these texts in a single row with equal space.
Select the 4 texts using the Shift key. Click on Align baseline of text and Distribute baseline of text horizontally.
Notice the gaps between the words are not equal.
The first letter of the first word and the first letter of the second word are equally spaced. But the words themselves are not equally spaced.
This works in a similar way for vertical texts too.
These options may be useful in certain situations.
We will make the spaces between the words equal.
To do so, click on the fourth icon in the first row under Distribute. Now the spacing is equal between the words.
Next, we will learn to adjust the space between the lines of the paragraph text.
Double-click on the paragraph text to go inside the text box.
The Spacing between lines icon on the Tool controls bar helps reduce or increase space between lines.
Observe what happens when I increase the spacing.
Let me keep the line spacing as 1.50.
The next icon helps to adjust space between letters. Again, click on the up and down arrows and observe the changes.
Let me keep the space parameter as 0.
Observe there is an empty space in both the vertical corners of the canvas. We can fill them with some text.
Type a sentence: "Learn Open Source Software for free". somewhere outside the canvas.
Change the Font to Ubuntu. Font size to 22 and make it Bold.
Now click on the last icon i.e. Vertical text on the Tool controls bar.
Notice that the text is now aligned in vertical direction.
Click on the text using the Selector tool and move it to the left corner of the canvas.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate it and move the copy to the other corner of the page using the Ctrl key.
Now, we will add bullet points to the text within the paragraph.
Inkscape does not provide bullet or number lists for text. So one has to create bullet points manually.
Click on the ellipse tool. Draw a small circle of red color.
Now move this bullet to the first line of the paragraph. Duplicate it and move its copy to the next sentence.
Repeat this for all sentences.
Now, we have all our text as per our requirement.
Lastly, let us do some beautification to make it look like a flyer.
Here is the completed flyer.
I have added borders to the top and bottom. And covered the texts with a rounded rectangle and ellipse shapes.
You can use your creativity to create different layouts and designs for your flyer.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
We also learned to create a simple flyer.
Here is an assignment for you-
Create a flyer like this.
Create star using star tool with 10 corners.

Ramu gets up in the morning and starts getting ready for school.
He is sleepy but manages to pick up his brush, applies paste and starts brushing.
He brushes quickly as he needs to rush to school.
He rinses and rushes for his bath. And gets ready.
Ramu’s mother calls him for breakfast.
Ramu eats his breakfast.
The food gets stuck between his teeth and he screams out loudly.
Mother gives him water and tells him to rush for school as he is already late.
Ramu, still in pain, picks his bag and leaves home.
He meets a friend on his way.
Seeing him in pain, his friend Suresh  asks him what is wrong.
Ramu narrates the incident.
Suresh listens to Ramu patiently.
Then he tells him about a dentist uncle who stays in his neighborhood.
Suresh promises Ramu to take him to the dentist uncle after school.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on bridging the digital divide.
Here we will talk about the ways of maintaining good oral hygiene, the primary care and consulting the dentist.
On the way back from school, Suresh and Ramu meet the dentist.
The dentist examines Ramu’s teeth and informs him that he has a small cavity.
He then tells the children about the causes of cavities-
Food stuck between teeth
Not brushing teeth properly
Soft drinks which contain more % of citric acid.
The dentist then suggests measures that will help to avoid this kind of pain -
Eating food rich in mineral and calcium.
Brushing your teeth properly.
Brushing twice a day.
Rinsing your mouth after every meal.
A dental visit every six months is considered good for all age groups.
Visit a dentist:  If the teeth are uneven, crowded or jumbled.
If cavities are observed in the teeth.
If your teeth are sensitive to hot and cold foodstuff.
Gently brush the outer and inner side of the chewing area.
Also brush the tongue to maintain good breath and to get rid of germs.
Miswak is a chewing stick cut from a twig of the peelu tree.
The stick needs to be chewed on.
Then this chewed stick can be used as a natural brush.
Remember, taking care of your teeth and visiting a dentist from time to time helps maintain good oral hygiene.
Thanking you for listening and STAY SAFE.

Welcome to mySQL part 5. To echo our data to the user and to display the results from this, we'll need to use while statement.
As I mentioned, we have created a $row variable and this is "= mysql_fetch_assoc".
This is creating an associative array from our "extract" query which is here.
So, we are selecting everything in the  "people" table and ordering them by "id" in ascending order.
Inside our while, since we wrote $row as an array and it's an associative array, row[0] will be wrong because these are numeric.
These are numeric id tags and instead of this we'll use our field names, since this is associative.
So, instead of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 we'll be using the actual name.
Let's create variables from this. Let me say $id and then $firstname equals, we are using the same structure throughout.
So, it's quite easy to copy and paste this.
Let's indent this.
So we have 5 altogether.
So that's five and then let's just change. This is a lazy act!
But it's just a lot quicker to do this way.
So $lastname and we have the date of birth ($dob). We also have the $gender.
We have all our data and now how do we use this?
We need to use the echo command.
There might be a loop inside the middle, at the moment. So, anything we echo out will be repeated.
Every record we say and that's right too. We'll repeat this code.
For example, I say "Text" here. There are currently 4 records.
After refreshing this page, you should see Text echoed out 4 times.
By typing out 4 times, this piece of code here, represents every loop.
Therefore we can incorporate for example, $id or $firstname or any other, that we have extracted from the database using our associative array.
Now I'll write: $firstname $lastname was born on $dob for date of birth and is and I'll put $gender up there.
Not forgetting our line-break. I'll refresh our page.
Then we have our set of data structured using the variable names.
We have given in the correct order and also it has been repeated through for every record we have.
Okay, we have just given out the content of our table using this star, declared by this asterisk, where it collects every single data on every record.
Now let me do this. I'll say if $gender== "F"  then $gender= "Female" .
The actual spelling of that and then let us say else $gender= "Male". This is just rewriting the variable depending on the value.
If we refresh now, we can see this has changed to male Male and female Female. We also have some interesting ways of displaying this data.
At the moment, I'm selecting from the people table and ordering by id and ascending order.
I can also order by descending id. You can see that this switches this data around.
We can also order it by firstname. This will put this in descending alphabetical order and ascending will put this in ascending alphabetical order.
So, we got A, D, E, and K.
You can do the same with the surname.
You could do the same with anything. Even date of birth, as long as you include this over here.
Another thing to do is, let me just take this back to id and have this as descending. We can use this LIMIT 1 or we can say LIMIT 2, 3 or 4.
Now I'll LIMIT 1 for the purpose of this.
Now let's have 1 to let the user of the page know the last person that was inserted into this table.
So I say echo here.
echo "Last person to be inserted into table was..." and I'll leave it like that and add a line-break.
I'll just echo out the first and last name. Ok.
So, here we can see that there is a lot of confusion.
"Last person to be inserted.." Yes, in fact it does work!
It is already typed in the "LIMIT" command.
What I've done is by limiting this by 1 in descending order of id - the id is incremental - I get 4 at the top and if we are limiting this by 1, 4 will be the only record that is selected.
Therefore, the last person in the table, as per the last record displayed, will have its value echoed out.
This while will only return 1 data value.
Since we are returning 1 data value here, we are confused by these.
This is one command here, SELECT asterisk (*) FROM "people" , ORDER BY id DESC is another and LIMIT 1 is yet another.
We don't use commas or anything. This is just how we write our code inside our query.
Okay, just to test this- I'll insert just using the Insert function in php MyAdmin and I'll insert another record.
For example, let's type in "David Green" and our date of birth could be random.
It doesn't really matter what we type in here. We say Male.
I came down here and submit this data.
Click on Browse and we have a new value here.
When we come back here and refresh, that will change to "David Green".
So, this is really useful if you have a website in which you are putting videos or personal pictures.
You can just place in the last thing the user had inserted.
Or may be the last person that has been registered on your website or anything.
Possibility of using this is endless.
Basically how to echo out data and how to manipulate it by just using mysql query.
In the next part, we will allow our user to specify which data they want to show.
We will create some html forms  to enable them to do this.
This will let them select a name from the database or table of their choice.
So, join me in the next part.Bye for now.  This is Juanita Jayakar, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Display counter using Arduino.
To follow this tutorial, you should have:
In an earlier tutorial, in this series, we had created a circuit using Arduino and LCD.
Here, we will add a pushbutton and make a simple counter.
We have already learnt about the working of pushbutton in an earlier tutorial.
Now, let us learn the connection circuit details.
A pushbutton is connected to a 100 ohm resistor.
The pushbutton is connected to pin number 7 and a 100 ohm resistor is connected to the ground.
All other connections are exactly the same as in our previous experiment.
This is the live setup of the connection as shown in the circuit diagram.
Now, we will write a program in the Arduino IDE. So, let’s switch to the Arduino IDE.
First, we need to include the Liquid crystal library.
I have initialized a variable lcd of type LiquidCrystal.
Here, pin number 12 is initialized as Register Select and pin number 11 as Enable.
The next 4 parameters represent data lines of LCD.
In the void setup function, type: lcd.begin 16 comma 2 as shown.
Next we will setup the pin number 7 as INPUT. Type the code as shown.
In another way, we can store the pin number in a variable pbutton.
Now we will write the code for void loop.
We will write a simple 'if' statement to check whether the pushbutton is pressed or not.
Before displaying the count, let us check the status of the button.
This command will set the cursor position in the LCD.
We will now compile and upload the program. Now, I will press the pushbutton.
Here, we see the message “button pressed” in the LCD.
Next, we will modify the program to set a counter.
We need a variable for counter. Now, we will initialize the variable count to zero.
Modify the print statement as shown here.
Let us now compile and upload the program. Now, I will press the pushbutton.
It didn't work as expected. We see a different count displayed here.
This is because we specified the status for button pressed.
The output shows the incremented number based on the button pressed time.
So, we will write a 'while' statement as shown here.
This will display the count when the pushbutton is in pressed state.
When you release the button, the state is LOW and it will come out of the 'while' loop.
The program starts with initialization of the LCD. We have the variable pbutton and count.
Inside the void setup function, we have initialized the LCD with 16 columns and 2 rows.
In the void loop function, we are checking the condition whether the pushbutton is HIGH or not.
When the pushbutton is pressed, the cursor is set to position zero comma zero.
The lcd.print statement will print the count value.
When the button is released, it will break the while loop and come out of the loop.
Again, if you press the button, the next iteration begins and it increases the count.
Now, I'll press the button once and release it.
Again I'll press and release the button. You can see that the count is increased whenever the button is pressed.
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
Do the following assignment.
The Spoken Tutorial Project tTeam:
This tutorial has been contributed by FOSSEE' and Spoken Tutorial Project, IIT Bombay'. Thanks for watching.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on how to add an Item type in the Koha interface.
In this tutorial, we will learn about Item types and  how to add an Item type.
To follow this tutorial, learner should have knowledge of Library Science.
And, You should have Admin access in Koha. If not, please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website.
Let us begin. Let me switch to the Koha interface.
Recall that we had created a Superlibrarian Bella.
We will now login with username Bella and her password.
Now we are inside the Koha interface as Superlibrarian Bella.
Before we move ahead, let’s first understand what are Item Types.
Item types typically refer to the material in the library, such as-
Every Item type in Koha has a Collection code assigned to it.
This code uniquely identifies that Item type.
Let us learn to add a new item type.
On the Koha Home page, click on Koha Administration.
Go to the section Basic parameters and click on Item Types.
Click the ' New Item Type' button at the top of the Item types administration page.
In the Item type field, enter a code for the new item type that you want to add.
I will type REF.
The Description field is the description of the item type.
So here, I will type "Reference". I will skip Search category field.
Next is Choose an icon:.
Click on the tab bridge .
Here, from the below given options, click on the icon to be associated with the item type.
I will select this Reference icon.
Next, we will learn how Hide in OPAC: helps.
Let’s say a book is damaged and/or has to be kept back for binding purpose.
In such cases, the option Hide in OPAC, will make the book invisible to all the users.
As per your requirement, check or uncheck the checkbox for Hide in OPAC:. I will leave the checkbox blank.
Use the 'Not for loan' option for items which are kept in the library but not circulated.
For e.g :  Reference books,  Rare books , Dictionary etc.
You may enter an amount to be charged in the Rental charge field, if you wish to.
I will not enter any fee, as rental fee is not required to be charged on most items.
If you wish to enter a fee, then remember to enter a valid number only.
Next is the 'Checkin message:' text field.
Checkin message depends on the type of the particular item.
The options could be- Book ,  Serial, Cds/DVDs,  Bound Volume,  Microfilm etc.
In the field Checkin message:, I will type Bound Volume.
This is followed by Checkin message type:.
Depending upon the item type, select a message or an alert for the item.
Remember, as per the selected option a message or an alert will be displayed when check-ins are done for this particular item.
I will select- message.
Next is SIP media type.
So here, I’am skipping SIP media type.
In the Summary field, write a summary of the respective item , if you want to.
I will type-
Lastly, click on Save changes button.
A new page Item types administration opens up.
All the details that were filled for the new item type, appear in a tabular form  on the page Item types administration.
Some important things to note are-
Collection codes assigned to item types cannot be edited.
Description of the item type can be edited.  Once an item type is used by items in the library, it cannot be deleted.
As an assignment- add a new item-  Book and   Serial  to your library.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Bouncing Ball animation” using Synfig.
In this tutorial, we will learn about the interface of Synfig.
We will also learn to:  draw basic shapes and fill color,
add keyframes and waypoints,
do a ball animation with squash effect,
render the output in gif format.
This is the interface of Synfig.
The Menu bar is located at the top.
The standard toolbar is located below the Menu bar. Here, we will find some of the shortcut and handles options.
This is followed by horizontal and vertical rulers.
Just below the Tool box, notice there are two boxes.
The upper box is in black color. And the tool-tip says it is the Outline color.
The lower box is in white color. And the tool-tip says it is the Fill color.
In the center, is the canvas. This is where we will do our animation.
Below the canvas, is the Animation panel.
Here, we can see the buttons that are related to animation.
At the bottom left of the interface, is the Parameters panel.
Parameters will be visible once we create an object on the canvas.
Next to this, is the Keyframes panel. Here we will add the keyframes.
On the right of this panel, we can find the Time track panel.
Here, we will be able to see the waypoints and the key frame indications of the animation.
Waypoints will be visible once we create an animation on the canvas.
At the right bottom of the interface, is the Layers panel.
Above the Layers panel, we can see the Tool options panel.
And above this panel, you can find  Canvas browser,
Palette editor,
Navigator and   Info panels.
We can get accustomed to using all these, as we go along.
Now, let us start with our first animation.
First, we will create a background.
Go to Tool box. Click on the Rectangle tool.
Notice the change in the Tool options panel.
Under the Layer Type, we can see many icons.
Select Create a region layer icon. For this demo, we will leave the other settings as it is.
Now draw a rectangle covering 3/4th of the canvas, as demonstrated.
Please note that the default fill color is white which implies that if we draw outside the canvas, it will be difficult to spot the object.
Notice that a layer is created in the Layers Panel.
Synfig gives it a name, by default. Here it says “Rectangle060Region”.
Giving meaningful names to layers is always a good practice.
It helps us to locate a particular object from among the long list of layers.
You will appreciate this more when we create complicated animations.
Come back to the Synfig interface.
I will change this default layer name to Sky.
So, click on the name, type Sky and press Enter.
The name of the layer is now sky.
Please note that the cursor is very sensitive. Hence, avoid clicking randomly to prevent duplication of the previous action.
The parameters for the rectangle are created in the Parameters panel.
Locate the Color parameter and double-click on the Value column. Immediately, a dialog box appears.
Change the color to blue by dragging the RGB scrollers.
Now, close this dialog box.
Next, click on the Transform tool.
Then click outside the canvas to deselect the Sky layer.
Now again select the Rectangle tool.
Create another rectangle in the lower part of the canvas.
Change the layer name to Ground and the color to green, as shown earlier.
Select the Transform tool and click outside the canvas to deselect the layer.
Next, let us draw a ball. In the Toolbox, click on the Circle tool.
Under the Layer Type, Create a region layer should be selected.
Click on the top part of the canvas and draw a circle.
In the Layers panel, rename the layer as Ball, as shown earlier.
Change the color to red.
Let us now start animating the ball. Select the Transform tool.
In the Animation panel, click on Turn on animate editing mode icon.
The red rectangle border that appears on the screen, indicates that we are in Animation mode.
Enter 9 on the current frame box. Press Enter.
Next, click on the Keyframes panel.
Here, click on the green plus sign icon to add a new keyframe.
Select the ball on the canvas.
Notice a green dot in the centre of the ball.
Drag this green dot to move the ball to the bottom of the canvas.
Move the ball a little above the ground as demonstrated.
Use shift key to move in a straight path while dragging.
Let’s go to the 11th frame. Once again, add a new keyframe as shown earlier.
Move the ball a little down such as the ball touches the ground.
Notice orange and yellow dots around the ball.  These are known as handles.
Resize the ball as demonstrated, using the orange dots in the handles, to give a squashed effect.
Move the Time cursor to the 13th frame.
Select the 9th frame on the Keyframes panel.
Click on Duplicate icon at the bottom.
Move the Time cursor to the 24th frame.
Select the zeroth frame on the Keyframes panel.
Again, click on the Duplicate icon at the bottom.
Go to the zeroth frame. Click outside the canvas to deselect the ball.
Click on the Play button to see the animation that we created.
Now click on the Pause buton
Lastly, let us save the file.
Go to File and click on Save. I will save in Desktop.
Synfig gives the file a default name as you can see here.
I will change this name to Bouncing-ball.
Observe that the available Synfig file extensions are dot sifz, dot sif, dot sfg.
I will select dot sifz format.
Click on Save. Let us now render the animation.
Go to File and click on Render.
Render settings dialog box opens up.
Give a suitable filename as per your preference with .gif extension.
Click on Choose button to select the location to save.
I will choose Desktop and then click on OK.
Click on Target drop down menu and select Magick++.
Increase the Quality to maximum, i.e. 9, by clicking on the plus sign. This value should never be below 3.
Leave the Image settings as it is.
Click on the Time tab. Here, the frame rate should be 24 fps.
This will give a smooth animation without jerks.
Change the End Time to 24, since our animation ends at the 24th second. Press Enter.
Lastly, click on the Render button at the bottom. It may take a few seconds to render the output.
Now, let me go to the Desktop which is where I saved my .gif file.
We can play the animation using Firefox or any web browser.
Please note you don’t need internet connection to play this animation.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about the interface of Synfig.
We also learnt to: draw basic shapes and fill color,
add keyframes and waypoints,
do a ball animation with squash effect,
Render the output in gif format.
Here is an assignment for you. Create a ball animation in a slanting path.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Models of the hydrogen atom.
In this tutorial we will, Demonstrate Models of the Hydrogen Atom, PhET simulation.
Here I am using-Ubuntu Linux OS v 14.04
Java v 1.7.0
To follow this tutorial, Learner should be familiar with topics in high school science.
Using this simulation we will, Visualize different models of the hydrogen atom.
Explain the experimental predictions of each model.
Discuss limitations of each model.
Explain the energy level diagram.
Determine the orbital shape and orientation from n, l and m values.
Let us start the demonstration.
I have already downloaded Models of the Hydrogen Atom simulation to my Downloads folder.
At the prompt type cd space Downloads and press Enter.
Then type, java space hyphen jar space hydrogen hyphen atom_en.jar and press Enter.
Models of the Hydrogen Atom simulation opens.
Top-left corner of the screen has a menu bar with menu items File and Help.
Below the menu bar, there is a grey button with two options, Experiment and Prediction.
By default Experiment mode opens.
On the screen, we see an experimental setup with a light gun to emit beam of photons.
There is also a Box of Hydrogen.
This box is filled with hydrogen atoms.
The zoom-in box represents a single hydrogen atom.
A message appears.
It prompts you to click on the red button to turn on the light beam.
The light gun has two light controls, White and Monochromatic.
By default White light is selected.
Click on Prediction option on the grey button.
Atomic Model panel opens on the left-side of the screen.
It has a list of Classical and Quantum Atomic Models.
Here we can check how the prediction of a model matches the experimental results.
Legend box on the right-side of the screen has a list of sub-atomic particles.
At the bottom of the screen we have, Slider to control speed of animation Play/Pause and Step buttons.
The first model of atom proposed, is the Billiard Ball model.
By default Billiard Ball is selected from the list.
Billiard Ball Model
Billiard Ball model is also called as Dalton's atomic model.
It was proposed by John Dalton.
According to this model, individual atom is visualized as solid, hard spheres, like billiard balls.
Click on the red button of the light gun.
Select White light.
A beam of photons having different wave lengths pass through box of hydrogen.
Observe that, All photons in the path of hydrogen atoms are deflected.
Limitations of Billiard Ball model.
Here are the limitations of Billiard Ball model.
Back to the simulation.
Turn off the light beam.
Click on Plum Pudding from the Atomic Model list.
This model was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898.
The positive charge is uniformly distributed and electrons are embedded into it.
The brown mass is the positive charge.
Blue color particle in the middle is the electron.
Click on Show spectrometer check-box.
Turn on the light beam.
Select White light.
When photons strikes electron, the electron moves and photons deflected.
Notice that, spectrum consists of only emitted uv photons.
Turn off the light beam.
Limitations of Plum Pudding model
Here are the limitations of Plum Pudding model.
Based on the above observations, Rutherford proposed the Classical solar system model of atom.
Solar System Model Rutherford nuclear model of an atom is like a small scale solar system.
Nucleus plays the role of sun and the electrons that of revolving planets.
The very small positive charge portion of the atom was called nucleus.
Electrons move around the nucleus.
They move with very high speed in circular paths called orbits.
Back to the simulation.
Pause the simulation.
Click on Classical Solar System from the list.
Screen has Show electron energy level diagram check-box at the top-right corner.
Click on the check box.
It shows the energy of the electron.
If this model were true, it should take an electron only a fraction of a second to spiral into the nucleus.
Turn on the light beam.
Drag the speed slider to slow.
Click on Step button to view the energy of the electron.
Energy of the electron goes from highest to lowest in a fraction of a second.
We know that this does not happen.
Atom is known to be stable.
Turn off the light beam.
Limitations of Solar System model Rutherford model cannot explain, The stability of an atom and also, The distribution of electrons and their energies.
Back to the simulation.
From the Atomic Model list, click on Bohr.
Neils Bohr proposed a model of hydrogen atom to improve upon Rutherford's model.
According to this model, The electron moves around the nucleus in an orbit of fixed radius and energy.
The energy of an electron in the orbit does not change with time.
These orbits are called energy levels.
These orbits are represented by n=1,2,3,4 etc in the Electron energy level diagram.
Turn on the light beam.
Click on Play button.
Initially there is an electron in the 1st orbit of an atom.
Electron energy level diagram shows electron at n =1
Observe the electronic transition in Electron energy level diagram.
Electron absorbs photon and gets excited to higher level.
Energy is emitted when electron moves from higher level to lower level.
This electron returns back to 1
Observe the spectrometer.
Spectrometer shows emitted photons.
Under Light controls, click on Monochromatic radio button.
Then check Show absorption wavelengths checkbox.
You will see four vertical spectral lines.
These lines represent the wavelengths of absorption.
The slider is highlighted on the first line.
Wavelength, 94 nm as shown in the text box.
As the photon strikes the electron, observe the electronic transition at 94 nm in Electron energy level diagram.
The electron moves to n= 6
After a while it moves to lower level by emitting photon.
Turn off the light beam.
As an assignment, Select Bohr Atomic model.
Change the light beam to Monochromatic.
Observe the electronic transitions at 103 nm, 112 nm, and 122 nm absorption wave lengths.
Observe the energy level diagram and the spectrometer results.
Note the observation and give an explanation.
Limitations of Bohr’s model
Bohr's model was unable to explain the following phenomena.
Back to the simulation.
Another model based on dual behavior of electrons was proposed.
Click on de Broglie from the Atomic Model list.
Notice the wave which represents electron in zoom-in box.
deBroglie Atomic Model: The French physicist, de Broglie in 1924 proposed dual behavior of electrons.
Like radiation, matter should also exhibit both particle and wavelike properties.
Electrons should also have momentum as well as wavelength.
Turn on the light beam.
Notice that the electron absorbs photon and moves to higher energy level orbit.
Electron at higher energy level emits energy.
It returns to the lower energy level orbit.
Observe the electronic transitions in energy level diagram.
Top-left corner of the view box has radial view drop-down box.
Click on drop-down arrow.
Scroll to 3D view and click on it.
Now observe the wave nature of electron in 3D view.
Turn off the light beam.
In order to explain the spectrum of hydrogen atom, theory of quantum mechanics came into existence.
Schrödinger Model : Erwin Schrödinger proposed the quantum mechanical model of the atom.
Schrödinger used mathematical equations to describe the probability of finding an electron.
Quantum Numbers: The three coordinates that come from Schrodinger's wave equations are quantum numbers, Principal (n), Angular (l), and Magnetic (m).
Quantum numbers describe size, shape and orientation of the orbitals.
Back to simulation.
Click on Schrödinger from the list.
In the zoom in box, atom is shown with nucleus surrounded by electron cloud.
Switch back to White light.
Turn on the light beam.
Observe that electron absorbs photon and moves to different orbital.
Observe the shapes of orbitals as the electron moves.
Notice the electronic transitions in Electron energy level diagram.
In addition to value of n, energy level diagram has values for l and m also.
Note n,  l, m values at the bottom right corner of the view box.
Note the change in n, l, m values as the photons strike the electrons.
All these models compare how the experimental results match with the prediction.
As an assignment, For the Schrodinger's atomic model, select Monochromatic light beam.
Note n,l,m values for the electron at four absorption wavelengths.
Note the orbital shape and possible orientation for each wavelength.
In this tutorial we have demonstrated, How to use Models of the Hydrogen Atom,  PhET simulation.
Using this simulation we have, Visualized different models of the hydrogen atom.
Explained the experimental predictions of each model.
Discussed limitations of each model.
Determined the orbital shape and orientation from n, l and m values.
Explained the energy level diagram.

Once again, save the changes and observe the changes on the Homepage.
Understand what has happened.
Before exploring further, let us learn a few more details regarding an article.
Switch to homepage and refresh it.
All the articles are listed here, along with their details in the header.
What exactly has been shown?
Observe that the Title of an article is clickable.
Let me click on Vitamin A.
Now the article Vitamin A has opened on a full page.
At the bottom, there is a link to the Next article.
Category of this article says it is Uncategorised and this is also a hyperlink.
I will click on Uncategorised.
And now, we are re-directed to a page with all the articles belonging to the category Uncategorised.
Here are our articles and they are both Uncategorised, by default.
Let us now see how we can remove this header information from all the articles.
Come back to the Article Manager page.
Here click on the Options button in the toolbar, towards the extreme right.
It will open another page with the title “Article Manager Options”.
On the top left, are the options to Save, Save & Close and Cancel the changes made on this window.
These settings are global options and apply to all articles, unless changed specifically.
Show Title shows the Title of the article.
By default, it is set to Show.
Let's set it to Hide and click on Save.
Go to the Digital India web page and refresh the page.
Notice that the Title is no longer visible.
Go back to the Article Manager page.
Set Show Title to Show.
Next, let’s set Linked Titles as No.
This will remove the Title hyperlink.
We will skip Show Intro text  option for now.
Show Category and Link Category. Show the category in the header and also makes it a hyperlink.
Let's choose No option for Linked Category, Hide option for Show Category.
Save these changes.
Go to the Digital India webpage and refresh the page.
Observe that the category information is no longer visible. And, the Title is no longer a hyperlink.
Go back to the article manager page.
Explore all the other options in the settings on your own and note what happens.
Now scroll down to see the last section of the settings window.
These options enable us to show or hide the print and email icons.
Let’s go to the Digital India web page.
On the extreme right side of the article, notice a button with a small wheel and down arrow.
Click on this button.
We can see 2 options: Print, Email.
Click on the print icon.
This will open a new window with only the article and print button on the right.
Clicking on the print button will open the default print dialog box.
The further procedure is the same, as for any print job.
Let's cancel the printing now.
We will learn about the email option in another tutorial later.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Typing text and basic formatting.
Align text
Use Bullets and Numbering
Use Cut, Copy and Paste options
Use Bold, Underline and Italic options
Use the Font name, Font size, Font color options in Writer
Formatting features: Applying these features make our documents more attractive.
They will be much easier to read as compared to the documents which are plain text.
Ubuntu Linux OS version 18.04 and  LibreOffice Suite version 6.3.5
This file has been provided to you in the Code files link on this tutorial page.
Please download and extract the file.
Make a copy and then use it for practising.
We will first learn about aligning text in Writer.
We had previously typed the word RESUME and aligned it to the center of the page.
So, let’s select the word RESUME once again.
If you have resized your LibreOffice window, some of the icon may not be visible.
In that case, click on the double arrow icon at the end of the toolbars to see the hidden icons.
Now click on the Align Left icon on the Formatting toolbar.
The word RESUME is now aligned to the left of the page.
Click on the Align Right icon.
Now, click on the Justify icon.
The word RESUME is uniformly placed between the right and left margin of the page.
This feature will be more obvious when we have a line or paragraph of text.
Let’s undo the changes until our text Resume is centre-aligned.
In Writer, we press Ctrl + Z keys on the keyboard to undo an action.
Now, press Enter key on the keyboard to go to the next line.
Press the Enter key once again to create one more line.
Click on the Align Left icon in the toolbar.
Then click on the Bold icon from the toolbar to disable the bold option.
Now let’s learn about bullets and numbering.
Bullets and Numbering are used when independent points have to be written in a document
Each point starts with either a bullet or a number.
Bullets are used for unordered lists
Numbering is used for ordered lists
In the Formatting toolbar, we can see the separate icons for Bullets and Numbering.
Let’s click on the Bullets icon.
Immediately a dot or bullet symbol appears on the document.
Let’s type the alphabet a and press Enter.
Now, let’s type b and press Enter.
Next let’s press the Numbering icon.
Immediately, the bullet symbol is converted to number 1.
Type c and press Enter.
Type d and press Enter.
Hope this gives you a clear picture of the difference between bullets and numbering.
Click and drag the left mouse button to select all this text.
Now, we will learn another method of accessing Bullets and Numbering.
First click on the Format menu in the menu bar and then on Bullets and Numbering option.
Bullets and Numbering dialog box opens up.
It provides various styles under different tabs which can be applied to our document.
Select Bullets tab if not already selected.
Many bullets styles are seen here.
Select the large square bullets.
And click on the OK button at the bottom right corner of the dialog box.
Observe the change in the bullet symbols.
Now, let’s reopen the Bullets and Numbering dialog box and click on the Numbering tab.
Many numbering styles are seen here.
Let’s select the Roman numerals style.
And click on the OK button at the bottom right corner of the dialog box.
Observe the change in the numbering. They appear as Roman numerals now.
Likewise we can use any bullets or numbering style as per our choice.
Now press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Then press the Backspace key on the keyboard to remove the remaining numbering also.
Let’s reopen the Bullets and Numbering dialog box and click on the Numbering tab.
Now, let us click on the second style
We are now ready to type our first point.
We’ll type NAME colon space RAMESH and press Enter.
Here onwards, press the Enter key after every point.
The next bullet point shows the new incremental number.
Let’s type the second point in the Resume as “FATHER’S NAME” colon MAHESH
Then type the third point as MOTHER’S NAME colon SHWETA.
Type the next two points as shown here.
Let’s save our file by pressing Ctrl + S keys.
It’s a good habit to frequently save our file while working.
There can be multiple levels of bullets or numbers in a list.
It depends on the format we choose.
Let me demonstrate for you.
Go to point no. 4 FATHERS OCCUPATION.
Place the cursor after the colon and press Enter.
Now press Tab key once.
Immediately, no. 5 turns into a new Bullet list and gets indented below no. 4
Move the cursor to the end of the bullet point and press Enter.
Type SELF EMPLOYED and press Enter.
We can press Shift + Tab keys to decrease the indentation.
Now press the Delete key till the next point comes up one line.
Move the cursor to the end of the numbered point 5 and press Enter.
To turn off Bullets and Numbering, reopen the Bullets and Numbering dialog box.
Click on the Remove button at the bottom.
We see that the bullet and numbering style is no longer seen for the new line of text.
Explore the bullets and numbering quick access icon in the formatting toolbar on your own.
Notice that we have typed the word NAME thrice in our document.
First, delete the word NAME from the text MOTHER’S NAME.
Select the word NAME in FATHER’S NAME
Right-click on the mouse and select Copy.
Place the cursor between the text MOTHER’S and colon symbol.
Right-click on the mouse and select Paste.
We see that the word NAME gets pasted automatically.
The shortcut keys for these options are Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste.
This feature is very useful while writing repeated text in large documents.
So we don't need to type the entire text repeatedly. We can simply copy and paste.
In Writer, there is a feature similar to Copy, which is Cut.
Let me show a demonstration.
First, delete the word NAME from the text MOTHER’S NAME.
Now select the word NAME in FATHER'S NAME.
Right-click and select Cut.
Notice that the word NAME is no longer there next to the word FATHER’S.
Which means it has been cut or deleted.
Place the cursor between the text MOTHER’S and colon symbol.
Right-click on the mouse and select Paste.
We see that the word NAME is now pasted next to the word MOTHER’S
The shortcut key to cut is Ctrl+X.
Likewise, paste the word after FATHER’S also.
Cut and Paste feature is useful to move a text from one place in the document to another.
The only difference between copying and cutting the text is  the Copy option keeps the original word at its place from where it was copied  whereas the Cut option removes it from its original place.
Move the cursor to the end of the document.
Now let’s type a new heading EDUCATION DETAILS.
We will now learn how the Font name and Font size of any text can be changed or applied.
Previously, we had selected UnDotum as the font name.
Hence we can see UnDotum in the Font name field.
Let us use a different Font and Size for the heading EDUCATION DETAILS.
So, first select the text EDUCATION DETAILS
Search for Liberation Sans and click on it.
The Font Size field shows 14 currently.
Let’s change this to 11.
We see that the Font size of the text decreases.
Let’s now move to Font Color.
Make sure that our text is still selected.
Now, click on the dropdown in the Font Color and select the color green.
So, we see that the heading is now green in color.
Next we will click on the icons Bold, Italic and Underline.
We can use any combination of these text formats for our text, as per our requirements.
Save our file by pressing Ctrl + S keys.
In this tutorial we learnt to:
Align text
Use Bullets and Numbering
Use Bold, Underline and Italic options
Use the Font name, Font size, Font color options in Writer
Activate Bullets and Numbering
Choose any style and type few lines of text
Select some text and change its Font  name to Free Sans
Set the Font size to 16
Make the text Italic
Change the Font color to red
Save and close the file

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Pointers in C and C++ .
In this tutorial we will learn:
Pointers
To create Pointers
And operations on Pointers.
We will do this with the help of an example.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10,
gcc and g++ compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
Let us start with an introduction to pointers.
Pointers point to the locations in memory.
Pointers store the memory address.
It also gives value stored at that address.
Now, let us see an example on pointers.
Note that our file name is pointers_demo.c.
Let us go through the code now.
Here we have long integer num, assigned value 10.
Then we have declared a pointer ptr.
Asterisk sign is used to declare a pointer.
This pointer can point to type long  int.
In the 'printf' statement, ampersand is used for retrieving memory address of the variable.
So, ampersand num (&num) will give the memory address of num.
This statement will print the address of the variable num.
Over here, ptr stores the address of num.
This statement will print the address of ptr.
sizeof() function will give the size of ptr.
This is will give the value of ptr.
That is the memory address of num.
And here asterisk ptr will give the value at the address.
So, using asterisk will not give the memory address.
Instead it will give the value.
%ld is a format specifier for the long int.
To compile, type gcc space  pointers underscore demo dot c space hyphen o space point
Type dot slash point. Press Enter.
We see that the num address and ptr value is same
where as memory address of num and ptr are different.
Then the size of pointer is 8 bytes.
Also the value pointed by ptr is 10 which was assigned to num.
Now let us see the same program in  C++.
Note that our file name is pointer underscore demo.cpp.
Here we have a few changes like the header file as iostream.
Then we are using the std namespace.
And here we have the cout function in place of printf() function.
Rest all the things are similar.
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
To compile, type g++ space pointers_demo.cpp space hyphen o space point1, press Enter.
Type dot slash point1, press Enter.
We can see that the output is similar to our C program.
Come back to our slide.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt:
About the pointer.
To create a pointer.
And operation on pointer.
As an assignment, write a C and C++ program
to declare a variable and pointer.
Store the address of variable in the pointer.
And print the value of the pointer.
In this tutorial, we will cover Simple Forms in LibreOffice Base.
Here, we will learn the following:
What is a form?
How to create a form using the Wizard
Using LibreOffice Base, so far, we learnt about creating a database and creating tables where we store the data.
But, how do we enter data into the database tables?
One way is to directly type in data into the cells of the tables which we did in the last tutorial.
There is another way to enter data swiftly as well as with minimum errors.
And that is by using Forms. A form is a front-end or user interface for data entry and editing data.
For example, a simple form can consist of fields in a table.
Let us consider the "Library" database example that we created in the previous tutorials.
So, a simple form can consist of the fields in the Books table.
And this form, now, can be used to enter data into the Books table.
Now, let us learn how to create a form.
Let us first invoke the LibreOffice Base program.
If Base program is not opened, then we will click on the Start button at the bottom left and then click on All programs. Then click on LibreOffice Suite and then click on LibreOffice Base.
Let us now click on the 'open an existing database file' option.
In the 'Recently Used' drop-down box, our 'Library' database should be visible.
So now, let us select it and click on the Finish button.
If LibreOffice Base is already open
then we can open the 'Library' database file 'Library.odb' by clicking on the File menu on the top and then clicking on Open.
Alternately, click on Recent Documents in the File menu and choose 'Library.odb'.
Now, we are in the 'Library' Database.
Notice that there are two ways to create a new form: "Create Form in Design View" and "Use Wizard to create form".
Let us click on the second option: Use Wizard to create form.
We now see a new window which is similar to the 'LibreOffice Writer' window.
And on top of it, we see a pop-up window that says 'Form Wizard'.
Let’s go through this Wizard to create our first form based on the Books table.
Notice the 8 steps that we will go through on the left hand side.
We are in step 1 which is 'Field Selection'.
And, on the right hand side let us choose Table:Books from the drop-down here that says Tables or queries.
Below this, we see a list of Available fields on the left hand side.
On the right hand side we see Fields on the form.
We will need to move only those fields which we need on the form.
For now, let us click on the button with double-arrow mark symbols.
Notice that we have moved all the fields from the left to the right.
Since we have set up 'BookId' field to auto-generate its own numbers, we don’t need it on the form.
So, let us move this field back to the left hand side.
Click on BookId on the right hand side and click on the button that has one 'Less than' symbol.
OK, let us go to the next step now by clicking on the Next button at the bottom.
Step 2. Since we are creating a simple form, let us skip this step for now and simply click on the Next button.
We are in Step 5. 'Arrange controls'.
Also notice that in the background window, we see the Books table in an orange background.
Let us click on the four icons below the label that says 'Arrangement of the main form'.
As we click through, we see the background window changing, in the arrangement of labels and text boxes saying title, author etc.
Let us use the first arrangement that says 'Columnar – Labels Left'  and click on the first icon.
Here the labels are to the left and the text boxes on the right, just like a typical paper form.
Now, let us click on the Next button to proceed.
We are on Step 6 that says 'Set Data Entry'.
We will skip this step for now, and go to the next step.
Step 7. 'Apply Styles'.
Notice that the window background colour changes as we click through each colour in the list box.
Let us choose Ice Blue by clicking on it.
Now, let us go to the final step.
Step 8. Let us now give a name to our form.
We can follow our own naming conventions.
But for now, let us type a descriptive name, 'Books Data Entry Form' in the text box that is below the label ‘Name of the form’.
Now, how do we want to proceed after creating the form?
Let us 'Work with the form' first.
Meaning- we will start using the form for data entry.
To change the form design, we can choose 'Modify the form' which we will see later.
For now, we are done. So, let us click on the Finish button at the bottom.
We have now created our first simple form that says 'Books Data Entry Form' on the window title.
Notice that the text boxes are filled with values that read 'An autobiography', 'Jawaharlal Nehru' etc.
Where did these values come from?
We typed-in these values directly into the Books table in the previous part of the Base tutorial.
Now this form is ready to use for data entry.
Let us click on the tab keys to go through each value.
Notice that the form shows the second book's information and the title is now 'Conquest of self'.
We can also go to each book's information, otherwise called 'record', by clicking on the black triangle icon that points to the right, in the Forms Navigation toolbar at the bottom.
Notice that the record number 3 of 5 is displayed here.
Notice that Base shows tool tips when we point our cursor on these black arrow icons:
First Record, Previous Record, Next Record and Last Record.
We also can use these to traverse through the records.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Simple Forms in LibreOffice Base.
To summarize, we learned: What a form is? How to create a form using the Wizard.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Linear Motion.
In this tutorial we will, Verify Newton's first law of motion using constant acceleration simulation.
Calculate position and velocity of a car using equations of motion.
Verify Newton's second law of motion using air track glider simulation.
Here I am using,  Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04.
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
For the pre-requisites tutorials please visit this site.
Use the given link to download the  App.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
Double-click on html5phen folder. Double-click on the phen folder.
To open Motion with Constant Acceleration, press Ctrl + F keys simultaneously.
In the search bar type acceleration.
Right click on acceleration_en.htm file.
Select the option Open With Firefox web Browser.
Motion with constant Acceleration App opens in the browser.
Interface has two panels.
Green control panel contains text fields.
Here we can edit  Initial position  , Initial velocity and  Acceleration.
At the bottom of the green panel there are two radio buttons.
Show velocity vector and  Show acceleration vector.
On the yellow panel we have three digital clocks.
Here we can see a green and red coloured barriers.
Click on Start button.
Click the Slow motion check-box.
Observe that a car starts to move with a constant acceleration.
The default value for Acceleration is
When the car crosses the green barrier with its front bumper, green digital clock stops.
Similarly when the car crosses the red barrier, the red digital clock stops.
Notice that car has moved out of the screen, but it is still in motion.
This is indicated by grey digital clock.
This clock shows the instantaneous time of the moving car.
Observe that, the values of x and v are changing continuously.
It means that the car is in uniform motion.
And it will continue to be in motion until an external force is applied.
Click on the Pause button and uncheck the Slow motion check-box.
Let’s assume that by clicking Pause button we have applied an external force on the car.
Notice that the grey digital clock has stopped.
It means that car has stopped moving.
Click on the Reset button.
Let's change the Initial position to 5 meter  and press Enter.
Change the Initial velocity to 5 m/s (meter per second) and press Enter.
And value of Acceleration to 2 m/s
Observe the Position v/s time and Velocity v/s time graphs.
The red point in the Position v/s time graph has shifted from 0 meter to 5 meter.
The pink point in the Velocity v/s time graph has shifted from 0 m/s to 5 m/s.
Notice the shift in blue point in Acceleration v/s time graph.
Click on the Start button.
And then click on the Pause button when car touches the red barrier.
Observe that the pink colored vector shows the direction of velocity.
Now let us study the variations in each graph.
Observe the Acceleration v/s time graph.
It shows a straight line parallel to the time axis.
As time changes acceleration remains constant.
Observe the Velocity v/s time graph.
Look at the Position v/s time graph.
This graph is exponentially increasing, due to the change in position and velocity of the car.
Let us verify the values of position and velocity using equations of motion.
Here are the Equations of motion.
We will note the measured and calculated values in the table.
Next we will use both green and red barrier to measure position and velocity.
Click and drag the green barrier to 15 meter.
Similarly drag the red barrier to 40 meter.
Click on the Start button and then Pause when it touches the green barrier.
Note that the App has measured the values of position and velocity.
Let us calculate velocity using the first equation of motion.
Substitute the values of acceleration, time and initial velocity shown in the App in the equation.
8.06 m/s is the calculated value of the velocity.
Let us calculate the position using the second equation of motion.
Similarly substitute the values shown in the App.
14.99 meter is the calculated value of the position.
Observe that the values of position and velocity are approximately equal to the measured values.
Note the calculated and measured values in the table.
As an assignment
Calculate the values using Equations of motion.
Complete the table and compare your answers with the ones shown in the App.
Now we will explore the next App.
To open Newton's Second Law Experiment App, Right click on the newtonlaw2_en.htm file and Open With Firefox Web Browser.
Using this App we will verify the Newton's second law.
The App opens with air track glider setup.
The screen shows a wagon on the air track.
Here digital clock is used to record the time when wagon crosses the LB.
The graph records position v/s time data.
In the green control panel we can vary
The default Mass of the wagon is 100 g.
Scroll down the screen.
Here we have the formula used in this experiment.
By default, motion with constant acceleration is used in the App.
Click on the Start button.
This button is a toggle for Start and Record data.
Observe that the hanging mass pulls the wagon downwards.
Default value of the Hanging mass is 1 gram, it takes values from 1 gram to 100 grams.
Here digital clock notes the time when the wagon crosses the LB.
The distance from the start to LB is shown as 0.5 meter.
The App has  calculated the acceleration using the formula 2s/t
The calculated value of acceleration is 0.097 m/s
Click on the Reset button.
Click and drag the LB to the left on second black rectangle.
Click on the Start button.
Notice that here also the value of acceleration is 0.097 m/s
Click on the Record data button.
Observe that the Diagram button is inactive.
It becomes active when at least four values are recorded in the Data box.
Again click and drag the LB to second green rectangle.
Click on the Start button and then click on Record data button.
Similarly take four more readings for distance and time and record in the Data box.
In the Data box, readings of six different distances have been recorded.
Observe the plotted points for position and time in the graph.
Diagram button is now active.
An exponential graph appears on the screen.
Notice that, acceleration remains same for all the distances.
It means that change in distance does not change the acceleration.
According to Newton's second law the acceleration depends on the mass of the wagon.
Click on the Reset button.
Now change the Mass of the wagon to 300 g.
Click on Start button.
Notice the change in the acceleration.
The value of acceleration has changed to 0.033 m/s
Click on the Reset button.
Now let us change the value of Hanging mass to 4 g.
Click on Start button.
Notice the change in the acceleration. The value of acceleration has changed to 0.129 m/s
Recall that acceleration depends on mass of the wagon and the hanging mass.
Let us make a tabular column to note the values.
As an assignment
For each value of mass of the wagon change the value of the Hanging mass.
Observe the difference in the acceleration.
Let us summarize
Using these Apps we have,
Calculated position and velocity of a car using equations of motion.
Verified Newton's second law of motion using air track glider simulation.
These Apps were created by Walter-fendt and his team.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Select statement.
Select with WHERE clause,
Select with relational operators,
Select with logical operators,
Alias for column names.
PostgreSQL 9.3.x
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of database and tables.
For more details, refer to the RDBMS PostgreSQL series on this website.
Let us open pgAdmin.
Right-click on the students table and select View Data and then View All Rows.
We can see the students table with the 4 records that we inserted earlier.
I'll show how to insert records in the  Edit Data window.
Click on the save icon on the top left of the toolbar to save the changes.
We can insert records either in this Edit data window or through the Insert statement.
I’ll insert some more records for demonstration purpose.
Note that I have entered ‘NULL’ value in the date of birth column for student id ‘s012’.
In PostgreSQL, the term NULL is used to represent a missing value or an unknown value.
A field with a NULL value represents no value.
Execute the query.
So far, we have inserted 14 records.
A NULL value field appears to be blank.
Null is not the same as a zero value or space value.
It implies that a database field value has not been stored.
Next, we will see about how to use SELECT statement with many clauses.
The SELECT statement retrieves data from a database.
The data is returned in rows and columns format i.e. in a tabular format.
It has many clauses that we can combine to form a powerful query.
The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is:
Now let us learn to write queries using Select statements.
Switch back to the PgAdmin main screen.
Right-click on students node and select Scripts and then click on SELECT script.
This is a simple Select statement which retrieves data from the students table.
You can specify the column names as shown here or use 'asterisk' to select all the columns.
I want the details of certain columns only.
The SQL statement will display -  the student id, student name, city and cgpa columns
Now, let’s execute the query to see the output.
The expected rows and columns are displayed.
SELECT with WHERE clause is used  to filter the rows which match the criteria that is specified and  to limit the number of rows.
The syntax of this statement is, SELECT column-names FROM table-name WHERE condition.
Records that satisfy the specified condition will be displayed on executing this statement.
Let’s switch back to the pgAdmin SQL Editor.
Type: SELECT studentid, studentname, city, cgpa from students where city ='Mumbai'.
Now, execute this query.
It will retrieve the rows from the students table and display students from Mumbai city.
Here the City is the column name and 'Mumbai' is the value to filter.
Now, let’s change the city value to 'Bangalore' and execute the query.
This is because the condition returns false on execution
which means there are no records that match with the given condition.
Next, we will see how to use comparison or relational operators in the WHERE clause.
Relational operators listed here, can also be used within the WHERE clause.
Switch back to the pgAdmin SQL Editor.
Type: Select studentid, studentname, city, cgpa from students where cgpa > 8.5
Execute the query.
The output shows details of students who have cgpa greater than 8.5
Let us type another query to retrieve the student details who are not from Mumbai city.
Note the 'Not equal to' operator.
It is symbolized by an open and close angular bracket.
Likewise, we can use relational operators to filter data depending upon our requirement.
Next let’s learn how to use arithmetic operators in the Select statement.
When we need to do calculations within SQL statements, we can use arithmetic expressions.
Arithmetic expressions contain column names, arithmetic operators and numeric values.
Arithmetic operators will however not work for character data type columns.
Let’s do a simple arithmetic calculation using some operators.
Type: Select 2+15+98+45;
Type: Select 230 divided by 5;
Let us see how to use arithmetic operators with a column of the table.
We have a column called cgpa  with numeric data type.
Let us calculate the percentage from cgpa score.
Type the query as shown here.
Here, we are using the multiplication operator asterisk, to calculate the percentage.
Let’s execute the query now.
Percentage is calculated and displayed in a new column, as shown here.
This percentage data is not stored in the database. It only displays the calculation.
Now I want to give a name to this column so that it is more meaningful.
An alias is used to rename a column temporarily.
It appears as a heading in the output of the query.
Use column alias if the original column name is not meaningful or
Here, add the text as Percentage after the calculation column.
We can also specify in capital letters as “PERCENTAGE” within double quotes.
Please note, column names which are mixed-case or uppercase have to be within double quotes in postgresql.
Execute the query.
We can see the column name has changed to PERCENTAGE in capital letters.
Next we will see how to use logical operators within the Select statement.
Logical operators are used where more than one condition needs to be checked.
Or, using logical operators, we can combine two or more conditions.
The most commonly used logical operators are:
OR: This joins two or more conditions and returns results when at least one of the conditions is true.
NOT: This operator results in the reverse of a condition.
Switch back to PgAdmin interface.
It will return the output when both the conditions are true.
Execute the query to see the output.
Next, let’s change the 'AND' to 'OR' logical operator and see the output.
The records are retrieved if either one of the conditions is true.
That is either the student is from Pune city or gender is ‘Female’
This query will display students who are not from Mumbai or Chennai.
Here we have used the NOT and AND operators together.
Execute the query and see the output.
In this tutorial, we have learnt about
Select with WHERE clause,
Select with logical operators and
As an assignment, write a Select statement to  display all columns from students table for the student name 'Ram'.
Display studentid, studentname, dob of students whose cgpa is greater than 8 and less than 9.5

Here is a tip for displaying HTML inside your php. This is specially useful when you are using ‘if’ statements or anything that uses a block and when you need to do this on a condition or you need to output a lot of HTML inside something that is working on php.
So, form action equals 'Index.php'
So now we have a chunk of php code here and a chunk here.  And the rest here is not interpreted as php.  Since it is HTML it will be displayed as HTML code.
Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Subclassing and Method overriding.
In this tutorial, we will learn about:  subclassing , extends keyword and  method overriding.
Here we are using:  Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 , JDK 1.7 , Eclipse 4.3.1
First of all, we will learn what subclassing is.
It is a way to create a new class from an existing class.
The new class created is  subclass or derived class or child class.
The already existing class is called superclass or base class or parent class.
Now, let me show you how to create a subclass. I have already created a project named MyProject.
I have created a class  in it named Employee.
It has variables, name and email_address.
It also has the setter and getter methods for the class.
It has a method "getDetails()". This method returns  "name" and "email_address".
Now, let us come to the Manager class.
It has variables- name, email_address and department.
We can see that some variables are common to both Employee and Manager class.
name and email_address are present in the Employee class. We can see that it is also there in Manager class.
Thus, Manager class can be made a subclass of Employee class.
For that, we have to make some changes in the Manager class.
After public class Manager, type: extends Employee.
We use the extends keyword to create a subclass from an existing class.
Remove the duplicate variables common to both the classes.
So, remove name and email_address from Manager class.
Also remove setter and getter methods of the same.
In the class 'Manager', we will have only one variable department.
We also have the setter and getter method for department.
In this way, the 'Manager' class inherits the members of 'Employee' class.
This way of extending one class from another is called single inheritance.
I have also created another class named 'TestEmployee'.
Inside the main method, we will create the object of  Manager class.
So, inside the main method, type: Manager manager equal to new Manager parentheses.
Next, we will call the setter methods of the Manager class.
So, type, manager dot setName within brackets and double quotes Nikkita Dinesh
Then type: manager dot setEmail within brackets and double quotes abc at gmail dot com.
Then type, manager dot setDepartment within brackets and double quotes Accounts.
You can use any name, email address and department.
Now, let us call the getDetails() method using the Manager object.
So, type: System.out.println within brackets manager dot getDetails.
Now, let us save and run the program.
We can see that we get the output as: Name: Nikkita Dinesh ,Email: abc@gmail.com
Here, the object of the 'Manager' class calls the getDetails() method.
Now, come to the Manager class.
We can see that there is no getDetails() method here.
But, we still got the output. This is because, the Manager class extends the Employee class.
The Manager class automatically inherits the variables and methods of  Employee class.
So, it checks in the parent class which is Employee.
Let us come to the Employee class. It finds the getDetails() method here.
Note that we have not returned the department. As a result, it did not print the department in the output.
Now, let us change the getDetails method  to private. Save the file.
We can see that we get a compilation error in the TestEmployee class.
It says "The method getDetails() from the type Employee is not visible".
This means that getDetails() method cannot be accessed.
This is because we have declared getDetails() method as 'private'.
A subclass does not inherit the private members of its superclass.
Subclass cannot directly access the private members of the superclass.
The superclass can have public or protected methods.
These methods can access their private fields.
The subclass can also access the private fields through these methods.
So, let us change it back to public.
Now, let us include the method getDetails in the Manager class.
This method will return name, email_address and department.
So, type: public String getDetails parentheses.
Inside the method, type: return within brackets Name plus getName() plus slash n plus Email plus getEmail() plus slash n plus Manager of plus getDepartment() semicolon.  Save the file.
Note that now, we have the method getDetails in both 'Manager' and 'Employee' class.
The name, return type and argument list of the method is same in both the classes.
A method in the subclass is said to override the method in the parent class if:
Come back to the Manager class.
Before the getDetails() method, type: @Override.
This is an override annotation. It indicates that a method is intended to override a method in superclass.
Now, let us see what annotation is.
Annotations:  start with at (@) sign character , provide data about a program , have no direct effect on the operation of the code.
If a method is annotated with @Override, compiler generates error if:  the method does override a method declared in a superclass.
The method signature is different in its superclass.
Now, let us come back to the IDE. Come back to the Manager class.
The at (@) sign character indicates the compiler that what follows is an annotation.
Here, it shows that the getDetails() method is overridden.
Let us come to the TestEmployee class.
Save the file and run the program.
We get the output as follows: Name: Nikkita Dinesh ,Email: abc@gmail.com ,Manager of Accounts .
Here, the object of the Manager class calls the getDetails() method.
But this time, it calls the method of Manager class itself.
In this way, we override the method of the parent class by the subclass.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:Subclassing and Method Overriding.
As an assignment, create a class Vehicle which has a method run that prints “The Vehicle is running.”
Also create a class Bike which has a method run that prints “The Bike is running safely.”
The output should be “The Bike is running safely.”

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Electronic components and connections.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the: Breadboard and its internal connections,
LED on the breadboard,  PushButton and
To follow this series, you should have basic knowledge of:
open circuit,
serial and parallel connections,
batteries,  positive and negative voltage.
This tutorial is recorded using the following components:  Breadboard,
LED or Tri Colour LED,  Push Button,
Resistor  and  Seven Segment Display.
This is what the breadboard looks like.
A breadboard is a device for holding the components of a circuit and connecting them together.
We can build an electronic circuit on a breadboard without doing any soldering.
The top two rails and bottom two rails are called power rails.
The top row of holes are all connected together and are marked here with red dots and blue dots.
Note that the connection breaks in the middle of the breadboard.
In the middle, the columns of wires are connected together.
For example, all the green holes marked are connected together.
Next we will learn about LED.
It emits a colored light when there is a current flowing through it.
An LED has two leads, namely anode and cathode.
The longer lead is the anode. It should be connected to the positive voltage.
The shorter lead is the cathode. It should be connected to the ground.
Tri-color LED is an advanced version of LED which emits three different colours.
It has 4 pins. The longest lead is called the common lead.
The remaining three pins are for the red, green and blue colour LEDs.
There are two types of tri-color LEDs: common anode and common cathode.
In common anode version, the common lead should be connected to the positive voltage.
In common cathode version, the common lead should be connected to the ground.
Next, we will learn about Resistor.
A resistor is used to limit the current flowing in the circuit.
Now, let’s build a simple circuit using an LED, a resistor and a breadboard.
The image shows the proper connections.
Positive of the 9 volt battery is connected to the second rail.
Negative of the 9 volt battery is connected to the 1st rail.
Anode (i.e Right lead) of the LED, is connected to the 2nd rail of the breadboard through a resistor.
Cathode (i.e Left lead) of the LED, is connected to the 1st rail of the breadboard.
This is the live setup of the LED connections.
You can see that the LED is glowing, because the connections we used are proper.
Now, we’ll see the common mistakes people make when using breadboard to make connections.
In this connection, the LED doesn’t glow because the connections are not proper.
The resistor and LED are placed beside each other.
The holes in the breadboard except the power rails are connected column-wise.
So, there’s no connection between the anode of the LED and the resistor lead.
In the next connection, the cathode of the LED is connected to the 2nd rail.
The anode of the LED is connected to the 1st rail through the resistor.
The connections in this circuit are the reverse of what it should be.
Next, we will learn about the push button.
A push button is a simple switch mechanism that connects two points in a circuit when pressed.
Push button usually comes with four legs.
Irrespective of the position of the switch, legs A and C are always connected.
Similarly, legs B and D are always connected.
When the switch is pressed all the four legs are connected to each other.
Now, let us add a push button to the previous circuit and use it to change the state of the LED.
The image shows the proper connections.
Let us see the live setup connection.
When the push button is pressed, the LED glows as expected.
As there are 4 legs in the push button, the circuit can be built in another way as well.
Instead of using the leg B of the push button, we are using the leg D.
Since they are internally connected to each other, the LED glows when the push button is pressed.
Next, we’ll see the common mistakes people make while using push buttons.
Look at this image.
Recall that the legs A and C of the push button are internally connected.
Hence, the anode of the LED is always connected to 2nd power rail, irrespective of the push button.
The LED always glows in this circuit, even when the push button is OFF.
Let’s now move on to the seven-segment display.
The seven-segment display has sevenLEDs arranged in the shape of number eight.
There are two types of seven-segment displays: common anode and  common cathode seven segment display.
In a common cathode seven-segment display, pins a, b, c, d, e, f, g and dot must be connected to +5Volts.
The two COM pins must be connected to ground (GND).
The common anode display is the exact opposite.
Here, pins a, b, c, d, e, f, g and dot must be connected to ground.
Now, let us see how to connect a seven-segment display on the breadboard and glow all the LEDs.
The seven-segment display used here, in the image, is a common anode.
So, the common anodeis connected to the 2nd power rail through a resistor.
LED pins a, b, c, d, e, f, g, dot are connected to the 1st power rail.
If the connection is proper, we will see that all the LEDs are glowing.
Let us see the live setup connection.
We can see all the segments in the seven segment display is glowing.
In this tutorial, we learnt about Breadboard and its internal connections,
LED on the breadboard,  PushButton and Seven Segment Display on the breadboard.
The Spoken Tutorial forum is for specific questions on this tutorial.
This will help reduce the clutter.  With less clutter, we can use these discussion as instructional material.

Hello everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Steady State Response of Circuits.
Let's first define Steady state response of a circuit.
Steady state response is a period of observance when a circuit is in equilibrium condition.
Now, we will define phase shift. Phase shift is a relative change in the phase of a waveform.
Let us now study AC phase shift in RC circuit.
In this experiment, we will measure voltage variation and phase shift in the circuit.
To perform this experiment,
On the Plot window, click on A1 and drag to CH1.
Move the mSec/div slider to obtain the Sine waves.
Click on EXPERIMENTS button. Select Study of AC circuits.
Study of AC Circuits and Schematic windows open. Schematic window shows the circuit diagram.
Study of AC Circuits window displays three traces with different voltages.
Black trace is applied voltage at A1.
Red trace is the voltage across the resistor.
Blue trace is the voltage across the capacitor.
On the right side of the window, we can see Phasor plot.
On the plot, positive X-axis represents voltage across resistor.
Positive Y-axis represents voltage across inductor.
Negative Y-axis represents voltage across capacitor.
Frequency of the waves is 149.4Hz.
Calculator shows default values of frequency, resistance, capacitance and inductance.
Change the frequency value to 149.4Hz  and Inductor value to 0 mH (zero milli henry).
Click on Calculate XL, XC and Angle button.
The values of XC, XL and phase angle  are displayed. XC and XL are impedences of capacitance and inductance.
Dphi is phase shift. Calculated Phase shift is 46.8 degrees.
Let us calculate phase shift value using the formula: Φ (Phase shift) = arctan(XC/XR), where XC=1/2πfC.
Now, we will study AC phase shift in RL circuit.
In this experiment, we will measure phase shift when capacitor is replaced by an inductor.
To perform this experiment, A1 is connected to SINE.
560 Ohm resistor is connected between A2 and GND. This is the circuit diagram.
Two sine waves are generated.
Click on EXPERIMENTS button, select Study of AC circuits. Study of AC Circuits window opens.
On the right side of the window, we can see Phasor plot.
You can see that Phase Shift is -2.7 deg (minus 2.7 degree). Notice the values of frequency and voltages.
Change the value of:
Click on Calculate XL, XC and Angle button to view the values. Calculated phase shift is -3.1 deg(minus 3.1 degree).
Let us calculate phase shift value using the formula.
Phase shift (Φ) = arctan(XL/XR), where XL=2πfL. Here L is inductance.
External resistance value is 560 Ohm and resistance of the coil is 800 Ohm. Total resistance =( 560 Ohm + 800 Ohm)= 1360 Ohm.
Now, we will study AC phase shift  in LCR circuit.
We will measure phase shift when  inductor & capacitor are connected in the circuit.
To perform this experiment,  SINE is connected to A1.
Coil and 1 uF(1 micro farad) capacitor are connected between A1  and A2.
1K resistor is connected between A2 and ground (GND). This is the circuit diagram.
Two sine waves are generated with a phase shift.
Click on EXPERIMENTS button, select Study of AC Circuits.
Study of AC Circuits and Schematic windows open. Schematic window shows the circuit diagram.
Study of AC Circuits window displays three sine waves with different voltages.
On right side of the window, we can see Phasor plot.
Frequency of the waves is 149.4Hz,
Phase Shift is 43.1 deg(degree).
Change the value of:
Click on Calculate XL, XC and Angle button to view the values. Calculated phase shift value is 44.8 deg.
Let us calculate Phase shift value using the formula.
Phase shift Φ = arctan(XC – XL/XR).
External resistance value is 1000 Ohm. Calculated value of the phase shift  is 44.77 degrees.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on File handling using Scilab.
Input Function
Formatting the Output
save function
load function .
For demonstration I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 operating system with Scilab version 5.3.3 installed.
You should have basic knowledge of Scilab.
If not, for relevant spoken tutorials on Scilab  please visit spoken hyphen tutorial dot org.
The input() function is used to take the input from the user.
It provides a prompt in the text string for user input.
It waits for input from the keyboard.
If nothing but a carriage return is entered at the prompt, input() function returns an empty matrix.
The input function can be written in two ways:
First, x= input into brackets "message to display"
second, x= input into brackets ("message to display", "strings").
In the second example, the second argument is “string”.
So the output is a character string which is the expression entered using the keyboard.
Switch to the Scilab console window and type,
x is equal to input open bracket inside double quotes Enter your age close the double quotes close the bracket and press Enter.
Type 25 and press Enter.
Now type -->y is equal to input  into bracket into double quotes Enter your age close the double quotes comma again inside double quotes write string close the bracket and press Enter.
type 25 and press Enter.
We see that in both the cases the input we entered through  keyboard, was a number 25.
Now, let us check the type of variable that x and y are.
Let us clear the console using clc command.
We are doing this to validate the use and importance of the argument “string”, given in the second example.
To check the type of variable, let us type
-->typeof into brackets x and press Enter.
Similarly, typeof(y) and press Enter.
You can see it yourself that the first answer stored in x is of type constant and
second answer stored in y, with the argument “string” included in the command, is of type string.
Let us now see how to format the output that is displayed on the console.
This can be done using the mprintf() function.
mprintf() function converts, formats and writes data on to the Scilab console.
It is an interface for C-coded version of printf() function.
Let us see an example for this. Switch to the console.
Type-->mprintf into bracket into quotes type At iteration percent i comma Result is colon slash n alpha is equal to percentf comma 33 comma 0.535 close the bracket.
Here 33 will be displayed in place of percent i (%i) and point 535 (0.535) will be displayed in place of percent f (%f) as a flow. Press Enter.
This will give the output as  At iteration 33, Result is alpha is equal to 0.535000.
Clear the console. Now let us see another example.
mprintf open bracket into quotes Value of x is equal to percentage d is taken as a CONSTANT comma while value of y is equal to percent s is taken as a STRING close the quotes comma x comma y close the bracket.
In the above example percentage d (%d) is used to insert a constant data stored in variable x and
percentage s (%s) is used to insert a string data stored in variable y. press Enter, you see the output.
Now, let us discuss the use of save and load commands.
To quit Scilab midway through a calculation and to
continue at a later stage, type save thissession.
This will save the current values of all variables to a file called thissession.
This file cannot be edited.
It is in binary format.
When you next start Scilab, type load thissession
and the computation can be resumed where you left off.
The purpose of save and load functions are
The save() command saves all the Scilab current variables in a binary file.
If the variable is a graphic handle, the save function saves all the corresponding graphics_entities definition.
The file can be given either by its path or by its descriptor previously given.
save(filename) saves all the current variables in a file defined by filename.
save into bracket fd saves all the current variables in the file defined by the descriptor fd.
save(filename,x,y) or save(fd,x,y) saves only named variables x and y.
Let us see an example to illustrate the save and load commands usage.
Switch back to the console. Let us define two matrices, say a and b.
-->a = eye of (2,2) and press Enter.
Type b=ones(a) and press Enter.
Clear the console using clc command. Now type
save space matrix dash a dash b
or it can also be written as:
save into brackets into quotes matrix dash a dash b dot dat close the quotes comma a comma b close the bracket  and press Enter.
This saves the values of variables in a binary file 'matrix dash a dash b dot dat' (matrix-a-b.dat) in the present working directory.
You can browse the present working directory to check the existence of this binary file.
You can see it here. I will close the file browser.
Now let us load the file back in to the variables.
Before this, let us clear the variables a and b .
Type  clear a space b, press Enter.
Let us cross check if these variables are really cleared.
->a   , b
Now let us load back the values from the binary files in these variables a and b using the load command.
Type: load into bracket into quote matrix dash a dash b dot dat close the quotes comma into quotes a comma into quotes b close the bracket and press Enter.
Let us check the values in variables a and b. Clear the console.
Type -->a and-->b
You can see the values are loaded back in the variables.
In this tutorial we learnt -  Input function using input command

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Seven Segment Display.
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of electronics and  C or C++ programming language.
We will also require some external devices such as:
The seven-segment display has seven LEDs arranged in the shape of the digit eight.
There are two types of displays:
In the common cathode seven-segment display, pins a, b, c, d, e, f, g and dot must be connected to +5V.
The two COM pins must be connected to ground (GND).
The common anode seven-segment display is the exact opposite.
Here, pins a, b, c, d, e, f, g and dot must be connected to GND and the two COM pins must be connected to +5V.
Now, let us see the connection circuit details.
In this experiment, we will be using the common cathode seven-segment display.
Pins a, b, c, d, e, f and g of the seven-segment display are connected to pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of Arduino respectively.
Note that we didn't connect to pin 7.
The two common (COM) pins are connected to the ground through the resistors.
The resistor value should be greater than 220 ohms.
This is the live setup of the connection  as shown in the circuit diagram.
Now we will write a program in the Arduino IDE. So, let’s switch to the Arduino IDE.
First we will write a program to blink the LEDs in the seven segment display.
Type the code shown here.
We have assigned the segment names to the Arduino pins.
These help us to remember easily which Arduino ports are connected to the display’s segments.
This code is available in the code file link of this tutorial for your convenience. You can download and use it.
In the void setup function, we will use the function pinMode to configure the pin to output mode.
Now we will write the code for void loop.
The code is same as the ones in the earlier tutorials.
We will now compile and upload the program.
Now we can see that all the LEDs in the seven segment are glowing.
Next, we will modify the program to display some digits.
Say, we want to display the digit zero.
The LEDs of segment 'g' should be low and all other LED segments should be high.
To display '1', b and c segments should be high and the other LEDS should be low.
Let us switch back to the Arduino IDE.
Change the code in the void loop function, as shown here.
Let us now compile and upload the program.
You can see that the digits 0 to 4 are displayed, with a delay of 1 second between them.
In this tutorial, we learnt to
Try doing the following assignment.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Forces.
In this tutorial we will, Find the resultant of forces using addition of vectors.
Achieve an equilibrium condition using parallelogram of forces.
Here I am using,
Firefox Web Browser version 62.0.3
To follow this tutorial, learner should be familiar with Apps on Physics.
Use the given link to download the Apps.
I have already downloaded Apps on Physics to my Downloads folder.
In this tutorial we will use,
Right click on resultant_en.htm file.
Select the option Open with Firefox Web Browser.
Resultant of Forces App opens.
This is the interface of Resultant of Forces.
By default, App shows two vectors drawn from a fixed point.
We can click and drag the vectors to change their magnitude and direction.
In the green control panel there is a drop-down to change the Number of forces.
From the drop-down we can change the values from 2 to 5.
Click on Find out resultant button.
Notice that the second vector translates parallel to itself.
Vectors are add using head to tail method.
Observe that the red vector, is the resultant vector formed by addition of two vectors.
It is drawn from the point of contact to the head of the second vector.
Let us state triangle law of vector addition.
It states that, when two vectors are represented by two sides of a triangle with same magnitude and direction then the third side represents the resultant of vectors.
Click on Clear construction button to clear the resultant force.
From Number of forces drop-down select 5.
Click and drag the vectors to change their magnitude and direction.
Adjust the vectors to get equal magnitude for all vectors.
Then click on Find out resultant button.
Notice that each vector will get attached to the head of the previous vector.
The resultant is drawn, as its tail is joined to the tail of first vector and head to the head of last vector.
This represents polygon law of vector addition.
As an assignment
In each case, change the magnitude and direction.
Observe the resultant vectors and explain your observation.
Now let us explore Equilibrium of Three Forces.
To open the App right-click on equilibriumforces_en.htm file.
This is the interface of Equilibrium of Three Forces.
Below the name a short description about how to use interface is given.
The hanging weights represent the forces acting on the knot.
The green panel shows Left, Right and Below forces.
These forces are acting on the knot to achieve an equilibrium condition.
Notice that each force must be smaller than the sum of other two forces.
App has measured the Left angle as 30 degrees and Right side angle as 56 degrees.
Let us define equilibrium of forces.
When all the forces acting on an object are balanced, then the object is said to be in a state of equilibrium.
By default Parallelogram of forces check-box is selected.
If we uncheck the box, angles formed will not be seen.
Press F5 key on the keyboard to get the default view.
Let us change the forces to 6 newton, 4 newton, and 8 newton.
Note that 6 is smaller than the sum of 8 and 4.
Similarly 8 is smaller than the sum of 6 and 4.
This satisfies the above balance condition.
We can change the position of the pulleys using the mouse.
Choose 4 newton for Left, Right and Below forces.
Notice that for equal forces the Angle is always 60 degrees.
Use F5 button on the keyboard to refresh the App.
Change all the forces to 7 newton and observe the angles.
As an assignment - Try different combinations of forces to check the angles and equilibrium conditions.
Using these Apps we have,
Achieved an equilibrium condition using parallelogram of forces.
These Apps were created by Walter-fendt and his team.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on for and foreach Loops in Perl.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: for loop in Perl and
foreach loop in Perl.
You should have basic knowledge of variables and comments in Perl.
If not, please go through the relevant spoken tutorials on the spoken tutorial website.
Perl provides a mechanism by which we can check a condition repeatedly for various values. This is done using loops.
There are various types of loops in Perl:
for loop, foreach loop
while loop and do-while loop.
In this tutorial, we will cover for and foreach loop.
for loop in Perl can be used to execute a piece of code for a certain number of times.
The syntax of for loop is as follows:
for space open bracket variable initialization semicolon condition semicolon increment
close bracket, press Enter.
Open curly brackets,
piece of code to be executed multiple times,
close curly brackets.
Now let us look at an example of a for loop.
Open the Terminal and type: gedit forLoop.pl space & (ampersand)
and press Enter. This will open the forLoop.pl file in gedit.
Type the following piece of code: hash exclamation mark slash u s r slash bin slash perl
for space open bracket dollar i equals to zero semicolon space dollar i less than or equal to four semicolon space dollar i plus plus close bracket
space Open curly bracket  press Enter.
Type: print space double quote Value of i colon <space> dollar i backslash n  double quote complete semicolon
and press Enter. Now close curly bracket.
Let me explain what the for loop does.
The variable i is initialized to zero.
Next, the condition is checked.
In this case, the condition is i less than or equal to 4.
If this condition is true, the code within the curly bracket will be executed.
This means the first print statement  "Value of i colon 0"
will be displayed on the terminal.
After this, the variable 'i' is incremented by 1.
And the for loop condition is checked once again.
This loop will exit when the value of ' i' becomes greater than 4.
In this case, the for loop will be executed for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
which is a total of 5 times.
Now, switch to terminal.
perl hyphen c forLoop dot pl
Here it displays a message:
forLoop.pl syntax OK.
So, we have no errors.
Now, let us execute the Perl script by typing perl forLoop dot pl and press Enter.
The following output will be shown on the terminal.
Now, let us look at  foreach loop.
If we want to iterate a condition for an array, we can make use of foreach loop.
The syntax is: foreach space dollar variable space within brackets at the rate array  space
perform action on each element of an  array  press Enter,
close the curly bracket.
Please note: We'll cover array, array initialization and defining an array in subsequent tutorials.
Now let us look at an example of foreach loop.
Open the Terminal and type: gedit foreachLoop dot pl space ampersand and press Enter.
This will open the foreachLoop.pl file in gedit.
hash exclamation mark slash u s r slash bin slash perl and press Enter.
at the rate myarray space equal to space open bracket ten comma twenty comma thirty close the bracket semicolon
foreach space dollar var space open bracket at the rate myarray close the bracket space
print space double quotes Element of an array is colon dollar var backslash n  double quotes complete semicolon
press Enter and close the curly bracket.
Let me explain what this code does. An array myarray is declared.
It has 3 elements 10, 20 and 30.
In each iteration of foreach loop, 'dollar var' ($var) will contain the single element of an array.
foreach keyword will repeat this loop for each element of an array.
That is, the code within the curly bracket will be executed for each myarray element.
Back-slash n (\n) will place the prompt on a new line.
This means, the first element 10 will be displayed on the terminal.
Then 20 and so on, till all the elements are printed.
This loop will exit after printing all the elements in myarray.
Type: perl hyphen c foreachLoop dot pl and press Enter.
The following line will be shown on the terminal.
There are no compilation or syntax errors.
So, let us execute the Perl script.
Type:  perl foreachLoop dot pl and press Enter.
The following output will be shown on the terminal.
So, that's it about for loop and foreach loop.
In this tutorial, we have learnt -
for loop and foreach loop in Perl
using some sample programs. Here is an assignment for you -
Declare a string as 'Spoken Tutorial' and

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Wireless Connectivity to Arduino
Establish Wireless Communication between ESP and other devices
To follow this tutorial, you should have a basic knowledge of:
C or C++ programming language and
Wireless Communication
Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS and  Arduino IDE
We will require a few external components such as
Breadboard
Jumper Wires and  Push Button
In this tutorial we will use ESP8266-01 WiFi module.
VCC, RST, CH_PD, Tx, Ground, GPIO2, GPIO0, Rx are the pins of the Wi-Fi module.
Power LED indicates whether the module is ON or OFF.
COMM LED is the built-in blue LED of the WiFi module.
In this tutorial, we will see how to control this built-in LED using WiFi.
This WiFi module has a built-in System on Chip with integrated TCP/IP stack.
It has a UART and 2 GPIO pins (General Purpose Input / Output).
It is widely used for development of IoT (i.e. Internet of Things) applications.
This is the circuit connection of ESP8266 - 01 module with Arduino.
Note: The ESP8266-01 module works on 3.3 Volts only.
Connecting it to 5 Volts may damage the Wi-Fi module.
Connect ground pin of Wi-Fi module to ground pin of Arduino.

Hello everyone! Welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Building the walls of the slurry tank.
This is an activity to be done on Day-2.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to build the walls of the slurry tank.
Let’s first understand what is a slurry tank.
Slurry is the most important by-product of the fermentation that takes place inside the digester tank.
This slurry comes out of the digester tank and is collected in the slurry tank.
Let's look at the position of the slurry tank with respect to the biogas plant.
The slurry tank is placed in line with the entrance of the dome.
So, what is the shape of the tank?
These tanks are rectangular in shape.
What you see here is the pictorial representation of the slurry tank.
The slurry tank is divided into Small tank and the upper tank. The small tank is enclosed within the upper tank.
Notice the pink colored walls of the smaller tank enclosed inside the blue colored upper tank.
Also note, the upper tank has an outlet hole. The lower tank is in line with the entrance to the digester tank.
So, in total, how many walls have to be built for constructing the slurry tank?
Total 7 walls have to be constructed to build the slurry tank.
The various dimensions are shown in the image.
Items used for construction are  steel rods and  Chicken mesh.
Detailed specifications of these are mentioned in the tutorial on material required.
To begin with, insert one of the three steel rods through the holes of the chicken mesh.
Insert these steel rods through sufficient number of holes. This will ensure that the rod will not slide while placing it on the cement plaster.
Next, lay a plastic sheet on the ground.
Use a measuring tape to mark boundary for height, width,  breadth.
We will spread the cement mixture within this boundary, on the plastic sheet.
Prepare cement mixture as follows-  sand- 150 kgs,
cement-50 kgs,
liquid waterproofing material -150 ml- thoroughly stirred in 20 litrs of water,
adequate water to mix the cement mixture well.
Note that no gravel is used in this mixture.
To begin with, first spread 1.5 inches thickness of the cement mixture. Spread it between the boundary of the wall.
Now carefully place the chicken mesh with inserted steel rods on this cement mixture.
This chicken mesh with inserted steel rods serves as a support for the cement mixture.
Care should be taken to leave an extra 4-5 inches of chicken mesh at either sides of each wall.
This will be entwined or interlocked with the chicken mesh left at the edges of the dome. Doing this will help fixing the walls of the slurry tank with the dome.
In the earlier two images, we saw a hole in only one of the walls of the slurry tank.
Now, let’s talk about the significance of this hole.
It is this hole from where the slurry smoothly comes and flows out to the agricultural field.
So, how to make this hole in the wall of the slurry tank?
To make a hole, use the inlet pipe of 6 inches diameter. Attention should be paid to this particular wall before fitting the pipe on it.
To begin with, use a scissor and cut the chicken mesh to make a hole of 6 inches diameter.
Then insert the steel rods as explained earlier on either side of the 6 inch diameter hole.
Now, lay this mesh with a hole on the cement mixture spread on the plastic sheet.
The thickness of this cement mixture should be 1.5 inches.
Exactly on this hole, place the inlet pipe of 6 inches diameter firmly in an upright position.
Before placing it, please remember to flatten the edges of the inlet pipe so that it can stand on its own.
Importantly, the pipe should be placed when the cement mixture is still wet.
As each step is followed by another, in quick succession, the mason should plan well. This will help him not to loose time and the right moment.
Now, spread cement mixture around the pipe using the small trowel.
This will make the pipe stand firmly.
Note that the pipe will be removed when the cement is dry.
After the pipe is removed, this is how the hole would look like.
The prepared walls are left for drying for 2 days and will be used on day-4.
Assembly of the walls of the tank will be explained in a later tutorial.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt how to build the walls of the slurry tank.

Welcome to this tutorial on Radioactive Dating Game, an interactive PhET simulation.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate, Radioactive Dating Game, an interactive PhET simulation.
Here I am using,
Learners should be familiar with high school physics and chemistry.
Using this simulation, we will look at
Let us begin.
I have already downloaded the Radioactive Dating Game simulation to my Downloads folder.
Type java space hyphen jar space radioactive-dating-game underscore en dot jar, press Enter.
This is the interface for the Radioactive Dating Game simulation.
The interface has four screens:
We are already looking at the Half Life screen.
At the top of the screen is an Isotope versus Time graph.
Pay attention to the units of time.
On the right side of the screen, you see a Choose Isotope panel.
It has three options showing unstable nucleus decaying to stable nucleus.
In the middle is the simulation panel containing a Bucket o’ Atoms.
Note that it contains C-14 atoms as the default selection is C-14.
Attached to the bottom of the bucket is a button called “Add 10”.
Stable and Unstable Nuclei
The energy associated with this force is the binding energy.
The lower the binding energy, the more unstable is the nucleus.
Such an unstable nucleus is said to be radioactive.
Below the simulation panel is a Play/Pause button and a Step button next to it.
In the simulation panel is a blue Reset All Nuclei button.
It lets you return to the start but with the selected isotope.
Below the right panel is a white Reset All button.
It resets the simulation in this screen to all the default settings.
Observe the Isotope versus time graph.
There is a vertical red dashed line labeled Half Life near the 5000 year mark.
The half-life of C-14 is 5730 years.
Along the y-axis, you can see the red C-14 symbol above the blue N-14 symbol.
C-14 atoms will appear in the upper row and N-14 atoms in the lower one.
To the left of the Isotope label is a red circle.
Numbers of C-14 and N-14 atoms shown by hash symbols will appear to the left of the circle.
Radioactive Decay
It involves the release of subatomic particles and their energy as radiation.
It is of the following types:
Half-life is the time taken for half of the nuclei in a radioactive material to decay.
Let us get back to the simulation.
Click on Add 10 and immediately click on the Pause button.
Ten C-14 atoms have been added to the simulation panel.
Almost immediately, red C-14 has started to decay to give blue N-14.
Observe the atoms moving across the graph in the two rows.
Note how the circle changes to blue as more N-14 atoms form.
Keep clicking on Step button to the right of Pause.
The circle is half red and half blue.
Observe that there are 5 blue N-14 atoms in the graph.
There are 5 C-14 atoms and 5 N-14 atoms in the simulation panel also.
This is the definition of half-life.
If you click again on Add 10, another 10  C-14 atoms will be added to the simulation panel.
Predict the number of C-14 atoms remaining after different periods.
Perform the same simulation for the other nuclei.
Click on the Decay Rates tab to go to that screen.
The interface has a similar arrangement as the Half Life screen.
Please explore this screen in the same way.
Now, let us click on the Measurement tab to go to that screen.
In the right panel, under Choose an Object, we will stay with Tree, the default selection.
In the top left, under Probe Type, we will retain the default selections, Carbon-14 and Objects.
In the bottom right corner, click on Plant Tree button.
Immediately click on the Pause button.
Observe 100% appear above Probe Type in the upper left corner.
Keep clicking on the Step button to the right of Pause to move the simulation along.
Above the graph, % of C-14 is the default selection.
The white box below the graph shows the number of years since the tree was planted.
The red line shows % of C-14 remaining in the tree.
Click on the second C-14 to C-12 ratio radio button above the graph.
Now the red line shows the C-14 to C-12 ratio in the tree.
Click again on the % of C-14 radio button above the graph.
Keep track of the % in the top left, the tree and the number of years below the graph.
Note down the number of years and % of C-14 when the tree
Click on the Play or Step buttons to get approximately  50% in the top left window.
Note the number of years after which you see 50% of C-14 in the tree.
Click on Rock and Uranium-238 radio buttons.
Click on Erupt Volcano and Cool rock buttons.
Measure U-238 levels in the cooled volcanic rock.
Click on the Air radio button to compare isotope levels in objects to air levels.
Let us click on the last Dating Game tab to go to that screen.
We can measure levels of C-14, U-238 or other custom nuclei in this screen.
We see objects on and below the ground on which we can place the probe to measure these levels.
Radioactive Dating
Both are converted to carbon dioxide and are taken in by living organisms.
When an organism dies, it no longer takes in any carbon. So levels of C-14 and ratio of C-14 to C-12 fall.
Radioactive Dating-Continued
It estimates how long the organism has been dead.
Uranium-lead dating is used for rocks, archaeological artefacts etc.
On the top, we see the graph like the ones in the previous screens.
Let us keep the following default selections:
We will drag the probe and place it on the animal skull on the ground, to the left.
Observe a pop-up box that appears next to the skull.
We see the text, “Estimate age of Animal Skull” and “years” next to the empty box below.
Below this is a Check Estimate button.
Observe that in the top left side, above Probe Type, we see 98.2%.
Let us drag the double-headed green arrow above the graph.
In the white box above the arrow, % of C-14 should be approximately 98.2%.
Observe that t equals 123 yrs appears in the white box above the graph.
Type 123 in the empty box below Estimate age of Animal Skull.
Click Check Estimate button.
The Estimate pop-up box disappears.
A green text-box with 123 years appears in its place with a green smiley face next to it.
We have successfully dated the animal skull by measuring the % of C-14 remaining in it.
Correlate age in years with percentage of unstable nucleus.
Correlate age in years with the depth at which the object is found.
Remember to use C-14 for animal remains and U-238 for rocks and other objects.
In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to use the Radioactive Dating Game PhET simulation.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Simulating a PID controller using Xcos.
In this tutorial we will learn how to implement a PID controller in Xcos.
Ensure that Scilab is installed on your computer.
I am recording this tutorial on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit Operating System and using Scilab 6.0.0
As a pre-requisite, watch the tutorial Xcos Introduction.
This tutorial will make you comfortable with the Xcos environment.
Also, we will use the firstorder.xcos file created in that tutorial.
Hence, it is important that you practice the tutorial before continuing so that you have the file with you.
Some basic knowledge of PID controller is necessary.
Assuming that you have satisfied the pre-requisites, let us begin with the tutorial.
First of all, we will launch Scilab.
Then go to Applications and select Xcos.
Or in your Scilab console window, type Xcos and press Enter.
By doing this, two windows will open.
On the Untitled-Xcos window, click on File and then click on Open.
Browse to the directory where the file firstorder.xcos is saved.
Choose that file and click on Ok.
Now, Double-click on the transfer function block.
Check that you are using the same transfer function as I am using.
For me, the numerator is 1 and denominator is 2 asteric s plus 1
Click on Ok.
Double-click on the Step block.
Check that you are using the same step input parameters as I am using.
For me the Step time is 1, the Initial value is 0 and the Final value is 2.
Click on Simulation on the menu bar and choose Start to simulate the file.
Expect a similar plot which ensures that the file has no mistakes.
Switch to the Palette Browser.
Click on Continuous time systems category.
Drag and drop the PID block, which is here, inside the Xcos window
Click on the Signal Routing category.
Drag and drop the Mux block, which is here, inside the Xcos window.
Click on Mathematical Operations category.
Drag and drop the Summation block, which is here, inside the Xcos window.
Note that this block, by default, subtracts the second input from the first input.
We will use this default configuration of the summation block.
Click on the line joining the step input block and transfer function block.
Then press the Delete button to delete it.
Drag the step input block away from the transfer function block.
Click on the line joining the transfer function block and the cscope block.
Then press the Delete button to delete it.
Drag the cscope and clock input block away from the transfer function block
Place the PID block before the transfer function block.
Place the summation block before the PID block.
Place the Mux block between the transfer function block and cscope block.
Adjust the blocks, if required, so that they all come in a line.
Connect the step input block to the first input port of the summation block.
Note that this is the positive input port of the summation block.
Connect the output port of summation block to the input port of PID block.
Connect the output port of PID block to the input port of transfer function block.
Connect the output port of transfer function block to the lower input port of Mux block.
Connect the output port of Mux block to the input port of the cscope block.
Locate the line connecting the step input block and the summation block.
Connect the input port of Mux to that line.
Use the left mouse click to create line bends while making the connection.
Locate the line joining the transfer function block and the Mux block.
Connect the second input port of the summation block to that line. Use line bends wherever necessary.
Double-click on the PID block to open its parameter setting dialog box.
Here you can set the Proportional, Integral and Derivative gains.
Please note that the Integral gain should be considered as 1 by tau I, where tau I is the integral time.
We will use the default settings. Click on Cancel to use the default settings.
We are now ready to run the simulation.
Notice that we are using the step input block as a setpoint variable.
The PID controller will generate an input to the Transfer Function block.
It will be such that the output of the transfer function block matches the setpoint.
Click on  Start simulation button available on the menu bar.
Expect a graphic window to open. It will have two variables plotted in a single plot.
The step plot is the setpoint which has a final value of 2.
The curved plot which is green in color, is the output of the transfer function which tries to meet the setpoint value of 2.
You can now change the PID settings and learn how they affect the output.
Pause the video here and solve the given exercises.
Implement a Proportional Controller only. That is, only P and not PID
Change the proportional gain such that the setpoint matches the output but without overshoots.
Include the output of the summation block in the plot.
You may use CMSCOPE to keep it separate.
Compare it visually with the output of the PID block
In this tutorial we learnt : To modify the firstorder.xcos file to implement a PID controller

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Multiple and Hierarchical Inheritance in C++.
Multiple Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance.
We will do this with the help of examples.
Ubuntu OS version 11.10 and
g++ compiler version 4.6.1
Now, we will see an example on multiple inheritance.
Note that our file name is multiple.cpp.
In this program, we will display the name, roll no, marks and average of the student.
Then we have class student.
This is the base class.
In this, we have roll_no as integer variable and name as character variable.
These are declared as protected.
Then we have another class exam_inherit.
This is also a base class.
Hence we have two base classes here-  student and exam_inherit.
In this, we have 3 variables-  sub1, sub2 and sub3 as protected.
This is because protected variables can be accessed by derived class.
Now, here we have class "grade" which is the derived class.
This inherits the base classes – class "student"' and class "exam_inherit".
In this, we have avg as integer variable declared as private.
Then we have functions:
'input()'display()
'average()'input_exam()
and display_exam() as public functions.
In this, we have total as integer variable declared as public.
Then, we use input() function to accept the roll_no and name of the student.
In display() function, we display the roll_no and name of the student.
Here, we have function input_exam().
In this, we accept the marks of three subjects as sub1, sub2 and sub3.
Then in display_exam() function, we calculate the total of three subjects and print the total.
And in function average(), we calculate the average.
In this, we create an object of class grade which is the derived class as gd.
Then we call all the above functions.
This is our return statement.
To compile, type: g++ space multiple dot cpp space  hyphen o space mult. Press Enter.
Type: dot slash mult. Press Enter.
I will enter as 3.
I will enter as Pratham.
Enter marks of subject1:
I will give as 67.
subject2 as 78 and.
subject3 as 84.
'Roll no is: 3'Name is: Pratham
Total is: 229
Average is: 76.
This was multiple inheritance.
Now, we will see hierarchical inheritance.
In hierarchical inheritance,  multiple derived classes inherit from one base class.
Note that our 'file name' is hierarchical dot cpp.
I will explain the code now.
Here we have used the std namespace.
Then, we have class  student which is the base class.
In this, we have roll_no as integer variable.
Sub1, sub2, sub3 and total as integer variables.
Then name as character variable.
These are declared protected.
Here, we have another class 'show'.
It inherits the properties of class student.
In this, we have two functions: input() and display().
These are declared as public functions.
In function input(), we accept the roll_no and name of the student.
In function display(), we display the roll_no and name of the student.
Then we have another derived class as class exam.
This also inherits class student.
You can see that there are two derived classes- class exam and class show.
Both the classes inherit the class "student".
In class exam, we have two functions as input_exam() and total_marks() declared as public.
Here, we access the function input_exam().
It accepts the marks of three subjects- sub1, sub2 and sub3.
Then we have  total_marks() function.
It calculates the total of three subjects and prints the total.
In this, we create objects of three classes as st, sw and em.
Then we call all the above functions using these objects.
Let us compile, type: g++ space  hierarchical dot cpp space  hyphen o space hier
Press Enter.Type: dot slash hier
Enter Roll no.:I will give as 4.
Enter Name:I will give as Ashwini.
Enter marks of subject1
I will give as 87.
subject2 as 67 and subject3 as 97.
Roll no is: 4
Name is: Ashwini and
Total is : 251This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt-
Multiple Inheritance and
Hierarchical Inheritance.
As an assignment: Create a class area and perimeter.
Find the area and perimeter of rectangle.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Introduction to Arrays.
In this tutorial, you will learn how  to create arrays and  access elements in arrays.
For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of data types and for loop in Java.
Arrays are a collection of data.
For example, a list of marks, a list of names, a list of temperatures, a list of rainfall.
Each item has an index, based on its position.
The index of the first element is 0.
The index of the  second element is  1 and so on.
Let us now see how to store this data.
So switch to Eclipse.
A class named ArraysDemo has already been created.
Within the main method, let us add the rainfall data.
So, inside main function, type:
int rainfall open  and 	close square  brackets equal to within curly brackets type 25, 31, 29, 13, 27, 35, 12 and finally the semicolon.
Note that the square braces after the variable name rainfall.
This declares rainfall as an array of integers.
The braces are used to specify the elements of the array.
Let us now access data.
So on the next line, type:
System  dot out  dot  println rainfall in square brackets type 2.
We are printing the element with the index number 2.
In other words, the third element in the array i.e. 29.
Let us save and run the program.
As  we can see, the output is the third element, i.e 29.
Now, let us type 0 in place of 2.
Save and run the program.
As we can see, the output is the first value i.e 25.
Now, let us modify the value of the first item.
So, type: rainfall[0] = 11;
Now, let us see its value. So save and run the program.
As we can see, the value has been changed to 11.
Now, what if we  know only the size of the array and do not know the values.
Let us see how to create such array.
Remove everything in main function and type:
int squares[] = new int[10];
This statement creates an array of integers having 10 elements. The name of the array is squares.
Now, let us add some values to it.
So, type:
squares[0] = 1;
Next line, squares[1] = 4;
Next line, squares[2] = 9;
squares[3] = 16;
So, we have entered the squares of first four numbers.
Now what about the other elements of the array. Let us see what they contain.
So, we shall print the sixth value in the array.
Type: System S capital .out.println(squares[5]);
Save and run the program. We see that the value is zero.
This is because when we create an array of integers, all the values are initialized to 0.
Similarly, an array of floats will have all its values initialized to 0.0.
It would be a long process if we have to type each value into the array. Instead, let us use a for loop.
So, type:
So, we iterate over numbers from 4 to 9 and set the corresponding element in the array.
As we can see, we are printing the  value of sixth element in  array. So, Save and run.
We see the sixth element is now square of 6 which is 36.
In fact, now we can set all the values inside the for loop.
Remove the lines that set the values manually and change 4 to 0.
This way, all the elements from index 0 to 9 are set to the corresponding squares.
We shall now see the value of the third element.
So, change 5 to 2.
Save and run.
As we can see, the value of the third element has been set in the loop and it is 9.
This way, arrays can be created and used.
To declare and initialize an array.
And access an element in an array.
The assignment for this tutorial is:
Given an array of integers, find the sum of all the elements in the array.
It summarizes the project. If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch it.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Common Mistakes while Installing Joomla and Uninstalling Joomla on a local server.
For this tutorial, we will be using:
To follow this tutorial, you need to have XAMPP and Joomla  installed on your system.
You also need to have knowledge of the Joomla installation process.
If not, check the relevant tutorial in the Joomla series, on the spoken tutorial  website.
First of all, let me start XAMPP on my machine.
Let's open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T  keys.
Alternately, click on the “Terminal” icon in the launcher bar.
Start  XAMPP  by typing sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space start  and press Enter.
It will prompt for administrative password.
Let me type my administrative password and press Enter.
Now we have XAMPP running.
The first mistake one can make is to extract Joomla in a different directory.
Go to the browser and open the  XAMPP  page by typing http colon double slash localhost and press Enter.
In the menu on the left of the screen, click on phpinfo().
Now press Ctrl +F  keys and search for DOCUMENT underscore ROOT.
Value of DOCUMENT underscore ROOT will be either slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs or  slash var slash www.
Please note that Joomla needs to be extracted in the apache DOCUMENT underscore ROOT directory.
If this is not the case, the installation setting page would not show up at all.
Second common mistake that one can make is to have the output buffering ON.
In the 3rd step of the installation setup, output buffering  should be marked as OFF.
This is a recommended setting and not a required setting.
Usually, by default, it is turned OFF.
If  output buffering is ON, installation might proceed successfully.
However, the website might be extremely slow later.
In some cases, installation might hang up at this step.
In case it is ON, we can turn it  OFF by editing  php.ini  in the apache installation.
We will go to the terminal window and locate php.ini first by typing locate space php dot ini and press  Enter.
We may get a number of results for this query.
There will be one result in which php.ini will be inside the etc directory.
This directory is inside the lampp directory, inside the opt directory.
This is the one we need to edit.
In my machine, the path to that file is slash opt slash lampp slash etc slash php.ini.
We open the file in Gedit text editor  by typing  sudo space gedit space slash opt slash lampp slash etc slash php dot ini.
If prompted, enter your admin password.
You will have to do so whenever prompted, as we proceed.
Gedit is the default text-editor preloaded in Ubuntu Linux.
Alternately, you can use any text editor of your choice.
When the file is open, search for output underscore buffering.
The first search result we get is commented. So, we check for the next result.
Here we find the text we are looking for.
Change  output underscore buffering = 4096 to output underscore buffering = off.
We save the file by pressing  Control + S  keys.
We can then exit the Gedit  editor.
We need to restart XAMPP for the change to get reflected.
Switch to the terminal and type: sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space restart.
Press  Enter.
So, we can proceed to the next step.
The third mistake you can make is to have no write permission for the configuration file.
In the last step of installation, you might get an error that says “Your configuration file or directory is not writable or there was a problem creating the configuration file”.
This occurs when we forget to give  write permission to the  Joomla folder.
If this error occurs, you will get some text inside a text box.
We will copy this text using Control + C keys.
In this case, we can create a new  configuration.php file and paste the text into it.
We will use the touch command to create the configuration.php inside our joomla folder.
At the command prompt, type: sudo space touch space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash joomla slash configuration dot php.
Then type: sudo space gedit space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash joomla slash configuration dot php.
This will open the file in Gedit text editor.
Paste the copied text inside this file.
Check the file to make sure left bracket, question mark, php is present as the first line of the file and the content is exactly the same.
Save the configuration.php by pressing Control + S keys.
We can then exit the Gedit  editor.
Now we have the configuration.php for our Joomla installation.
Now, we will see the fourth mistake that one can make during the  Joomla installation.
This is to not delete the installation  folder in the Finish step.
I cannot emphasize the importance of this step enough.
This is one of the most common mistakes.
So, make sure the folder is deleted.
If you get an error in this step, you must remove the folder manually.
I got an error because I am not logged-in as linux superuser and don't have delete permission.
So, now let us switch to the  terminal.
We will delete the Joomla installation folder manually, from the joomla folder.
This is mandatory. So, type: cd slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash joomla.
Then type:  sudo space rm space minus rf space installation forward slash.
Press  Enter.
We have now successfully installed  Joomla.
We can check this by going to the browser and typing  http colon double slash localhost slash joomla.
We can see our webpage.
We will now talk about uninstalling  Joomla.
We need to first delete the folder into which we extracted  Joomla.
So, I will switch to the terminal and type:  sudo space rm space minus rf space forward slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash joomla slash.
Now, type: cd forward slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash joomla.
This is to check if the folder is deleted.
As you can see, the directory does not exist.
We will then delete the database and the users.
This step will uninstall Joomla completely.
I will first go to the browser and type: http colon double slash localhost slash phpmyadmin.
I will click on the  Users  tab and select the user  Joomla-1.
Below, there is an option- Drop the databases that have same names as the users. Click on it.
This will give you a prompt . You are about to DESTROY a complete database! Do you really want to execute DROP DATABASE? Click on OK.
Now click on GO button at the bottom right.
We have now successfully uninstalled  Joomla from our localhost.
Let's come to the assignment now.
Install  Joomla.
The video at this link, summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project.
This is Priyanka, signing off. Thank you for joining.
Each of them is associated with a well-known file-descriptor.
Now, if we write wc space left-angled bracket space test1 dot txt.
Now type: wc space test1 dot txt.
Instead, it looks to pick up the input from standardin.
But, actually it is unaware as to from where the data is coming to standardin.
If it does exist, the existing contents are usually lost without any warning.
So, just a right angle bracket is same as 1 right angle-bracket.
Let us see this practically.
Say, we write:  wc space test1 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' wc_results dot txt .
Yes! it has.Suppose, we have another file test2 in the same directory.
Now, we again execute the command with test2 file. We type:
Instead, if we write wc space test1 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' twice wc underscore results dot txt
Like we know that their exists no file by the name 'aaa', write the following wc space aaa.
The shell will give the error: "No such file or directory".
For this, we may give the command  wc space aaa space 2 'right angled- bracket' errorlog dot txt.
Now, suppose that I make some other error by running the command:
But, what if we want to list all errors?? Simple! we would run the command: wc space aaa space 2 'right-angled bracket' twice errorlog dot txt.
It looks like:  command1 vertical bar command2 hyphen option vertical bar command3 hyphen option1 hyphen option2 vertical bar command4
What we can do? We know
We can redirect the output to a file.ls space minus l 'right-angled bracket' files dot txt.
This we can do using the command: wc space minus  l files dot txt.
We can do it much easily using pipes like this. We write:
Type: cd space slash user slash bin.
Now, run ls minus l.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on introduction to data frames in R.
I am Kannan Moudgalya.
In this tutorial, we will explain
how to create a data frame in R
how to work with it
how to save it into a file and
how to read data from a file into a data frame
We will also learn about the data sets that come with the R software
To understand this tutorial,
One needs to know elementary maths
for example, the meaning of mean, row and column
One needs to know how to edit a text file and plotting
No programming background is required, however
Anyone with a simple exposure to statistics can understand this tutorial
Please locate this tutorial on our web page, spoken hyphen tutorial dot org
Prerequisite spoken tutorials, if any, will be mentioned in this page
I am using version 3 of R
But it should work in other versions and also other operating systems.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
Let us begin with the “c” command to create a vector
Notice that I am using the assignment operator, that is, less than followed by hyphen.
I will use the word get to denote this assignment.
This is the way to create a vector of three elements.
c stands for create or concatenate.
Although the equal to sign works most of the time, one usually uses this operator in R.
Let us view what the vector sample contains.
Let us now build a data set.
We will also call it as a data frame in this tutorial.
Let me create a vector of Indian Cricket Captains, old and new.
names gets c of Mahi, Sourav, Azhar, Sunny, Pataudi, Dravid
Each name has to be entered in between double quotes.
Let us view what the variable names contains.
I will create a vector to store the number of matches they captained.
One can see that all the variables got entered in the workspace.
Now, let us put these together and create a data frame as I do now.
It is data dot frame.
Let us understand what the command data frame does.
To do this, let us View brackets captaincy.
The contents of the data frame appear nicely in the window above.
What will happen if you just type captaincy, without the View command?
Would you want to try it now?
In statistics, one works with such data sets.
Remember, the commands and variables in R are case sensitive.
The View command begins with a capital V.
It is easy to access the parts of a data frame.
For example, this is how I will get the names in the captaincy data frame.
Let us similarly get the number of matches won.
Let us find the ratio of matches won.
When we divide a vector by another, R carries out component-wise division.
Let us include this ratio also in the captaincy data frame.
captaincy dollar victory gets ratio.
What is in ratio gets transferred to victory, a variable in the data frame captaincy.
We can check that ratio is included in captaincy by the View command.
We can see that the ratio is included in victory.
Let us reduce the number of digits displayed in the ratio to 2.
We do this with the command options within brackets digits=2.
Let us view captaincy
We can see that it has been reduced to two digits.
Let us see the number of matches played by all the captains.
Let us find the mean of these matches.
By direct calculation, we find that mean does exactly what it should.
These two are equal.
Let us now get some plots with this data frame.
Let us plot the ratio of victories vs. the year of captaincy.
Remember that the x axis variable has to be listed first in the plot command.
Let us plot the number of matches captained versus the names of the captains.
Drag this a little bit. The graph expands. Put it back.
We will now explain how to write this data frame to a comma separated variable file or C S V.
We will use the command write.csv, as we do now.
Let me move this to the right.
This writes the captaincy data frame into the file NewCaptaincy.csv
Let me open this file using my favourite text editor, emacs.
You may use any other text editor, such as notepad or vi or gedit.
Please do not, however, use Microsoft office or LibreOffice Writer for this purpose.
Because, you may not be able to load these files into R.
Let us now see what the file NewCaptaincy.csv contains.
This csv file contains everything that we created.
It also contains row numbers in every row, at the beginning.
How will you get rid of these row numbers?
Add an additional flag called row dot names equals FALSE.
Let us read the new version of this file in emacs.
In emacs, I just have to refresh it.
In other editors, you may have to re-open the file.
We see that the row numbers no longer appear.
Let us make a small change in this csv file and read it.
Let us change Mahi to Dhoni and save the file.
Let us click Import Dataset.
There are two options:
from the text file and from the web.
Reading from a local file is a fool-proof method.
It works even if Internet is not available.
All one has to do is to download the required files ahead of time.
Let us click the File option.
Let us select NewCaptaincy.
In order to see this, let's maximise this, let's Import this, let manimise this.
You will not have this problem, of course, because, you will be using the whole screen.
For this tutorial, I am using only a small portion of the screen.
And that’s why we have had this problem.
The appearance of a data frame called NewCaptaincy here, and also here, shows that it has been          read.
It also has Dhoni as the name.
The row numbers have also disappeared.
It is also possible to read excel and ods files into R.
This involves a little more work and hence not covered in this tutorial.
It is easy to export excel and ods files into csv format.
So, for now, please use the csv route to import excel or ods files.
Let us take up the final topic for this tutorial.
R comes with several data frames.
To access them, issue the command data brackets.
R shows a list of available data frames.
We can carry out all sorts of calculations on these data sets.
We will just view one data set, called C O 2.
We will conclude this tutorial here.
In this tutorial, we learnt the following:
We created vectors
We put the vectors into a data frame
We operated on the data frame
We saved the data frame into a file
Imported the file into R
Examined the data frames that came with R
We now suggest an assignment.
Find out how to calculate median using the help button.
Repeat the above using web search.
Calculate the mean and median of the data frame C O 2.
Take R’s help for all the commands shown in this tutorial.
Import a data set from the Internet directly or through a file.
If you do not have good bandwidth, you may download and watch it.

Thank you for joining.
In this tutorial, we will explain how to create block diagrams of the type given below.
We will see the tools required for this purpose:
I shall use Xfig, a block diagram manipulation tool.
I am using version 3.2, patch level 5.
I will also use the terminal and a 'pdf' browser.
I am creating this tutorial on Mac OS X.
Xfig works on Linux and Windows also.
Installation on Linux is the easiest of all.
The procedure to use Xfig is the same in all three.
It is recommended to use a three button mouse for Xfig.
But one or two button mouse can also be configured to work.
The user manual for Xfig is available on the web.
Let us see it. We can see the introduction to Xfig in this page.
We can see the Table of Contents of this manual, here.
Let us click on it.
We can see the details of the people who created Xfig, here.
Let us see this page.
I will now explain the screen configuration for this tutorial.
It has the slides, Xfig, internet browser – Firefox and the terminal.
This is the command I used to invoke Xfig on Mac.
These are arranged in an overlapping fashion, for easy switch from one to the other.
The listener can easily see the switch happening – no need for guess work.
Let us start with Xfig.
The left hand side of Xfig worksheet has the drawing mode panel.
The buttons on top half of this panel can be used to create different objects.
The ones in the bottom are used to work with them.
Using the buttons at the top, one can carry out File and Edit operations.
The space in the centre is known as the canvas.
This is where the figure will be created.
Let us now get started with drawing.
The first thing I will do is to put the grids on the canvas.
I do this by clicking on the Grid Mode button, at the bottom.
We can choose different grid sizes. I will choose the middle one.
Grids help align the different objects that we would place.
In this tutorial, by clicking I mean clicking the left mouse button and releasing it.
Similarly, selecting or choosing a button would mean that you have to click it with the left mouse.
If a different action is required, I will state it explicitly.
As our diagram should have a box, let us choose the Box symbol with sharp corners, from the left hand side panel.
We will go to the place where we want to place the box.
We will click the mouse at this point.
This selects the north west corner of the box.
Move the mouse to the opposite end until the box is of the size we want.
Once the box is of right size, we can click the mouse once again.
The box is now created.
We will now explain how to use the Edit feature of Xfig.  Using this, we will increase the thickness of the box.
Let us press the Edit button in the left hand panel.
We see that all the key points of the box are displayed.
Let us click on any one of these points and thus select the box.
A dialog-box opens.
We will take the mouse to the Width box.
Make sure that the mouse pointer stays within the box.
Let us delete the default value of 1.
The contents of this box cannot be changed if the mouse is not inside the box.
If the mouse moves away at any time of entry in the box, please bring it inside and continue typing.
Let us now enter 2.
We click the Done. Let me show you this.
Click the Done and leave the dialog-box.
We see that the thickness of the box has increased.
We would now want to enter lines with arrows.
Let us choose the POLYLINE button from the left hand side panel.
The panel at the bottom is known as the Attributes panel.
Using the buttons present in this panel, the parameters of each object may be changed.
The number of buttons change depending on the chosen object.
Let us select the Arrow Mode button from the attributes panel.
Let us choose the second option in the dialog-box as this would give an arrow at the end point.
Let us click the Arrow Type button.
In the window that appears, we select the arrow head of our choice.
Let us click at the point where we want the line to start.
Let us move the mouse to the end point of the desired line.
Let us now click there with middle mouse button
The line is created with an arrow.
Remember, you have to press the middle button to complete the arrow.
Not the left or right button.
If you make a mistake, please click the Edit and press Undo.
Let us draw another line, at the output of the box, by copying.
Choose the COPY button from the left hand side panel.
Choose the line.
Move the mouse to the destination and click.
The line is copied.
Let us put some text now.
Let us click the Text box, indicated by T, from the left hand side panel.
Let us choose the font-size of the text.
Let us click the Text Size button from the attributes panel and obtain a dialog window.
Let us move the mouse to the value-box and keep the mouse there.
Let us delete the default value of 12 and enter 16.
Let us choose the button Set.
The dialog-box gets closed and the Text Size is now shown as 16 in the attributes panel.
We will centre align the text.
Let us click the Text Just button in the attributes panel.
A dialog-box opens.
Let us choose the middle one for centre alignment.
Let us click at the centre of the box.
I will type Plant and click the mouse.
The text is created.
I can move the text with the Move key on the left hand side panel, if required.
Let us now save this figure.
Let us click the File button at the top left hand corner of Xfig, hold and drag the mouse to Save and release.
As this is the first time, Xfig asks for the file name.
We can choose the directory and then the file name.
Let us type the name as "block" and choose Save.
The file gets saved as "block.fig".
You can see that name at the top.
Let us now export the file.
Let us click the File button once again, hold and drag the mouse to Export.
Click the box next to Language, hold and drag the mouse to PDF and release the key to select the PDF Format.
Now click the Export button. We get the file "block.pdf".
Let us open this file through the command open block.pdf from the terminal.
We now have the block diagram that we wanted.
We have completed our objective. We have the figure we want.
We have an assignment for you.
Substitute the box with different objects.
Create a rectangle using Polyline. Change the size and the direction of the arrows in the figure.
Move the text, line and box to different locations.
Export the file in 'eps' format and view it.
View the file "block.fig" in an editor and identify different components.
Create entirely different block diagrams.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.
Spoken Tutorial is a part of the Talk to a Teacherproject, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT),MHRD,Government of India.
I have downloaded a few more web pages.
The website for the spoken tutorial project is:
This project is explained by the video available at this link: "What is a Spoken Tutorial".
At this spoken-tutorial.org/wiki, we have listed the FOSS tools supported by our projects.
Let us also see the page devoted to Xfig.
We welcome your participation and also your feedback. This is Kannan Moudgalya, signing off. Thanks for joining. Goodbye.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Xcos: Scilab Connected Object Simulator.
Xcos is a Scilab package for modeling and simulation of dynamical systems. It includes both continuous and discrete systems.
In this tutorial you will learn What is XCOS.  What is palette, Build block diagrams in Xcos
Setup the parameters of blocks, Setup the simulation parameters, Simulate the constructed block diagram.
To practice this tutorial, Scilab should be installed on your system.
I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 and Scilab version 5.3.3 for demonstration.
Open the Scilab console window on your computer.
Go to applications and select XcosOR Type xcos in your Scilab console window and press Enter
By doing this, two windows will open. The two windows arePalette browser and Untitled-Xcos window
In Palette browser, you will find different types of blocks Commonly Used Blocks
Continuous time system blocks , Discrete time systems blocks and many more.
The other window, Untitled-Xcos is blank, with grids.
We will now simulate a first order system with a step input.
To begin, I will select a transfer function block from the Continuous time systems palette.
Drag this block to the Untitled-Xcos window.
Select the required source in the Sources palette. I will scroll down and use the STEP FUNCTION block.
I will drag and place it before the transfer function block.
Similarly, the output is displayed using the CSCOPE block, which is available in Sinks palette.
The CSCOPE block is placed after the transfer function block.
The red input port in CSCOPE denotes that this block is an “event driven” block.
It needs an event input for execution.
An event generator block is available in the Event handling palette.
The name of this block is Clock underscore c.
Drag and place this block above the CSCOPE block.
We have collected all the required blocks to do the simulation.
Let us now connect the blocks together.
Select the output port of step function block and connect it to the input port of the transfer function block.
Notice that the selected input port gets highlighted in green colour.
Similarly, connect the remaining blocks as shown.
Now we will set the parameters of each block.
First, go to the step block and double-click on it.
A pop up window appears, asking for the value of Step Time, Initial Value and Final Value.
Step Time is the time at which the step change will occur.We will keep it as 1, which is the default value.
Initial Value is the initial output value of the step function.
We will keep it as 0, which is the default value.
Final Value is the output of the step function, after the Step Time is lapsed.We will change it to 2.
Click on OK.
Follow the similar procedure to configure any other block.
For transfer function block, the following configuration is required. Numerator value in laplace domain has to be entered.
We will keep it as 1, which is the default value.
Denominator value in laplace domain has to entered. We will change it to 2 asterisk s plus 1.Click on OK.
Double click on CSCOPE block, to configure the following parameters.
The value of Ymin and Ymax should be set, depending on the range of the value, of the variable to be plotted.
Set the value of Ymin to 0.
Since I have given step input as 2, to display the output on graph, I should change the Ymax to any higher value.
We will change it to 3.
Make a mental note of the default value of the refresh period.The default value is 30.
We will keep the other parameters unchanged.Click on OK.
Now go to the Simulation in menu bar and click on Setup.
A pop up window appears.
We will change the value of Final integration time.Final integration time decides how long the simulation will run.
Recall the value of refresh period of the CSCOPE block.
I will keep the value of Final integration time equal to the value of refresh period of CSCOPE block
So, I will change it to 30.
Keep the other parameters unchanged. Click on OK.
Now press Control S to save the file, with a suitable file name.I will save it as firstorder.xcos
To start the simulation, click on the Start button, available on the menu bar of Xcos window.
A Graphic window will open, showing the step response of the first order transfer function.
We can save this plot as an image file.
To save the graph, go to the File menu and click on Export to option.
I will name it as firstorder.png and click on OK
There are certain parameters which we chose to keep as the default value. These can be changed.
For example In the Clock underscore c block, the period, which means the sampling period and initial time can be set.
In the CSCOPE block, the output window number,
position, size, buffer size, graph color etc. can also be set.
Pause the video here and solve the exercise given with the video.
Simulate a second order transfer function with damping ratio of 0.5 and angular frequency equal to 1.
Try changing the color of output graph.
Using the first exercise, plot the Step input and the output in a single plot window.
Now let us summarize.In this tutorial we have learnt to: Create Xcos simulation diagrams using the palette browser
Configure each block as per the simulation requirements
Setup the simulation parameters. Save the output plot.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Array Functions and Operations.
how to perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices,
how to use array conversion functions.
To record this tutorial, I am using OpenModelica 1.9.2, Ubuntu Operating System version 14.04 and  gedit.
Windows users may use any text-editor like Notepad instead of gedit.
To understand and practice this tutorial, you need knowledge of function and array declaration in Modelica.
Prerequisite tutorials are mentioned on our website. Please go through them.
Let us learn more about OMShell now.
OMShell is an interactive command line tool.
It is a part of OpenModelica.
OpenModelica compiler can be invoked using commands typed in OMShell.
It can be used for loading classes and simulating them.
Functions can also be called in OMShell.
We shall now use classes named polynomialEvaluatorUsingVectors and functionTester to demonstrate OMShell.
These classes were discussed in previous tutorials.
For more information on these classes, please watch the prerequisite tutorials.
All the commands to be used in this tutorial are provided in a file named OMShell-commands.txt.
You may locate and download all the code files available on our website.
Please save all these code files in one directory for easy access.
Now let me launch OMShell.
To open OMShell on Ubuntu Operating System, click on Dash Home icon at top left in the launcher.
Type OMShell in the search bar.
Click on OMShell icon.
In Windows, you may find the icon in Start menu.
Now, let us learn a few useful commands.
Firstly, go to the location where you saved the text file named OMShell-commands.txt and open it.
Note that this file has all the commands to be used in this tutorial.
Hence, you may refer to this file whenever in doubt.
Now let me switch to OMShell.
Type: cd open and close parentheses.
Press Enter to display the result produced on execution of the command.
This prints the path to current directory.
Now, let us change current directory to the location where you have saved the code files.
Let me change directory on my system.
Type: cd open and close parentheses, within double quotes specify the path. Press Enter.
Note that a Windows path uses forward slash unlike the backward slash used in Ubuntu.
Windows users need to be cautious of this fact.
Now, let us load polynomialEvaluatorUsingVectors function.
Type loadFile within parentheses within double quotes polynomialEvaluatorUsingVectors.mo.
Note that F is upper-case in loadFile() command.
This command can be used to load class or model files with a file extension of .mo.
If the file is found, OMShell returns true.
Now, let us call this function interactively.
Type: polynomialEvaluatorUsingVectors with an argument of 10. Press Enter.
This command takes an input argument of 10 units and displays the result.
Let me now load functionTester class.
Type: loadFile open and close parentheses within double quotes functionTester.mo. Press Enter.
Now, let us simulate functionTester class.
Type simulate within parentheses functionTester comma startTime equals 0 stopTime equals 1. Press Enter.
The simulation is now complete.
Let us plot variable z from functionTester class.
Type plot within parentheses within curly braces z and press Enter.
This command generates a plot of variable z vs time.
Now let me go back to the slides.
Array construction functions are used to construct arrays of given size.
Now let us take a look at a few array construction functions.
We will also practice them using OMShell.
fill() is a function used to create an array with all the elements same. The syntax for fill is as shown.
First argument represents the number which fills the array.
Remaining arguments represent the size of each dimension.
zeros() is a function used to create an array filled with zeros.  Syntax for zeros() function is as shown.
Arguments represent the size of each dimension of the array.
identity() function creates an identity matrix. It takes one argument that represents the size of both dimensions.
Now, let me demonstrate these functions using OMShell.
Let me go back to OMShell.
Type: fill within parentheses  5 comma 2 comma 2.
This command generates a two by two matrix with all its elements being 5.
The first argument represents the element to be filled within the array.
2 represents the size of first dimension
and the third argument 2, represents the size of second dimension.
The result is as expected.
Elements with one set of curly braces represent a row.
Hence this matrix has two rows and two columns.
Now, let us use zeros() function to create a two by two matrix with all its elements zero.
Type: zeros within parentheses 2 comma  2 and press Enter.
The result is as expected.
Let us now try identity function.
Type: identity(3).
This creates an identity matrix which is 3 by 3 in its size.
We can also perform arithmetic operations and use assignment statements in OMShell.
Let us create two matrices and perform arithmetic operations on them.
Type: a colon equals within square brackets 1 comma 2 semicolon 3 comma 4.
Comma is used to separate elements in a row
whereas semi-colon is used to separate rows themselves. Now press Enter.
Type: b colon equals identity of 2.
This generates a 2 by 2 identity matrix.
Now, let us perform arithmetic operations on a and b.
Type: a plus b and press Enter.
This performs matrix addition.
Type a asterisk  b.
This performs matrix multiplication. Press Enter.
Type: a dot asterisk b and press Enter.
This performs element-wise multiplication of the two matrices.
Note that it is not necessary to define data-types of variables used in OMShell.
Reduction functions take array as input and return scalar as output.
min() is a function which returns the smallest value in an array.
Similarly, max() function returns the largest value in an array. sum() returns the sum of all elements and product() returns the product of all elements.
Let me switch to OMShell to demonstrate these functions.
Let me create a new matrix.
x colon equals within square brackets 3 comma 4 semicolon 5 comma 6.
Type: min (x) to obtain the minimum value of x.
Type: max (x) to obtain the largest value in array x.
Similarly, type: sum (x) to obtain the sum of all elements
and product (x) to obtain the product of individual elements min array x.
Let me go back to the slides once again.
Let us now discuss various other functions that take an array as input.
abs() is a function which returns an array with the absolute values of all its elements.
size() returns a vector with the size of each dimension.
ndims() returns the number of dimensions in an array.
In this tutorial, we used OMShell to interactively demonstrate array functions.
These functions are part of Modelica language specification.
Hence, they may be used while writing classes in OMEdit as well.
As an assignment, apply abs(), ndims() and size() functions to an array.
Secondly, we have used a two-dimensional array or matrix as an argument to most of the functions.
As an assignment, implement all these functions with three-dimensional arrays.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Acid-Base Titrations using Vlabs.
In this tutorial we will learn to standardise:
To follow this tutorial you should be familiar with- ChemCollective Vlabs interface.
If not for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
Here I am using
ChemCollective Vlabs version 2.1.0
Here I have opened Virtual Chemistry labs application window.
Let us begin the demonstration with standardization of strong acid with strong base.
We will retrieve required chemicals from stockroom.
Now double click to Select, 0.1 Molar Hydrochloric acid from the list.
From the  Strong-bases cabinet, select, 0.1 Molar sodium hydroxide.
From the Indicators cabinet select Phenolphthalein.
Drag the bottle and drop on the workbench.
Click on Glassware menu.
10 mL Pipet and 50 mL Buret.
Rename the Erlenmeyer Flask as A1.
Using pipet transfer 20 mL of Hydrochloric acid(HCl) into flask A1.
Place the 10 mL pipet on flask containing Hydrochloric acid(HCl).
In the Transfer Amount input-bar type 10.
Drag the Pipet on to flask A1.
In the Transfer Amount input-bar type 10.
We require 20 mL of HCl for this titration.
Since we have 10 mL pipet we need to use it twice to transfer 20 mL of Hydrochloric acid(HCl).
Place Phenolphthalein bottle over  Flask A1.
Type 0.3 in the Transfer Amount input bar.
Keep Phenolphthalein bottle and Hydrochloric acid(HCl) aside.
Drag and place 0.1 Molar Sodium hydroxide(NaOH) over the burete.
Transfer 50 mL of Sodium hydroxide(NaOH) into the buret.
This is because the lower part of the burete is also filled.
Place the burete over Flask A1.
Note the initial volume of Sodium hydroxide(NaOH) in the buret from the Solution Info panel.
Change the Transfer Bar to Realistic Transfer.
Reaction between Hydrochloric acid(HCl) and Sodium hydroxide(NaOH) is equimolar.
So, end point is expected around 20 mL.
To obtain accurate volume for end-point detection; After adding 19 mL of Sodium hydroxide(NaOH), change the Transfer Bar to Significant Figures Transfer.
In the Transfer Amount input bar type 0.01.
This will transfer 0.01 mL of Sodium hydroxide(NaOH) for every click on the pour button.
Observe the pH change in the Solution Info panel.
Click on pour button, observe the faint pink colour in Flask A1.
Click on the buret.
Final calculations are shown on this slide.
We have used the formula M1V1= M2V2 to calculate M1 that is molarity of Hydrochloric acid(HCl).
We have obtained the  value of  M1 as 0.1 M.
To clear the workbench,  select each component .
To remove the selected component, click on remove tool.
Similarly remove all the components  from the workbench.
Let us retrieve solutions for the titration of Strong-acid with Weak-base.
Double-click on Strong-acids cabinet and select 1 Molar Hydrochloric acid(HCl). .
Now  double click on  Weak-bases cabinet and select 1 Molar Ammonia.
For this experiment let us choose methyl orange as indicator.
Drag and place it on the workbench.
Double-click on Glassware menu.
250 mL Erlenmeyer Flask.
Rearrange the apparatus.
Rename the Erlenmeyer Flask as A2.
Change the Transfer Bar to precise transfer.
Using pipet transfer 20 mL of Ammonia  into flask A2.
Place 10 mL pipet on flask containing Ammonia.
In the Transfer Amount input-bar type 10.
Drag the Pipet on to flask A2.
In the Transfer Amount input-bar type 10.
We need 20 mL of Ammonia, so pipette out twice into flask A2.
Transfer 0.3 mL of methyl orange into flask A2.
Drag and place 1 M Hydrochloric acid over the buret.
Transfer 50 mL of Hydrochloric acid into the buret.
Place the buret over flask A2.
Let us start the titration.
Change the Transfer Bar to Realistic Transfer.
Reaction between Hydrochloric acid(HCl) and ammonia is equimolar.
To obtain accurate volume for end-point detection;
In the transfer amount input bar type 0.01. Click on Pour
This will transfer 0.01 mL of Hydrochloric acid(HCl) for every click on pour button.
As we  titrate observe the increase in temperature.
Observe the pH changes.
Transfer a few more drops of Hydrochloric acid(HCl).
Note the final volume of Hydrochloric acid(HCl) from the Solution info panel.
Your final volume may be different from the value shown here.
Click on Spectrometer radio button.
Here are the final calculations.
Let us summarize . In this tutorial we have learnt to standardise;
Hint- All the necessary solutions and apparatus are available in default lab setup window.

Common escape sequences include \t (backslash t) for tab, \n (backslash n) for new line and \c (backslash c) is a escape sequence which when used, causes the prompt to be displayed on the same line.
This can be useful if say we want a prompt message before entering something.  Type at the prompt
It gives us only the time in hours, minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format.
It gives us the file permissions, file owner's name, last modification time, file size in bytes etc. Explanation of the fields of this option is beyond the scope of the present tutorial.
Now, you can see its contents. In fact, the other main use of cat is to create a file. For this, type at the prompt: cat space right angle- bracket space filename say file1 and press Enter.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Styling a Page using Themes.
As mentioned earlier, a Drupal website can look like anything we want.
In fact, here are some of the different looks and feels from several Drupal sites.
Notice that they are completely different.
This is based on the Theme.
Themes can make your Drupal site look like anything you want.
Here are a few things to remember about Themes.
We can get Themes from a few different places.
Or, we can create our own Theme like Artisteer from Artisteer.com i.e. build it from scratch
Contributed Themes can be found at drupal.org/project/themes.
Block Regions are all determined by the Theme.
So, where we can place Blocks on our website, is a part of the theming process.
If we don't have the right region then its a Theme issue, not a Block issue.
Let's now understand Themes a little bit more.
We can get some fantastic free Themes at drupal.org.
Go to drupal.org/project/themes.
Let's take a look at some of the Themes that are available for Drupal.
Recall from our Modules tutorial, we have to filter by the Core compatibility of the Drupal version we're using.
There are 2205 Themes here. When we click on Drupal 8, this comes down to a smaller number.
With new theme additions, after this tutorial was recorded, you may see a higher number now.
Let’s talk about how to find and evaluate Themes.
This is very similar to Modules.
We will start here at drupal.org.
Now, when we filter by Core compatibility, they get automatically sorted by Most Installed.
Adaptive Theme is number one at this point
and Bootstrap is number two.
Let's click on Bootstrap.
Recall our DMV illustration from the Module tutorial? It’s the same thing here.
You have to read the documentation first.
Then check out the Maintainers.
And look at versions and project informations.
At the time of recording, this particular Theme is in Drupal 8 x 3.0 alpha 1 version.
And, there is a development version also.
Later on, there's going to be a Drupal 8 version of this Theme, up here in the green.
A Contributed Theme can have several flavors as well. There are 3 different kinds of Themes.
We can have a very simple Contributed Theme that you can configure to a point.
We can have Starter Themes like Bootstrap or Zen.
It will literally give you a blank screen and minor framework, in order to put your own CSS in.
Or, we can have a Base Theme that is designed to have other Sub-Themes placed on top of it, something like Adaptive Theme..
But the rules are all the same here.
Look at the documentation; look at the Maintainers and look at the versions.
We will install a Contributed Theme now.
Let’s go to drupal.org/project/zircon.
Scroll down. This is a nice Theme, that's been developed specifically for Drupal 7 and 8.
It's not used on many sites.
We will be using this theme because it is ready for Drupal 8, as of today.
Let us right-click on  tar.gz and copy that link. This is similar to installing Modules. Let’s go back to our site.
This time click on Appearance and Install new theme.
Again, same process as with Modules.
Let us paste that URL and then click Install.
The Theme is downloaded to our web server, and we are able to now turn it ON.
Click Install newly added themes.
Scroll down to the bottom.
And you'll see Zircon.
Click Install and set as default.
Now, as we learnt in the intro video-
Now, let's take a quick look at the settings.
Click on the word Settings.
We have the normal TOGGLE DISPLAY in Zircon
and the shortcut icon.
Once again, if you want to update the logo- that's under Global settings
And LOGO IMAGE SETTINGS,
Click Save
And then go to our site.
This is Zircon - a completely flexible, robust, and global friendly Theme for Drupal.
Let's head over to Structure and Blocks.
And click on Demonstrate block regions for Zircon.
We'll see a number of Block regions here.
A Header region. The Main menu needs to go in the Main menu Block Region because then it gets proper formatting.
There's a Slideshow region, in case you are using something like View Slideshow.
A Featured block region,
Help,
Panel First, Panel Second col 1, 2, 3 and 4. And then a Footer region.
Notice that some of the regions from our default Theme are no longer available.
Let's take a quick look and see what we need to do here.
There are a lot of stuff in the Header region. The Footer region to which we had assigned the "Powered by Drupal" block, no longer exists.
We will put that back into Footer.
It immediately disappears from the Header.
Let's take the Status message out of the Header and put it into messages.
Let's put the Footer menu again, down into Footer.
We'll leave Search, Site branding and User account menu where they are for now.
Primary menu is in the wrong spot but let's just take a quick look at that.
Click Save blocks.
Go back to our site.
And we'll see that the Main menu is nowhere to be found. That's because Primary menu doesn't exist in this Theme.
So, we will take our Main navigation and change that to Main menu.
Scrolling down.. let's take a quick look.
In our Content area, we've got the Help block.
Let us put that in Help.
Page title, Primary admin actions and Page Tabs are fine.
Sidebar first, Welcome to Drupalville, Book navigation, Recent Events Added and Tools.
Let's take the Tools menu and put that inside Sidebar second.
There are four Panel regions here in which we can place anything we want.
Now, click Save.
And let's take a look at what we did.
This is a lot better now.
Our menu is properly placed in the Main menu block region.
BOOK NAVIGATION, RECENTLY ADDED EVENTS on the left.
And the TOOLS are on the right, again Sidebar first and Sidebar second.
And all the content is in the middle.
A couple of things to point out here.
We've changed our themes. Everything has changed, except our content.
We've got new fonts, new font styles, new H3 tags, new Block regions, layouts and a new Footer area.
But what's not changed is our content and the actual layout of our content.
To change those, we will need to use Panels or Display fields.Those are the  add-on Modules that we can get from drupal.org.
Themes are fantastic. Now this is a really simple theme.There are also some very complex themes that we can get for Drupal.
You can come back to drupal.org/project/themes. Take a look at some of the Drupal 8 themes that are available.
Find some themes that you like, install them and play with them.
This is a great way to learn about how themes impact your site. You may find just the design that you want.
Let us summarize. In this tutorial we have learnt about:

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Banking and General Ledger in Front Accounting.
In this tutorial,we will learn to create
General Ledger Groups  and
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
To practise this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:
And you should have already set up an organisation or Company in FrontAccounting.
If not, for relevant FrontAccounting tutorials please visit this website.
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
Let us open the FrontAccounting interface.
Open the browser and type localhost slash account and press Enter.
The login page appears.
Type the username as admin and the password.
The FrontAccounting interface opens.
Click on Banking and General Ledger tab.
In the Maintenance panel we can see the options:
GL Account Groups and
Before we start with any transaction, we need to set the Charts of Accounts.
The Charts of Accounts in FrontAccounting is defined by Type, Class, Group and Account.
All transactions are charged to an Account, Group and Classes.
These are used to group transactions for reporting purposes.
In FrontAccounting, Account belongs to a Group and Group belongs to a Class
It will be reflected in the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss account statements as per the Account Group.
Switch back to the FrontAccounting interface.
The first step is to set the General Ledger Account Classes.
Click on GL Account Classes link in the Maintenance panel.
Here, by default the Class Name and Class Type are defined as:
Also, we can see that the Class ID is set for each Class Type.
We need to set this class before setting the Account Group.
Now we will see how to add a new class.
In the Class ID field, type 5. The Class ID should be a unique value.
In the Class Name field, type Equity.
Click on the Class Type drop-down box.
FrontAccounting follows this Class Type to present in the Balance Sheet.
Select the Class Type as Equity.
A message is displayed- 'New account class has been added'.
Here, we can see that the new Class “Equity” has been added to the third row.
This is because, in the default Class Type, Equity is on the third hierarchy level.
So, whenever a new Class is added, it takes the default place of that Class Type.
Now, let us see how to add GL Groups.
Go to the Banking and General Ledger tab.
Click on the GL Account Groups link in the Maintenance panel.
We can see the default Group Name, which shows GL Account Groups under the Class.
You can also see the Group ID is set according to the Class.
In the ID field, type the new Group ID as 12.
In the Name field, I will type Fixed Assets as the Group Name.
The Group Name “Fixed Assets” does not belong to any subgroup that is already available.
Hence, in the Subgroup field, keep the field as None.
Now, click on the Class drop-down box.
According to the Charts of Accounts, Fixed Assets comes under the class of Assets.
To save these changes, click on Add new button at the bottom of the window.
We can see an error message that says - "This account Group ID is already in use".
So a unique Class ID has to be added to each Group Name.
Let’s change the Group ID to 13.
Click on the Add new button at the bottom of the window.
This time we can see a message that says - "New account type has been added."
The new Group Name is added randomly within the class “Assets”.
Likewise, we can add our own Group Name.
Now, let us see how to add GL Accounts.
Click on the Banking and General Ledger tab.
Then click on GL Accounts link in the Maintenance panel.
Here also we need to type a unique code. It is a mandatory field.
In the Account Code field, I will type 1100 as the code.
You can give any code of your choice, if you wish to.
Click on the Account Name field.
You can give any name of your choice.
In the Account Group drop-down box, select the Account Group as Fixed Assets.
The Account Name Land and Building has to come under the Group Fixed Assets as per the Charts of Accounts.
Next, click on the Account status drop down menu.
Then click on Add Account button at the bottom of the window.
We can see the message - "New account has been added".
Now, click on the New account drop-down box at the top.
Each organisation will have their own set of account codes, as shown here.
Likewise, by following the above steps, you can create your own GL Accounts.
In this tutorial, We have learnt to create
As an assignment.
Now we have set the Charts of Accounts for our Company with new GL Accounts.

A script file myPlots.R.
Please download these files from the Code files link of this tutorial.
I have downloaded and moved these files to Plots folder.
This folder is located in myProject folder on my Desktop.
I have also set this folder as my Working Directory.
Let us switch to Rstudio.
Open the script myPlots.R in RStudio.
Run this script by clicking on Source button.
movies data frame opens in the Source window.
This data frame has 600 rows and 31 columns.
It means this data frame has 600 observations of 31 variables.
To know about more this dataframe, please refer to the Additional Material section on this website.
In the Source window, scroll from left to right to see the remaining objects of movies data frame.
Now we will learn how to plot a histogram of the object named runtime in movies.
A histogram is
A visual representation of the distribution of a dataset.
Used to plot the frequency of score occurrences in a continuous dataset
Let us switch to RStudio.
Click on the script myPlots.R
In the Source window, type hist, within parentheses movies dollar sign runtime.
Save the script and run the current line by pressing Run button.
The histogram appears in the Plots window.
Click on Zoom to maximize this plot.
In the histogram there are 9 bins.
Height of a bin represents the number of observations lying in that interval.
Now, we will learn how to add labels to this histogram.
Also, we will change the color of bins in this histogram.
For this, we will add more arguments to the hist function.
Close the histogram.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Here, we have used the following arguments:
main for adding title to the histogram
xlab for adding label to the x axis
xlim to set the range of values on x axis
col to set the color of bins
Run the current line.
In the Files and Plots window, click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
The labels and the title of histogram have been changed.
We can observe that most of the movies have the runtime of around 75 to 125 minutes.
Now we will modify the number of breaks in the histogram.
We can make the groups finer or coarser by modifying the number of breaks.
Close this plot.
Let us add breaks argument in hist function and set it to 4.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
In the Files and Plots window, click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
Now, there are five bins in the histogram.
Remember we had set breaks to be 4.
Close the plot.
In the Source window, click on movies.
I am scrolling from right to left.
Now, we will learn how to create a pie chart from the object genre in the movies data  frame.
A pie chart is
A circular chart.
Divided into wedge-like sectors, illustrating proportion.
The total value of the pie is always 100 percent.
Let us switch to RStudio.
First, we will make a table of the number of different genres.
For this, we use table function.
Click on the script myPlots.R
In the Source window, type the following command.
Run the last two lines.
We can see that there are 65 movies in Action & Adventure and 87 movies in Comedy.
Now, we draw a pie chart with genreCount.
Click on the script myPlots.R
In the Source window, type pie within parentheses genreCount.
Run the current line.
The pie chart appears in the Plots window.
Click on Zoom to maximize this pie chart.
We can see that Drama has largest share of movies.
Now, we will change the color of border in this pie chart.
For this, we will add more arguments to the pie function.
Close this plot.
In the Source window, type the following command.
Save the script and run the current line.
The modified pie chart appears in the Plots window.
Click on Zoom to maximize the plot.
Now, we will learn how to save this pie chart as an image on our computer.
Close this plot.
I am resizing the Files and Plots window.
In the Plots window, click on Export.
From the drop-down menu, select Save as Image.
A window named Save Plot as Image appears.
You can select the format in which you want to save your image.
I am saving it in JPEG format.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Variables in Perl.
In this tutorial, we will learn about variables in Perl.
I am using Ubuntu Linux12.04 operating system and
Perl 5.14.2  that is: Perl revision 5, version 14, and subversion 2.
Variables in Perl:
Variables are used for storing values like text strings, numbers or arrays.
Once a variable is declared, it can be used over and over again in the script.
Scalar represents a single value and can store scalars only.
Scalar variables are declared using $ (dollar) symbol.
Let us look at variable declaration.
A variable can be declared as follows: dollar priority semicolon.
Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Variables must begin with a letter or underscore (_).
And may contain letters, digits, underscores or a combination of above three.
Variables declared with CAPITAL letters have special meaning in Perl.
So, avoid declaring variables using capital letters.
Now open the Terminal and type:  gedit variables dot pl ampersand(&)
The ampersand will unlock the command prompt on the terminal. Now press Enter.
This will open the variables.pl file in gedit text editor.
dot pl (.pl) is the default extension of a Perl file.
Type the following in the file: dollar priority semicolon and press Enter.
So we have declared the variable priority.
You do not need to declare a variable before using it;
you can just use it into your code.
Now let us assign a numerical value to the variable priority.
For this, type: dollar priority space equal to space one semicolon
Next, type:
print space double quote Value of variable is: dollar priority backslash n close double quote semicolon and press Enter.
backslash n is the "new line" character.
Now save this file as variables.pl at any location.
In my case, it will get saved in home/amol directory. Now save this file.
Now, let us change the permissions of variables.pl file which we just now created.
To do so, on the Terminal type, chmod 755 variables dot pl
This will provide "read", "write" & "execute" rights to the file.
To compile this Perl script, on the Terminal,
type: perl hyphen c variables dot pl
Hyphen c switch compiles the Perl script for any compilation/syntax error.
This tells us that there is no syntax error in our script.
Now let us execute the Perl script by typing perl variables dot pl and press Enter.
The output displayed is as highlighted.
We can also assign a string value to the variable we declared.
Switch back to the Text editor window.
Instead of dollar priority equal to one; type:
dollar priority equal to in single quotes high;
Please note that  the assignments are evaluated from right to left.
A scalar can hold data of any type, be it a string, a number.
Save this file and compile the script once again by typing:
perl hyphen c variables dot pl now press Enter.
This tells us that there is no syntax error.
Execute the script by typing perl variables dot pl and press Enter.
The output is as shown.
Now switch back to the Text Editor window.
You can also use scalars within a double-quoted string as
dollar priority in double quotes string;
Save this file and close it.
Let us learn how to declare multiple variables.
To do so, open the new file in Text Editor.
OnTerminal, type:  gedit multivar dot pl space ampersand and press Enter.
This will open "multivar dot pl" file in text editor.
dollar firstVar comma dollar secondVar semicolon and press Enter.
To copy the value of variable dollar firstVar to dollar secondVar, type:
dollar firstVar space equal to space dollar secondVar semicolon and press Enter.
All mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, can be done on these variables.
Let us see how we can achieve this using Perl.
Switch to text editor.
And now let us assign the value 10 to both of these variables by typing,
dollar firstVar equal to dollar secondVar equal to ten semicolon and press Enter.
Now, to print these values, type:
print double quote firstVar: dollar firstVar and secondVar: dollar secondVar backslash n close double quotes  semicolon press Enter.
Now, let us add the values in the two variables.
For this, type:
dollar addition space equal to space dollar firstVar space plus space dollar secondVar semicolon and Press Enter.
Notice, we haven't declared the variable addition.
Once again, to print the value of the  variable addition, type:
print double quote Addition is dollar addition backslash n close double quote semicolon.
Save this file.
To compile this file, again on terminal type:
perl hyphen c multivar dot pl
There is no syntax error, so we can execute the script
by typing perl multivar dot pl.
This will produce an output as highlighted.
Similarly, try subtraction, multiplication and division.
I have written the code here.
Now, let us save this file and close it.
Now compile the file by typing
perl hyphen c multivar dot pl
There is no syntax error. So, we can execute the script as perl multivar dot pl
On execution, the output will look like this.
In this tutorial, we have learnt
to declare and use scalar variables in Perl.
Assignment:
Declare a number variable.
Assign   10 to it.
Print the variable declared.
Declare 2 string variables.
Assign these values to them - “Namaste ” and “India”.
Print those two variables one after the other.
If you do not have good bandwidth, you can  download and watch it.

Welcome to this tutorial on Attributes.
In this tutorial, we will learn to: change attributes of atoms, residues and models,
color atoms in a protein according to B-factor values,
color residues according to kdhydrophobicity values.
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Chimera interface . If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website.
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu OS version 14.04, Chimera version 1.10.2 , Mozilla Firefox browser 42.0  and a working internet connection.
Using command line, open the structure of Leucine zipper.
On the command text box, type:, open 1zik.  Press Enter.
The model on the panel is shown as ribbons.
Using Presets menu, change the display to Interactive 2 .
To hide water molecules, on the command line type:  delete solvent. Press Enter.
To change the display to sticks, type: rep stick. Press Enter.
Add hydrogens to the structure, type: addh .
Now, let us learn how to change the attributes of atoms and residues for this structure.
Attributes  are properties with names and values.
In Chimera, items such as atoms, bonds, residues and molecule models have Attributes.
There are different ways to change the Attributes.
Open the Model Panel using Favorites menu.
Model Panel dialog box appears on the screen.
Click on the attributes button on the right side of the panel.
Attributes dialog box for 1zik opens on the screen.
The dialog box has attribute list.
The list includes Molecule Attributes and its components- Atom, bond and residue attributes.
Select Molecule Attributes.
The available attributes are listed on the window.
For example - To change the display of aromatic rings, click on the button next to aromatic display.
Select True from the drop-down.
Select Aromatic ring style as disk.
Click on the color well next to aromatic color.
Select color from the color editor.
Observe the panel. All the aromatic rings are shown with disks in the center.
Change the display of the structure to ball and stick.
On the command line, type: rep bs
On the attributes dialog box, change the Van der Walls radii of the atoms.
Change the value of ball scale to 0.5. Press Enter.
Observe the panel. The atoms are shown with larger atomic radii.
Again click on Molecular Attributes check box.
From the list, click on Component Atom Attributes.
In the corresponding window, click on atom style button .
The drop-down menu has many options.
Click on sphere to change the display to cpk.
Select dot to bring back the sticks display.
Now click on Component Bond Attributes.
Here, there are options to change bond style to stick or wire.
Click on Component Residue Attributes.
Here we have options to change the attributes of the ribbon.
Using Presets menu, change the display of the structure on the panel to ribbons.
Now clicking the Attribute dialog-box.
Now, in the Attribute dialog-box, click on the color well next to ribbon color.  Select a ribbon color.
And click on close option to close the color editor.
There are options to change the cross-section of the ribbon and scaling.
Again, change the display to atoms using Presets menu.
Attributes can also be changed using Tools menu.
Click on Tools menu, scroll down to Structure Analysis.
And select Render by Attribute option from the sub-menu.
Render by attribute dialog box opens.
Here we have options to change the attributes of atoms, residues, molecules, segmentation regions etc.
Select atoms. Click on Render.
Click on Attribute list to check for available options.
The list shows two options: bfactor and occupancy
These two attributes can be read from the input PDB file.
Choose bfactor.
A histogram of values will appear  with colored vertical bars.
B-factor values are a measure of mobility in the macromolecule.
Atoms with low B-factor values belong to a part of the structure that is well ordered.
Atoms with large B-factor values belong to part of the structure that is very flexible.
PDB file for a protein structure contains B-factor information.
The vertical bars can be dragged along the histogram with the mouse.
The value of B-factor is displayed in the  Value  text box.
Drag the blue vertical bar to zero, red to 100.
Then fix the white bar at value 50.
Click on Colors button.
Check options for color atoms, keep opaque and color surfaces.
The default color palette is blue and red.
You can change the color palette, using drop-down menu.
Observe the panel. Atoms with high B-factor values are shown in red and least in blue.
As expected, atoms with high B-factors are on the outside of the structure.
Now, let us change the attributes of Residues.
In the Select by Attribute dialog box, click on Attributes button.
From the drop-down, select residues.
Click on Render.
The attributes for residues include kdHydrophobicity scale.
Click on kdHydrophobicity from the drop-down menu.
The values are displayed in the histogram.
kdHydrophobicity scales are values that define relative hydrophobicity of amino acid residues.
KdHydrophobicity values are positive for hydrophobic residues and Negative values for polar residues.
Hydrophobicity of the residues can be shown with colors or worms.
Choose Colors. By default, some of the parameters are selected.
Click on Apply button. Observe the panel.
The hydrophobic residues are colored in red, and polar residues are colored in blue.
Click on Worms button. Click on Apply.
Worms are modified ribbons that vary in radius.
Most hydrophobic residues face the interior of the structure.
By default, the more hydrophobic residues will be shown with larger radius.
To return the structure to normal ribbon:
click on worm-style button and choose non-worm option.
Close the Chimera session using File menu.
Let's summarize, In this tutorial, we have learnt to: change attributes of atoms, residues and models,
color atoms in a protein according to B-factor values,
color residues according to kdHydrophobicity values.
As an assignment,  Open a model of hemoglobin (PDB code: 2HCO) on the panel. Color the atoms according to B-factor values.
Color the residues according to  kdHydrophobicity values.

Warm greetings! Welcome to this tutorial on Stereoisomerism.
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Conformational isomerism,
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Avogadro interface.
Example files used in this tutorial are provided as code files.
In this tutorial, we will learn to build stereoisomers using Avogadro.
I will give a brief introduction about stereoiosmersism.
Stereoisomersism arises due to difference in spatial arrangement of atoms.
Isomers have same structure and hence do not differ much in properties.
Here is a slide that shows classification of isomers.
I will begin with Conformational isomerism.
It is a form of stereoisomerism.
In this, isomers can be inter-converted by rotation about single bonds.
Rotation about single bond is restricted by rotational energy barrier.
Let's begin with conformers of 1,2-dichloroethane.
1,2-dichloroethane exists in three conformers namely:
I have opened Avogadro window.
Click on Draw tool.
Click on the panel and drag to draw two atoms.
Select Chlorine from Element drop down.

In Draw settings menu, Carbon is selected as default element.
Let's draw cyclohexane structure in the boat form.
Click and drag to draw boat conformer of cyclohexane on the Panel.
To label the atoms, click on Label check box in the Display Types menu.
Please note labeling may not be same all the time.
Let us label the conformers as per our requirement.
Click on Selection tool, then right-click on first carbon atom.
A menu opens. Select Change label.
Change label of the atom text box opens.
In the New Label field, type 1 and click OK.
Next right-click on the second atom and change the label as 2.
Similarly, I will change the labels of atoms as 3, 4, 5 and 6.
We will convert boat to twist boat conformer.
Click on Manipulation Tool. Click on 2 and drag it upwards.
Click on 5 and drag it upwards. Click on 3 and drag it upwards.
We have twist boat on the Panel.
Now, we will convert twist boat to half chair conformer.
Click on 2 and drag it downwards.
Click on 5 and drag it downwards.
Click on 4 and drag it to horizontal position.
Adjust the positions of all carbon atoms if required, to get correct structure.
We have half chair on the Panel.
Now we will convert half chair  to chair conformer.
Click on 4 and drag it downwards.
Click on 1 and drag it downwards.
Adjust the positions of all carbon atoms if required, to get correct structure.
We have chair conformer on the Panel.
As an assignment,  draw various  conformers of Butane and Cyclopentane.
Now I will draw structures to demonstrate geometrical isomerism.
Geometrical isomerism arises due to different spatial arrangement of atoms around a double-bond.
Here, rotation of atoms or groups around double-bonded carbon is restricted.
For demonstration, I will draw  diamminedichloroplatinum(II) structure also known as cisplatin.
In Draw settings menu, click on Element drop down and select Other.
Select Platinum(Pt) from the table. Close the Periodic table window.
From Element drop down, select Chlorine.
Draw two chlorine bonds on Platinum atom on the same side.
Select Nitrogen from Element drop down. Draw two nitrogen bonds as before.
To complete the structure, we need three attached hydrogens on nitrogen atoms.
Select Hydrogen from Element drop down.
Click on each nitrogen atom to draw the third bond.
Let's optimize the structure.
Click on Auto Optimization tool.
In the Force Field, select UFF and click on Start button.
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
For demonstration, I will require two structures.
I will copy and paste the structures.
Click on Selection tool to select the structure.
Press CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste. Drag the pasted structure to right.
For convenience, I will label the atoms.
Click on Label check box in the Display Types menu.
To remove Hydrogens, go to Build menu and select Remove Hydrogens.
We have two isomers of cisplatin on the Panel.
I will convert the second cis isomer to trans isomer.
Click on Manipulation tool.
Click and drag Cl4 to  left. Click and drag N4 to right.
Then adjust the postions of all the bonds to show proper orientation.
Go to Build menu and select Add Hydrogens.
As before, each nitrogen has two atoms attached.
Add the third Hydrogen using Hydrogen from Draw tool.
Let's optimize the structures.
Click on Auto Optimization tool.
In the Force Field, select UFF and click on Start button.
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
We now have two geometrical isomers of diamminedichloroplatinum(II) on the Panel.
Similarly, we have the geometrical isomers of diamminetetracyanoferrate(III)ion [Fe(NH
Next we will discuss about  R-S configuration.
R-S configurations arise due to the presence of a Chiral centre.
Chiral centre is an atom connected to four different substituents.
Configurations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.
For demonstration of  R-S configurations, I will use amino acid - Alanine.
I will load Alanine structure from Fragment library.
All the amino acids available in the Fragment library are optically active.
You can load and explore on your own.
Press CTRL+SHIFT and A to deselect the structure.
Using the Navigation tool, rotate the structure for proper orientation.
Central carbon atom is chiral, attached to 4 different groups.
R S configuration is based on priority given to the substituent in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
Priority is based on atomic number of the substituent.
Substituent with higher atomic number gets first priority.
Now we see the priority in clockwise direction.
In this structure, nitrogen is given first priority.
Carbon attached with oxygens is given second priority. And methyl is given third priority.
Structure has R configuration.
I will change the positions of the attached groups to the chiral carbon.
Go to Build menu and select Remove Hydrogens.
Click on Manipulation tool.
Move carbon to right side.
Move carbon attached to oxygens to left.
Go to Build menu and select Add Hydrogens.
Now we will see the priority in anti-clockwise direction.
Nitrogen has first priority. Carbon attached with oxygen is given second priority.
Structure has S configuration.
Similarly, we have R and S configurations of Glyceraldehyde on the Panel.
In this tutorial, we have learnt to draw:
As an assignment, draw Geometrical isomers of 2-butene and 1,2-dichloroethene,  R-S configurations of bromochloroiodomethane.

And also definitely applicable to all the videos I will or have already made.
So first, I'll echo out mb_substring().
As long as I start from zero, I can put the string length  in there or rather sorry, '$length' in there and as we refresh we get the whole of the string.
This is the second value.
Let's check that out.
Let me get rid of this.
Ok, so let's try it out.
Let's keep it as that.
Ok, so I'll stop this video here as I'm running out of time. There's a second part for the rest of these functions.  Be sure to catch it.
